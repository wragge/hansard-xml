<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed cuts in funding to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will have serious effects on the viability of many family chemists, leading to increased charges and reduction in services and availability of medicines to the community.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to reject the findings of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal and maintain the level of funding existing prior to the Tribunal's findings.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> This humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the Senate to the Government's attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we as Australians have a right.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request the Senate to urge the Government to guarantee an adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so as to ensure the continued viability of neighbourhood pharmaceutical services through our local community pharmacies.</PARA>

<TITLE>Privacy Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>The Hawke Labor Government's Privacy Amendment Bill concerning credit reference reporting will-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Prohibit many legitimate uses of credit information by organisations such as insurance companies, real estate agents, businesses selling goods on credit, and companies renting or leasing goods and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Add to the cost of business and increase interest rates and insurance charges and lead to over commitment by borrowers.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pornography</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, with the open sale and/or hire of only ``G'', ``PG'' and ``M''-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of ``R''-rated video-cassettes, so that ``R''-rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X''-rated or ``NVE''-rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walters' Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video-cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported;</PARA>
<PARA> that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the Australian Capital Territory Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material;</PARA>
<PARA> that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Exclude from the `R'-rated all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> If open not-for-profit health funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> Some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that there is widespread community concern regarding:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the almost total dependence in Australia on fossil, fuel and their deleterious effects in producing the greenhouse phenomenon in the environment;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposal to spend millions of dollars on research into nuclear power, the production of which has in other countries proven expensive and dangerous; and</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Lotteries Ordinance 1989, as contained in Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No. 4 of 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The Ordinance legalises approved public lotteries and approved betting schemes and provides for their control. The Committee was concerned, however, at some aspects of the operation of the general scheme of supervision as provided in the instrument. </PARA>
<PARA>The core provision of the Ordinance is that the Minister may grant or refuse approval of lotteries and betting schemes and impose conditions or requirements on such approval. There are no detailed criteria to guide the exercise of this discretion, although there are some broad guidelines. More importantly, however, there is no right of review of a decision of the Minister. The Ordinance seems to contemplate approvals of lotteries and betting schemes operated for charitable or recreational purposes by sporting or social clubs, although the Explanatory Statement gives no indication of this. </PARA>
<PARA>In such situations, where there is a multiplicity of applications, approvals and conditions, a right of review of the merits of a decision will often be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee looked particularly closely at these present provisions as there is express provision for the Minister to delegate this discretion, apparently to any person at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Where the Minister is empowered to delegate decision making power to a public official or even, as here, to any person, then the Committee believes the case for independent review is stronger. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted with approval ``reasonability'' requirements in provisions which require the production of documents to an authorised person. There is, however, one provision which empowers an authorised person to demand information and to require the answer to questions, with only the subjective proviso that the information is considered necessary for an audit. Failure to comply is an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment. In such cases the Committee believes the objective expression ``reasonably considers necessary'' is preferable. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, a provision which deals with directions for the conduct of a lottery includes some ``reasonability'' requirements but in one case provides the subjective ``considers necessary'' rather than the objective ``reasonably considers necessary''. Contravention of a direction is punishable by fine or imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, an authorised person, who apparently need not even be a public official, is authorised to enter any place where a lottery is to be drawn, with no restriction on this power of entry by reference to a warrant or to a time of day or night when entry may be effected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, the Hon Clyde Holding MP, agreed to amend the Ordinance to meet the concerns of the Committee. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for this co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories</PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Lotteries Ordinance 1989, Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No 4 of 1989, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 5 October 1989. The Committee was concerned with several aspects of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 4 of the Ordinance provides that the Minister may grant or refuse approval of lotteries and betting schemes subject to any conditions or requirements. The Ordinance does not appear to provide any detailed criteria for the exercise of this power, nor does there seem to be a right of review of the Minister's actions. In addition, there is provision in section 19 for the Minister to delegate this power, apparently to any person. The Committee notes that permission to operate a lottery may be of considerable commercial value. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 12 provides for the production of documents to an auditor. These provisions include some ``reasonability'' requirements but under s. 12 (3) a person may be required to produce any information in that person's possession or to which that person has access ``that the authorised person considers necessary for the purposes of the audit''. The Committee believes that such provisions should be ``reasonably necessary''. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 17 similarly includes some ``reasonability'' requirements and the Committee asks whether the provision for directions given under s. 17 (2) (b) could not be amended to limit these to ``reasonable directions''. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 17 (2) (a) provides that ``A person authorised to supervise the conduct of a lottery may . . . enter any place in which the lottery is being, or is to be, drawn''. There appears to be no restriction on this power of entry. There is, for example, no requirement that entry be on the basis of a warrant, or any limitation on the time of day or night when entry may be effected or any requirement for reasonable entry. </PARA>
<PARA> The above are important concerns and the Committee awaits your advice. On a somewhat lighter note the Committee noted the definition of ``unlawful game'' in section 2. While all Members are aware of the game of ``two-up'' from its importance in Australian history and while some Members admit to having heard of ``dominoes'', ``gin-rummy'' and ``poker'', there is some difficulty with ``belankes'', ``chap jee ku'', ``fan-tan'', ``pakapoo'', ``punto banco'', ``swy'', ``thimble rig'', ``two pairs'' and ``unders and overs''. The Committee would welcome your advice that these games do not require further definition. </PARA>

<PARA>I refer to your letter dated 16 October 1989 concerning the Lotteries Ordinance 1989 of Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA>I propose to address each of the points the Committee raised. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 4</PARA>
<PARA>Under this section the Minister is empowered to grant or refuse approval for the application to conduct a lottery or pool betting scheme on Christmas Island and to impose any condition or requirement having regard to the need for it to be conducted fairly and for the interests of the subscribers to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee commented on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the absence of detailed criteria for the exercise of this power. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the absence of a provision for right of review of the Minister's actions. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the propriety of the delegation of the Minister's power apparently to any person (section 19). </PARA>
<PARA>I undertake to amend section 4 to provide for the right of review of the Minister's action as desired by the Committee, preferably using section 112 of the Casino Control Ordinance No. 4, 1988 of the Christmas Island as a model and to incorporate a provision for detailed criteria for the exercise of the Minister's power under section 4. </PARA>
<PARA>I also undertake to amend the delegation provision (section 19) to limit the persons to whom the Minister may delegate his or her powers to the Administrator, the Official Secretary or to an SES officer of the Department. I also undertake to amend the delegation provision to limit the persons to whom the Administrator may delegate his or her powers to the Official Secretary or to an SES officer of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 12</PARA>
<PARA>This section deals with the production of a statement and documents in relation to the conduct of a lottery for the purposes of an audit. I agree to amend subsection 12 (3) of the Ordinance so that the authorised person may require information that he/she considers reasonably necessary for the purposes of the audit. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 17</PARA>
<PARA>This provision empowers the person authorised by the Administrator to supervise the conduct of a lottery to enter any place in which the lottery is being, or is to be, drawn and to give such directions as he/she considers desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee commented that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) there appears to be no restriction on this power of entry. There is, for example, no requirement that entry be on the basis of a warrant, or any limitation on the time of day or night when entry may be effected or any requirement for reasonable entry. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) paragraph 17 (2) (b) could be amended to limit the directions to be given by the person authorised to supervise the draw to such directions as are reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of paragraph 17 (2) (a) is to allow an authorised person to enter a place in which the lottery is being, or is to be, drawn to ensure that the lottery is conducted fairly. To meet the Committee's concerns, I undertake to amend paragraph 17 (2) (a) so that the authorised person's entry must be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>I also accept the Committee's comments in relation to paragraph 17 (2) (b) and undertake to amend that provision to insert ``reasonable'' before ``directions''. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 2</PARA>
<PARA>This section contains definitions used in the Ordinance, including the definition of ``unlawful game''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee sought my advice that some of the games referred to in the definition of ``unlawful game'' (for example ``belankes'', ``chap jee ku'', ``fan-tan'', ``pakapoo'', ``punto banco'', ``swy'', ``thimble rig'', ``two pairs'' and ``unders and overs'') do not require further definition. I am advised that these games do not require further definition and that these terms are well understood in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Committee for its comments. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Determination of Australian Design Rules as National Standards Order, as contained in Determination of Motor Vehicle Standards-Order No. 1 of 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Order was made under the National Standards Act 1989, which was intended to establish national uniform safety and environmental standards applying to the design and construction of all road vehicles, including trailers, supplied to the market for the first time, whether manufactured in Australia, imported new vehicles or imported secondhand vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The parent Act and Regulations made under its authority provide for monitoring all suppliers to the Australian market to ensure that vehicles not only conform, but continue to conform, with the applicable national standards.</PARA>
<PARA> From their comprehensive application and effect it is obvious that the standards are of great importance to the entire motor industry and have major commercial implications. The Order sets the Standards not by direct legislation but rather by incorporating material from a publication entitled ``Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicles and Trailers-3rd Edition'', issued by the Department of Transport and Communications as at 31 July 1989. The Order itself is two pages long but the incorporated material is some 2,900 pages long. It is stressed that these 2,900 pages are included not merely as an external guide or reference but actually are the standards themselves, with provision for numbering and citation. This lengthy material is, of course, Commonwealth legislation with a general effect no less than an Act or regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee emphasises that it has no difficulty with length as such. In the present standards, for example, much of the material is technical in nature and it is unlikely that the Senate would wish to debate such provisions as part of a Bill. Nevertheless, the Committee was concerned at a discretion granted to the Minister by the Order to deem a vehicle or component to comply with the national standard even though the vehicle or component meets a requirement by means other than those included in the standard. This discretion confers a power on the Minister to nullify the standards themselves as far as they specify the means of complying with a requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no criteria to guide or limit the exercise of this power and to that extent the power is unfettered. There are no requirements for tabling or disallowance or of any other form of publicity, scrutiny or control of any decisions of the Minister in regard to the power. There is no provision for any right of review of the merits of an adverse decision taken by the Minister. Any decision of the Minister pursuant to this power could have serious consequences for an individual manufacturer or even for the motor trade generally. The Committee had noted earlier that the parent Act provided wide review powers to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Similarly, during the Committee's scrutiny of the Regulations made under the Act the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, the Hon. Bob Brown MP, undertook to provide that discretions exercised under the Regulations are also subject to AAT review. In the present instance the Committee wished to see that the same safeguards that existed in respect of the Act and Regulations were extended to the Orders. The Committee believes that safeguards in delegated legislation should not be less than those included in the parent Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister agreed to amend the Orders to provide that the discretion of concern to the Committee should be subject to AAT review. The Committee thanks the Minister for this co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>27 October 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The Hon Bob Brown MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Land Transport and</PARA>
<PARA>Shipping Support</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the Determination of Australian Design Rules as National Standards Order, Determination of  Motor Vehicles Standards-Order No. 1 of 1989, made under section 7 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. The Committee considered the Order at its Meeting of 26 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that the order effectively incorporated the ``Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicles and Trailers-3rd Edition'', issued by the Department of Transport and Communications as at 31 July 1989. This publication consists of some 2,900 pages of standards. The Committee has no difficulty as such with the length of these standards, as it is not concerned with the policy of an instrument. Indeed, the highly technical nature of some of the standards are examples of an appropriate use of delegated legislation. Members of the Committee agreed that Parliament may not wish to debate that the wheels of a vehicle with a Nominal Tyre Size of 1400 X 20 should revolve 265 times per kilometre while wheels with a Nominal Tyre Size of 1400 X 24 should revolve 225 times per kilometre (ADR44/000 page 5). </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is, however, concerned at a provision of the short (two page) instrument itself. Paragraph 5 determined that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1) where a national standard imposes a requirement for the performance of a vehicle or component, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) a particular vehicle or component meets that requirement but does so by a means other than that specified in the national standard,</PARA>
<PARA>the vehicle or component may be deemed by the Minister to comply with the national standard''. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision confers an important discretion on the Minister. There are no criteria for its exercise and there appears on its face to be no external right of review of an adverse exercise of the discretion. The Committee notes the wide review provisions to the AAT in s. 39 of the parent Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989 and asks whether these cover a paragraph 5 decision. If it does not the Committee would appreciate your comments on the suitability of a right of review to the AAT in relation to adverse decisions on these matters, which could have important commercial and livelihood implications. In this context the Committee notes that the standards apply to all road vehicles, including trailers, supplied to the market for the first time, whether manufactured in Australia, imported new or imported second hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Your advice would be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Collins,</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter of 27 October 1989 relating to the concerns of your Committee about certain aspects of Order No. 1 under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. Specifically, you questioned whether or not the decisions under paragraph 5 of the order should be subject to external review. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in my letter of 26 October 1989, it has been my intention to provide that decisions taken under the Act were appellable. An amendment to the Act has recently been submitted to the Parliament within the portfolio Omnibus Bill, which seeks to achieve this aim. </PARA>
<PARA> I note your specific concern about paragraph 5 of the Order, and I shall also undertake to amend the Order to make any decisions under this provision appellable in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 to give effective protection to places listed in the Register of the National Estate. The Bill seeks to achieve this by making it possible to regulate to control actions by corporations that might adversely affect the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>Preamble</PARA>
<PARA>At present the Australian Heritage Commission Act, which has the long title `An Act to establish an Australian Heritage Commission', primarily concerns the identification and registration of National Estate areas and property by the Australian Heritage Commission. Most of the Act concerns the establishment, meetings, officers and finances of the Commission. Of the eight parts of the Act only one (Part V) deals with the actual protection of the National Estate and this Part presently only obliges Federal Ministers to apply existing relevant laws to restrain the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities from adversely affecting the National Estate unless he or she is satisfied that there is ``no feasible and prudent alternative''. </PARA>
<PARA>These provisions in the 1975 Act are not without value and I have left them unaltered in this Bill. However, it is abundantly clear that there is a need for legislation which allows specific prohibition of damaging activities by bodies other than the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities and with appropriate penalties to encourage compliance. As long ago as 1974 the Hope Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, while recommending the establishment of the Commission and the basic structure of the present Act, commented in some detail upon the wide Constitutional powers available to the Commonwealth. The Committee noted that powers such as the external affairs powers, the power relating to people of a particular race, and the trade and commerce power could be used to protect National Estate areas within the States which were not owned by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>And in the 1983 High Court decision on the Tasmanian Dams case, a majority of the judges held that the Commonwealth has the power to make a law regulating actions carried out for the purposes of the trading activities of trading corporations; for instance, logging to make woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA>More recently, Government Ministers have alluded to the powers latent in the Constitution and have threatened to apply them to specific disputes concerning National Estate areas. On the 25th of July, Senator Richardson, the Minister for the Environment, threatened to use the corporations power to over-ride the NSW Government if they broke an agreement-negotiated by Resources Minister Senator Cook-to abide by the recommendations of a Biological Resources Survey into the impact of logging on National Estate areas in the South East Forests of NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson also threatened to use Constitutional powers to protect the rainforests in Northern Queensland. He said that the exercise of these powers would cause disquiet in the states-including Labor governed states-but that his Government had the courage to do it if necessary. He also claimed that his sudden awareness of the effectiveness of Constitutional powers to conserve the environment was the result of new legal advice supplanting a prior opinion that these powers would be ineffective. It is hard to believe that Ministers of the Crown are so ill-advised; it is hard not to believe that it is the ``courage'' to take responsibility for protecting Australia's national assets that has been lacking. </PARA>
<PARA>Strong words have been the only evidence of courage so far. In a speech at an ALP dinner on the 22nd of August the Prime Minister said, referring to the NSW Government, ``If the State Government doesn't co-operate fully in the biological studies and in a full examination of alternatives to logging the South East National Estate Forests, my Government will bring down the full weight of its constitutional powers-including the corporations power-to achieve a solution''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has had ample opportunity to consider legislating on the basis of Constitutional powers to protect the environment. In a letter to the Prime Minister before the July ``Statement on the Environment'' Mr Phillip Toyne, Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, made explicit mention of the potential of the Constitution's corporations power. The ``Statement on the Environment'' would have been considerably enhanced if the Government had included a statement of intention to legislate on this basis to protect areas acknowledged to be of special value and significance. </PARA>
<PARA>Since our Government has not done this, I offer the instrument embodied in this Bill to its reluctant hands. There is no obligation in the amendments proposed by this Bill to exercise the powers it expresses, but it will realise these powers so that when needed they can readily be applied through regulation. We will no longer have to listen to Government Ministers speaking about nebulous Constitutional powers. Brave words will be replaced by responsible action. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will not affect the general operation of the Australian Heritage Commission. It introduces a two-tiered approach to the National Estate which leaves the functions of the Commission intact while giving powers to the Commonwealth to regulate the actions of corporations within National Estate areas. The Commission will continue to keep a Register of the National Estate and comply with existing requirements for public notification of proposed listings and removal of listings in the Register. </PARA>
<PARA>The interaction of the Australian Heritage Commission Act with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 is maintained. The Bill does not affect s. 44 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act which presently allows the Minister administering the Impact of Proposals Act to direct inquiries into ``matters relating to the national estate'' and also empowers the Commission to request that Minister to direct the holding of such an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Outline of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is concerned with protection of the National Estate. It amends the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 to achieve this aim. The fundamental change proposed in the Bill is the insertion of provisions which will allow the regulation of the activities of corporations in areas listed in the National Estate Register. This is achieved by reliance on the Commonwealth's power with respect to foreign corporations and trading or financial corporations (s. 51xx of the Constitution) and its powers with respect to the peoples of the Aboriginal race (s. 51xxvi of the Constitution). </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 inserts into the Principal Act a definition of the types of corporations which will be subject to regulation for the purposes of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>At present the Act merely requires the Australian Heritage Commission to identify places and objects worthy of inclusion in the Register, to advise the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in respect of the National Estate and furnish reports to the Minister on certain matters.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill sets up a two-tier form of protection for the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>Retention of Existing Provisions</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, it retains-with a minor amendment-the present provisions ss. 28-30 dealing with the responsibilities of the Commission and Commonwealth Ministers. It inserts a new heading ``Division 1-Responsibilities of Commission and Ministers'' to make this clear and inserts a new s. 28a stating that when regulations are in force the powers conferred by Division 1 will be exercised in a manner consistent with those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the National Estate by Regulation</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the Bill adds a new Division to Part V of the AHC Act headed ``Division 2-Prohibition of certain acts in the National Estate'' which empowers the making of regulations by the Governor-General to prohibit a corporation from taking or causing or permitting to be taken any action whether within or outside a place on the Register that adversely affects or might adversely affect to a significant degree a place in the Register. Corporations which contravene this provision would face a fine of $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed sub-section 30a (1) empowers the Governor-General to make regulations prohibiting corporations from doing certain actions in any place in the Register where the Governor-General is satisfied that the doing of any such acts will adversely affect that place. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed sub-section 30a (2) empowers the Governor-General to make similar regulations prohibiting actions outside any place in the Register which may adversely affect a place in the Register. Some environmental effects will not be stopped at the line on the map marking the boundary of an area listed in the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>A corporation infringing the proposed sub-sections 30a (1) and (2) will be liable to a penalty of $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of Aboriginal Sites</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives specific protection to Aboriginal sites in National Estate areas. Proposed sub-sections 30b (3) and (4) empower the Governor-General to make regulations protecting Aboriginal sites that are situated within a place that is in the Register which are of particular significance to Aboriginal people. The penalty for contravening regulations is a fine of $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Absolute and Conditional Prohibitions</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed s. 30c provides that regulations made under the Act may prohibit the doing of an act absolutely or may allow certain actions where specified conditions or restrictions are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>Injunctions</PARA>
<PARA>In proposed s. 30d of the Bill there is provision for certain parties to obtain injunctions and interim injunctions from the Federal Court restraining a corporation from breaching s. 30a. The parties that can seek injunctions include the Minister, a person whose use or enjoyment of any part of a place in the National Estate may be adversely affected and interested organisations whose activities relate to the conservation and protection of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>The granting of standing to such persons and groups is vitally important in laws dealing with the protection of the environment. Conservation groups may have specialised knowledge of the environment of particular areas. Legislation must include mechanisms to ensure that all relevant information is brought forward before decisions are made about places in the Register. </PARA>
<PARA>Responsibility of Corporation Employees</PARA>
<PARA>Another important provision in the Bill is the proposed s. 30e which makes officers or employees of a corporation who are `in any way, by act or omission directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or party to ``a corporations contravention of certain provisions guilty of an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $2000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.''</PARA>
<PARA>Daily Penalties</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed s. 30f provides for the imposition of daily penalties of up to $20,000 for each day where a corporation contravenes the Act for 2 or more days. </PARA>
<PARA>Application to the Commonwealth and Territories and Authorities of the Commonwealth and Territories</PARA>
<PARA>The final important provision in the Bill is proposed s. 30g which provides that regulations to protect the National Estate shall be binding on the Commonwealth and Territories and authorities of the Commonwealth and Territories. Although contravention of regulations made under the Act would not lead to conviction, injunctions can be sought to restrain these bodies from contravening or continuing to contravene regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Comments on the application of National Estate Protection Legislation</PARA>
<PARA>In a slightly more ideal world this legislation would not be necessary. Instead a referendum featuring broad political agreement would be held and the Constitution would be amended to give the Federal Government direct powers to protect and conserve areas, places and objects that are important parts of the natural and cultural inheritance of all Australians. This conservation role ought to be the responsibility of the Federal Government and our national assets should not be subject to baronial decisions by State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>As it is, the States make short-sighted decisions and the Federal Government is happy to ignore the damage until they are dragged reluctantly into disputes by widespread public concern. In 1979 the former president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions described our Federal system as `absurd folly, and `anachronistic lunacy' and looking at the management of the environment under this system it is easy to see why. And since a referendum is likely to remain merely a twinkle in the avuncular eye of Senator Richardson for a very long time, we will have to accept the next best thing; legislation based on existing powers in the Australian Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>I first began considering the possibility of proposing legislation to protect the National Estate based on the corporations power in the Australian Constitution early this year during a visit to Kakadu. I was given a paper that suggested the application of these powers, through legislation, to Kakadu. Subsequent events demonstrated a much more widespread application; the developing dispute between the NSW State Government and the Federal Government about logging in National Estate areas of the South East forests being a particular case in point. </PARA>
<PARA>I scarcely need to advise the Government on how it ought to apply the legislation proposed by this Bill to the National Estate areas of the South East forests since Ministers have been threatening to use these powers on a regular basis; in a syncopated response to belligerent `we will cut the forests down' statements from NSW Natural Resources Minister Mr Causley. I would only suggest that they will find it easier if the powers are first embodied in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a symbolic exercise to accompany this Bill I have prepared National Estate nominations for two places of particular cultural importance for Australia. They are Bondi and Manly beaches; sadly notable today for the horror stories of faecal and industrial pollution that appear almost daily in Sydney's media. I quote from the Statement of Significance that will be included in my nominations. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Statement of Significance</PARA>
<PARA> This nomination is one of two simultaneous nominations that propose the listing of Bondi and Manly beaches in the Register of the National Estate. Although these are different beaches, the qualities that make them both worthy of inclusion in the Register are essentially the same and these comments will be entered in both nomination application forms. </PARA>
<PARA> Bondi and Manly beaches are central to an important aspect of traditional European Australian culture. Criterion A.4 easily have been written with these beaches in mind; they are indeed important ``for their association with events, developments or cultural phases which have had a significant role in the human occupation and evolution of the nation''. They are also locations that are typical of ``a distinctive way of life that is locally in danger of being lost''-or severely curtailed (criterion B.2). </PARA>
<PARA> These beaches have been recreational sites since the early days of the colony and are historically central to the progressive introduction of daylight swimming, recreational beach culture, surf life-saving (and its associated ocean-beach sports) and board surfing into Australian culture (the attached bibliography contains detailed histories of both beaches.). </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's outstanding record of achievement in water sports owes much to the outdoors culture that grew from these beaches. They generated one version of the ``Manly'' bronzed Aussie myth and are also associated with an easygoing hedonism and a determination to balance endeavour relaxation that is still identified as a feature of the Australian character. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the beach was also the place where urban Australians grappled with nature face to face. The role of the beach as a source of challenge and self-affirmation is confirmed by the professionalism of the surf life-saving organisations. One of the occasional hazards of beach swimming, the shark, has become a powerful cultural symbol. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these observations apply to many Australian beaches but Bondi and Manly have historical primacy. They are among the most famous beaches in the world and their locations close to the centre of Australia's largest city is a vital part of their mythic significance. </PARA>
<PARA> These beaches have been subject to pollution by sewage for many years, but the rapid increase in the size of Sydney, coupled with a greater scientific and popular appreciation of the risks posed by both sewage and industrial waste, has led to widely publicised disgust and apprehension. Existing Water Board sewage processing practices and the current outfall modification will continue to degrade these valuable natural assets.''</PARA>
<PARA> I was surprised to find that these beaches were not already nominated since the criteria for listing in the Register could almost have been written to describe them. However, the loss we suffer by the current degradation of these beaches is representative of the malaise in our system of government that is allowing important parts of our natural and cultural heritage to be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere in Australia is raw growth more evident than in Sydney; nowhere is it less productive of real products of the type we are told we need; ships full of empty containers sail out of Sydney harbour. Successive State governments have failed to plan for this growth and this is particularly evident in the primitive arrangements for the disposal of Sydney's wastes. Necessary improvements have been constantly postponed and when action was taken it was always the stop-gap solution that was chosen-like the current outfall modification that may lessen but will not solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile the Commonwealth Government feels free to ignore problems that are nominally the responsibility of the States, even when our internationally famous beaches are being degraded-and vilified in the international press. The July ``Statement on the Environment'' said nothing about this problem and when the State Government decided to score some cheap points by rudely demanding that the Federal Government hand over to them the land formerly occupied by the ANZAC rifle range at Malabar so that they could build a sewage treatment plant, the Federal Government response was the equivalent of a short expletive. On neither side was there any intention to seek a real solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> This has to change and one step in the right direction is the extension of Commonwealth responsibility over places of national importance. By nominating our two most famous beaches for listing in the Register of the National Estate, I am not suggesting that regulations should immediately be passed to block off the flow of sewage and industrial waste through the ocean outfalls, but that the Commonwealth Government become involved in a real search for a permanent solution. In theory it might be possible to act against the Water Board; it's a moot point. It might also be possible to seek injunctions against identifiable industrial polluters even if they were legally dumping under New South Wales law. But the use of punitive provisions in legislation does not itself provide solutions to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is something of a paradox that our Minister for the Environment also holds in his capacious portfolio the responsibility for tourism. Before the airline strike the Golden Tourist was the migratory species that was going to solve our economic problems; enticed by our natural wonders this creature could be stroked to exude a copious flow of foreign exchange which could be used to soothe the bleeding sore of our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile we are laying waste the very natural assets that are meant to attract this beneficient creature; wasting not in an impulse of enthusiastic barbarism, but in a desperate and sneaky way like a child drug addict raiding its mother's handbag. We need the next cash fix and then we will be able to be responsible about our resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech on the 22nd of August the Prime Minister asserted that ``we can only have economically sustainable development if that development is environmentally sustainable''; the legislation proposed by this Bill will assist him by enabling him-or his successor-to protect our valuable National Estate areas from environmentally unsustainable development. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I am extremely pleased to introduce this Bill, which includes measures providing for the grant of secure title to land to Aboriginal people in the pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. These measures are part of a package agreed to recently by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments-an agreement which represents a significant breakthrough in obtaining land justice for Aboriginal people who either live or recently lived on pastoral properties, or whose traditional lands are on pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA>These people have had a long and until now virtually fruitless struggle to obtain secure title to land. Many live on pastoral properties or town camps in conditions equal to those found in third world countries. It is to the discredit of this nation that such conditions have been tolerated for so long. The provision of secure title to land is essential before these communities can be provided with the infrastructure and facilities necessary to improve their living conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Before describing the measures contained in the Bill, Mr President, let me review the long history of failed attempts by Governments to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1971 report of the Committee to Review the Situation of Aboriginals on Pastoral Properties in the Northern Territory, the so-called Gibb Report, recommended the excision from pastoral leases of community living areas. These living areas were envisaged as relatively small areas of land sufficient to meet the basic living needs of an Aboriginal community and to provide that community with a measure of autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA>In the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission in April 1974 Justice Woodward again drew attention to this need. Since that time, numerous Government Committees and independent inquiries have pointed out the urgent need to provide secure title to land to Aboriginal people in pastoral areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The over-riding problem has been that most land in the pastoral areas of the Territory is land leased from the Crown by pastoralists. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill 1975 introduced by the Whitlam Government included provisions to authorise an Aboriginal Land Commissioner to recommend the grant of land on a needs basis in certain areas including land under pastoral lease. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fraser Government did not proceed with this proposal. Thus the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (the Land Rights Act) provides for Aboriginal people to claim only unalienated Crown land or alienated Crown land held by or on behalf of Aboriginal people. As a consequence, several thousand Aboriginal people missed out on the right to acquire title to land in pastoral areas. </PARA>
<PARA>When this Government came to office in 1983, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Clyde Holding, initiated discussions with the Northern Territory Government to facilitate the granting of community living areas on pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA>Initially, in 1983, the Northern Territory Government proposed a Community Living Areas Bill. The then Chief Minister, Paul Everingham, acknowledged that for some time the Northern Territory Government had recognised the need for a proper legislative mechanism to enable excisions of community living areas to be achieved more smoothly. At that time only 12 excisions had been granted. However that Bill was not enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>Following extensive negotiations by the Commonwealth, in April 1985 the Northern Territory introduced administrative guidelines for excision applications, and undertook to accelerate the process of dealing with those applications. </PARA>
<PARA>For its part, the Commonwealth undertook to amend the Land Rights Act to limit the right of Aboriginal people to claim stock routes and reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments were enacted in June 1987. However, the Commonwealth said that they would not be proclaimed until arrangements were made for the granting of land to Aboriginal people ineligible to apply for excisions under the Northern Territory's guidelines. The proclamation of the amendments would have resulted in the immediate withdrawal of most land claims over stock routes and reserves from the jurisdiction of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Hand first became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1987, he began negotiations with the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, the Hon. Steve Hatton, to try and speed up the very slow progress on the provision of living areas. Unfortunately the Working Party established then to resolve the delay was later disbanded. </PARA>
<PARA>By early 1989 it had become clear that the rate of progress in issuing titles was unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>The real losers in the failed attempts by Governments to achieve a satisfactory resolution to this problem were of course the Aboriginal people themselves. People who had in many cases seen other Aboriginal people obtain land justice through the land claim processes available under the Land Rights Act were forced to endure years of protracted negotiations with little or no result. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory recommenced negotiations earlier this year. In September the two Governments reached an historic understanding when a Memorandum of Agreement was signed by the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill fulfils the Commonwealth's commitment under that agreement. For its part the Northern Territory has passed legislation which will provide a statutory mechanism to allow certain Aboriginal people to make applications for community living areas on pastoral properties. Land granted under that arrangement will be under freehold title in accordance with Territory Law. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the terms of the Memorandum, the Commonwealth undertook to amend the Land Rights Act as a matter of priority, to provide for the granting of certain parts of existing land claims to stock routes and reserves. At the same time the earlier amendment to the Act limiting claims over stock routes and travelling stock reserves will be proclaimed. The selection of the areas to be granted has been determined after consultation with the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>In deciding on the areas to be granted the Government has been concerned to ensure that the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement are adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA>The areas to be granted represent only a small proportion of the land subject to existing claims over stock routes and reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the total area of all of the parcels of land described in the Bill, some 2,312 sq km, represents only approximately 26% of the total stock route and reserve claims. Looking at the stock route component, the total area of the portions of stock routes to be granted represents approximately only 6% of the total stock route claims. </PARA>
<PARA>The area of land to be granted is about 0.17 per cent of the total area of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has taken steps to ensure that pastoral operations are not unreasonably interfered with by the granting of these areas of land. Where appropriate the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has sought relevant undertakings from the Aboriginal claimants for the continued use of station roads, bores or infrastructure by the pastoral lessees. In some instances, the areas have been amended to exclude access corridors or areas of particular concern to pastoralists or the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Before I go into the detail of the undertakings that have been given, or the land which has been given up by claimants, I want to make two general observations. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, these undertakings are really about sharing the country and the resources. In acceding to the requests of Mr Hand for undertakings, the Aboriginal claimants have again demonstrated a willingness to share their land with pastoral operations. This continued willingness to share, and to compromise, is a real tribute to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, where possible, every effort has been made to resolve issues of particular concern raised with Mr Hand by the Northern Territory by a letter of 25 September, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to detail the undertakings they have given. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the most important undertaking in respect of continuing pastoral operations relates to continued access to water resources. Claimants for the areas at Ammaroo, Alice Well, Black Tank Bore (on Bond Springs), Finke, Mount Peachy (on Maryvale), Henbury/Orange Creek, Mount Kathleen (on Loves Creek) and Undoolya Bore and Williams Bore (on Undoolya) have given undertakings to share access to bores with pastoralists. </PARA>
<PARA> In order that pastoral operations will not be inconvenienced by access problems, the claimants for areas at Ammaroo, Ranken River, Undoolya Bore, Forster Range (on Stirling), Mt Peachy, Henbury/Orange Creek and Mt Kathleen have given undertakings relating to the continued use of station roads which may cross the areas to be granted by the pastoralists concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there appears to be major station infrastructure situated on reserves, at Ammaroo, Mt Peachy and Ooratippra, claimants have undertaken to allow continued access by pastoralists to that infrastructure. As well, an undertaking has been given for the continued access across a stock route for cattle operations at Lorne Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> Undertakings have also been given relating to allowing the construction of a water pipeline through Undoolya Bore, the continued use of areas at Mt Solitaire (on Hamilton Downs) by the CSIRO, the grant of easements for the gas pipeline at Birdum (the Jommet Block) and at Elliott, and for the continuation for a reasonable period of a grazing licence affecting part of the land at Birdum. </PARA>
<PARA> The specifics of the undertakings which have been given will be discussed with the lessees of the relevant pastoral properties. I also put on notice that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will consider any requests for further undertakings which may be put to him by affected pastoralists or the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of Mr Hand's consultations with the Northern Territory Government, four areas, previously identified, have been excluded from this scheduling process because, in terms of the Memorandum of Agreement, agreement had been reached that the claimants' needs could be satisfactorily met by a grant under Northern Territory title of a portion of stock route and an adjacent excision. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand has also agreed to amend the descriptions of some of the areas to be granted to take into account particular concerns expressed to him by the Northern Territory. In particular, I ask honourable senators to note the following examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The southern boundary of the area to be granted in the Birdum locality has been amended to provide a greater distance between the area, and the town of Larrimah. </PARA>
<PARA> The south-east section of approximately 19 hectares of the area at Newcastle Waters has been excluded from the scheduling process because the claimants recognised the importance of that area in terms of the water needs of the town and surrounding district. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with concerns raised by the Northern Territory, an area used for cattle yards and a dip at Elliott has been excluded from the area to be scheduled. </PARA>
<PARA> At Finke, the claimants have given up most of the two stock route portions previously included in this area, limiting scheduling to a small section of stock route only. </PARA>
<PARA> At Henbury/Orange Creek, the original claim was for a length of a stock route cutting across two properties. The claimants have agreed to the granting of four separate portions, representing a reduction of more than 50% of the original claim. </PARA>
<PARA>Claimants have agreed to the amendment of the southern boundary of the area to be scheduled at the 16 Mile (Bond Springs), at the request of the pastoralist, to provide an access corridor for cattle operations. As well, the area containing the airstrip used by the Alice Springs Gliding Club has been excluded from scheduling. </PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion of the agreement between the two Governments and the action to be taken because of it finally provides some certainty for Aboriginal people who have been living in appalling conditions for so many years. It is my hope that living conditions for these people can now be quickly improved. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President</PARA>
<PARA>I turn now to the other provisions contained in this Bill. In 1987 complex new provisions streamlining processes relating to mineral exploration and mining on Aboriginal land were included in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill contains a number of measures to fine tune those new provisions. Currently, the new exploration and mining provisions do not apply to the Coronation Hill Project Area and the remainder of the Kakadu Conservation Zone. The amendments remove this anomaly by providing for the new provisions to apply to these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Other amendments to the exploration and mining provisions will allow for an agreement, entered into in relation to exploration, to continue after the end of exploration activity. This will allow for, among other things, rehabilitation of the land to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA>There are special provisions relating to the Eastern Areas on Groote Eylandt and the Coronation Hill Project area. These provisions will provide that, where land either is, or becomes, Aboriginal land, exploration licences can be issued without the Land Council's consent. However a terms and conditions agreement would be required to be entered into. The issue of mining interests on these areas will also be subject to a terms and conditions agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the provisions that relate to the Eastern Areas on Groote Eylandt they will allow a person to apply for a mining interest even if he has not held an exploration licence in respect of that land. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the Coronation Hill Project Area I wish to make it clear that this provision will only affect that area if and when it becomes Aboriginal Land. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the payment of mining royalty equivalents into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, subsection 63 (3) of the Act is dependent for its operation on the provisions of the former Mining Act of the Northern Territory. However, the Mineral Royalty Act now sets the amount of mining royalties for hard rock minerals and has changed the system from an ad valorem to a profits based royalty system. Subsection 63 (3) will be amended so that it can now function within the new royalty regime operating in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a provision which will allow for the modification by regulation of the boundaries of areas granted under the new parts of schedule 1. This power is provided to allow for minor correction of descriptions of the land where further survey or other evidence suggests that the boundaries have not been accurately described. The provision is not intended to permit major changes to the area of land to be granted and the power will not be available after the land has actually been granted. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other amendments of a miscellaneous nature which are set out in detail in the Bill and the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill together with the Northern Territory legislation which has been passed by the Legislative Assembly provides some measure of justice for deprived groups of Aboriginal people. These proposals to provide land for Aboriginal people are an important achievement by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope this agreement heralds a new era of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory Governments which can only lead to benefits for Aboriginal and non Aboriginal Territorians. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The votes for the Department of Finance would not, I think, normally be a very contentious area of the Appropriation Bills. The Department of Finance is one of the key coordinating departments of the Government and, as such, does not tend to have much in the way of what I might call clientele in the way that so many of the functional departments have. The role of the Department of Finance is rather, as its name perhaps implies, to administer, oversee, supervise and, I suppose, to a degree control on behalf of the Executive Government the expenditures of government. Although departments of finance, no more than departments of the treasury, can ever expect to be popular, nevertheless I do not think that there are very often charges laid-or at any rate, charges substantiated, as distinct from being laid-which are overly critical of that Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, there are some elements of the Department's appropriations and activities to which I want to make brief reference this morning. I begin by looking at the 1988-89 annual report of the Department of Finance, which was recently tabled in the Parliament. As I did not speak on that report at the time, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Department on the quality, presentation and general informativeness of its report. It is, I think, a credit to the Department, and that ought to be said. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not spend long on this particular point, but I cannot resist one minor digression. The chart on page 9 of the report sets out the management structure of the Department as at 1 June 1989. Looking at its divisional and branch structure, I notice many names which have a high degree of familiarity, although there are one or two in more elevated positions than I might otherwise have expected. For example, I notice that one of the deputy secretaries of the Department is now Mr Stephen Sedgwick, who I seem to recall was until recently an economic adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Mr Sedgwick appears to have had a rather accelerated rate of promotion, which I am sure was thoroughly deserved, and I congratulate him on that degree of advancement. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to the Department's functions. In particular I want to say something about the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and other superannuation areas that are administered by the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office and that, in policy terms, are the responsibility of the Department. I take this opportunity of saying that I regret that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is not here today. I regret his absence because I understand it is through illness, which is a matter for regret. But, as with many of his colleagues, I think the Minister is suffering from a degree of exhaustion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about that. The honourable senator is bigger than I am. I do not think we have to have these things out on that ground.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, we will see. No, I withdraw that. I accept that the Minister is less exhausted than many of his colleagues, and I pay tribute to him on that count. But there is no doubt that the Minister for Finance is exhausted. In view of the problems that he and one or two of his more economically rational colleagues have been having to contend with in recent times, that is not surprising. Contending with a Prime Minister who has quite clearly taken it upon himself to give the kind of `leadership' which this country could well do without-the kind of leadership which, for example, involves the breaking of written promises to our major company, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP), in relation to the development of the Coronation Hill deposit-would be enough to exhaust any Minister. That event subsequently led the Chairman of BHP, a most respected Australian, Sir Arvi Parbo, to say publicly on a radio program that, in the light of that and a number of other similar examples of prime ministerial leadership in recent times, Australia's name stinks in the world today, in Sir Arvi's words. I do not think anybody should take any pleasure from that comment by Sir Arvi; it is simply a sad reflection upon the position to which Australia has been led by a Prime Minister and, I suppose one has to say, his Cabinet generally-there is such a thing as collective responsibility-in their manic search for re-election, and to hell with the country in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I have digressed, and I am grateful to the Chair for its tolerance. I will now return to my initial remark, which was that the Minister for Finance is clearly exhausted and that has no doubt added to the health problems from which he appears to be suffering at the moment. I extend my sympathies to him in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I was about to say something about the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, in regard to which the Minister recently announced the outcome of a major review that has been undertaken over some time. That review is referred to in the Department's report but, as the report covers only the year 1988-89, it does not comment on the outcome of the review of the scheme. When recently announcing the outcome of that review the Minister made available a good deal of very useful and informative material for which I express the Opposition's gratitude. One element in the material that caught my eye-particularly in view of the fact that it was not very long after the Opposition's announcement of its Economic Action Plan-was the decision by the Government to tighten up very dramatically access by public servants covered by the Commonwealth superannuation scheme to the so-called invalidity provisions of that scheme. In announcing the outcome the Minister commented that retirements from Commonwealth employment under invalidity provisions have been running, in proportionate terms, at roughly five times those in the community generally. He went on to observe that in the case of Telecom Australia and Australia Post, whose employees are also at present covered by that scheme, the rate was as high as 10 times that in the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the announcement, quite clearly the Minister and the Government have concluded that a great deal of fraud and abuse of those invalidity provisions has been committed and that it is time to put a stop to those practices, or at least to exercise much greater control than has previously been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I advert to that topic not only because of its intrinsic interest, which I think is considerable anyway, and the fact that it is highly relevant to the appropriations of the Department, but also because, in this area, the Government has acknowledged what the Opposition said by way of a more general set of observations in our Economic Action Plan in relation to the need for, and the fiscal worth of, cutting down on the fraud and abuse which is rampant throughout large areas of our whole social security system. The Opposition has indicated that it proposes to move in that area, particularly in relation to unemployment benefits and the invalidity area. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the release of that plan there was some suggestion from Government Ministers to the effect that, once again, here was the Opposition kicking the poor to give to the rich, or some other highly emotive and colourful phrase of the kind that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) comes out with from time to time. It took him a week to get his act together to say anything on the subject. I want to underline the fact that here is the Government, through the mouth of its own Minister for Finance, providing substantial evidence in a particular area of the truth of the basic position as set out in the cost cutting proposals of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The other element of the Department's appropriations to which I wish to refer relates to the arrangements for natural disaster relief. As I very well recall, from the days when they used to be administered by the Treasury, those arrangements are of a fairly complex nature and have developed over a long period. To some degree it is fair to say that they have come into existence on an ad hoc basis and, I suppose, in a fairly arbitrary manner. They have come to reflect the accumulation of many decisions taken by successive governments in the light of particular circumstances such as, say, a cyclone in Darwin or the major flood in Queensland in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter to which I want particularly to refer is the fact that in its economic statement in April this year, the present Government decided to delete any provisions for drought relief from the arrangements for natural disaster relief. The strange thing about that is that-I think I am correct in saying this-it was drought relief, perhaps flood relief also, that was among the very earliest areas that brought these provisions into existence whereby the Commonwealth provided some assistance to State governments in relation to these natural disasters. These provisions really relate to areas which, strictly speaking, are within the constitutional responsibilities of State governments, which have responsibility to deal with flood damaged roads and culverts, major bush fires, and things of that kind. However, over the years a view developed that, where one had real disasters in these areas as distinct, say, from the normal acts of God, then it was probably proper, and certainly was found to be politically expedient by governments of both persuasions, to provide some additional assistance to State governments for dealing with these matters. I think I am correct in saying that drought relief was one of the very earliest areas where that came to pass. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that the Government should have decided in April this year to delete drought relief provisions from those areas where the Commonwealth properly provides assistance in extreme circumstances. The Commonwealth does not pick up the whole bill for drought relief, and nor should it; but in relation to extreme and prolonged droughts, the Commonwealth Government has taken the view over the years that it should begin to come to the party at some stage in situations where State governments would be financially embarrassed if they had to pick up the whole bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that the Government has made this decision. It is true that it has put in hand a review of what Commonwealth involvement there should be in future drought relief. That review is supposed to be completed by March of next year-whether it is completed before or after the election remains to be seen-but in the meantime there is a hiatus in this area. Fortunately, at present Australia does not have much drought, except in localised areas and no doubt those situations will be handled by State governments. However, I draw attention to what is a rather petty and somewhat vindictive decision by the Government, deriving from some personal fixation-I would say that it is almost an obsession-on the part of the Minister for Finance in relation to some particular instance in the past in Queensland-about which the Minister has his facts wrong, anyway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that same matter, I can only concur with Senator Stone's remarks. I regret that people of my own State of South Australia are no longer able to gain any Commonwealth financial assistance during a time of a disaster such as drought. Happily, this year there have been good rains and drought is not on our agenda, but it certainly was on the agenda in the previous year and the year before that. My recollection is that at least $40m was made available during the previous financial year, but no provision has been made for drought during this financial year because of this obsession or fixation by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). He happens to be a farmer who has a very disciplined approach to a number of areas, which is all well and good. But then he adds to that his obsession that the costs of drought should be built into the capital price of land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After a couple of centuries of Australians having to deal with drought, he has just announced that there will be no more Commonwealth assistance for drought relief because he has an obsession that any land to be purchased for primary purposes should not be purchased at the market value of recent years, taking into account inflation and various trends. Instead, the value is to be discounted so as to take account of any drought that may come. There is a kind of obsessive logic about that because one can calculate that a serious drought may occur once in 10 years and that the failure of a certain piece of land to produce once in 10 years will be a loss of, say, $1,000 an acre, so one has to build that into the value of land at the point of purchase. Such a proposition is not acceptable to me. When it is clearly the outcome of the personal judgment of one Minister, without there being a satisfactory explanation at any point, we want to persist with gaining at least some wider rationale from Senator Robert Ray, who is in the chamber, and to ask him to take the matter back to the Government for review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has imposed limitations on entitlement to the isolated children's allowance and assistance schemes for students generally by introducing a capital means test. It is not just the recurrent income which is tested to determine whether those allowances are payable for children undertaking education. If a property owned by a family exceeds a certain capital value it will not be possible for that family to receive any such allowance for education. When it was put squarely to Senator Walsh that all properties can have a disastrous year at some stage, such as in a drought, his answer was along similar lines. Again he had this obsessive logic, which I believe is not acceptable to honourable senators, that drought must be taken into account in the value of the property on which the farming is being undertaken and that in the good years money has to be set aside for education, because in a drought year when income falls to zero or is negative there is no way that the Hawke Labor Government will allow an educational allowance to go to a family in those circumstances. I believe that that is the outcome of the obsessive fixation of the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, despite his other qualities. I ask Senator Ray to give a further explanation, if that is possible, and, if not, to take the matter to the Government for review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone began his remarks by reviewing the organisation chart of the Department of Finance. I noted down the following point: `Stone warns of purge in Finance'. Taking the rest of his comments on board thereinafter, I think I will have to scrub off that point because he was not in fact doing so. Regarding Senator Stone's second point, it is part of the coalition's political agenda to argue that the Government is tired, that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is tired, et cetera. Ministers do get sick. Doug Anthony got hepatitis while he was a Minister. Peter Durack, unfortunately, suffered a heart attack as a Minister. I do not recall our making those points at that time. It is true to say that probably one of the most enervating jobs in government would be that of its Finance Minister. The Minister is required to attend not only Cabinet meetings but also Expenditure Review Committee meetings and every Cabinet subcommittee meeting. That is tiring and it may have contributed to Senator Walsh's illness. Who knows? I do not think necessarily that one can draw the conclusion that the whole Government is tired. I also suspect that Senator Walsh's irascibility in the early stages of his current illness and his more unorthodox treatment of it have probably delayed his return to the chamber somewhat, which is bad news for the winegrowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both Senator Stone and Senator Teague raised the question of drought. Essentially, it is the Government's view-it is not just Senator Walsh's view-that that is a State matter. Of course, States rights do not become involved in this argument. It is usually the other side of the chamber that argues that. However, I can answer the point raised by Senator Teague. He asked whether the matter is sitting there in limbo. It is not. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is heading up an interdepartmental committee to look at all these issues. If this one were ever to be resurrected it would be resurrected in Mr Kerin's area, one would think. That committee is due to report in March. Presumably at the next Estimates committee meeting Senator Teague will be able to follow it up to see what has happened. I note for the record that I have often seen graphs of rainfall. On the Australian average it has tended to be remarkably high, with some exceptions, from 1972 to 1975 and from 1983 to 1989. I often point out to farmers that there is a correlation between Labor governments and a lot of rainfall. How long that lasts depends on how long the Government stays in power, one would guess. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other remarks that I recall Senator Stone making were a few barbs at the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It was very cruel of him to do so. I can remember that when I suggested at the National Executive meeting of the Australian Labor Party in 1983 that we put a pink ticket in his pay packet he defended Senator Stone vigorously. I am sure that he has the same high regard for Senator Stone today as he had then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not normally rise again to speak to these estimates, but I must comment briefly on a couple of things the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) has said by way of his response. He mentioned that the view of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) in relation to drought relief arrangements is that it is a State matter. I think that I was careful in my remarks to say that it is, to a considerable degree, a State matter. There is no argument about that. It always has been. However, the reason for the institution of the Commonwealth arrangements for drought relief, as with other natural disasters which are also State matters, such as bushfires and floods, was that there comes a time in the development of these major natural disasters, including a major drought of a prolonged kind, when the view has been taken by governments of all political persuasions that the capacity for the States affected to carry the cost of that major disaster is inadequate and, therefore, the States concerned-of course, this varies from time to time, as it is rather unusual for a drought to cover the whole of Australia-have been provided with some supplementary assistance. That has been the basis on which drought relief has been provided in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is wrong for the Minister to suggest that this is or should be regarded as a matter of clean-cut State responsibility, because it is the Commonwealth's responsibility. Normally I would have a lot of sympathy for the view that too much confusion between these two areas of responsibility in financial arrangements has grown up in Australia over many years. The only other point I want to make is that when the Minister refers to a propensity to rain during the time of Labor governments, it seems to be more or less a suggestion of `apres nous le deluge'. I do not know what that really means in terms of the state of the economy which Labor administrations leave behind them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of the Treasury is another of the departments to which I referred in my earlier remarks when I said that the Department of Finance is one of the major coordinating departments and that one therefore would not normally expect to find much to criticise within at least the purely administrative functions of the Department because it does not have much in the way of clientele. Nevertheless, because of the very wide policy responsibilities that the Department of the Treasury enjoys, if that is the right word, I think it is necessary to spend a few minutes discussing its appropriations. To some degree we have been assisted in doing so by a rather important speech made not long ago by the recently appointed Secretary to the Treasury, Dr Higgins, who addressed the Consult Australia Annual Forum on 16 November last. His speech has been widely reported and I want to spend a few minutes to note certain aspects of it. In particular, I want to draw the Committee's attention to some comments by Dr Higgins on the difficulties from which the Australian economy has suffered on occasions in the past when we have entered into recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the time of the Committee to do this for the following reason: we in the Opposition are accustomed to Ministers suggesting that the recession, particularly that of 1982-83, was in some way the responsibility of a conservative administration, if one can describe Mr Fraser's administration as conservative. Of course, economists have always understood that that recession was a direct result of the wage explosion of 1981-82 which immediately preceded it and which virtually destroyed at one stroke the profitability of Australian enterprises, which produced a remarkable lift in business costs and therefore a remarkable decline in Australia's competitiveness in the external world and hence a large rise in the balance of payments deficit and so on. From time to time the Government is prone to suggest that somehow Australia's debt problems from which we are suffering so grievously today all began in 1982-83 as a result of the policies of the previous Government and because in 1981-82 and 1982-83 the balance of payments deficit was quite large-as it is now. Dr Higgins has performed a most useful service in setting the record straight on this matter. On page 9 of the printed text of his address he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Both of Australia's two previous recessions in my generation, in the mid-1970s-</PARA>
<PARA>and I have not taken the time of the Committee to talk about that one-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear the Minister interject along those lines because I rather expected that he would. Let us be quite clear as to the origins of the wage explosion that we are talking about. The origin was to be found in the fact that in or about July 1981 the then Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, now the Industrial Relations Commission, decided to abandon any further attempt to maintain a centralised wage system. It did that in the light of the total disregard of its decisions by a number of key unions-in particular, the Federated Storemen and Packers Union, which is Mr Simon Crean's union, I remind the chamber, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and a number of others. At that time the Commission was led to the view that it simply had to wash its hands of the whole performance, which had been reduced to the level of farce. Following that we had a carefully orchestrated campaign by the trade union movement in this country. It was orchestrated by two very prominent officials in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) today-namely, the President, as I think he still is formally, Simon Crean--</PARA></TALK.START>

Nevertheless, he is still formally a member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, I think. Another person involved was Mr George Campbell, the Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the union. As a result of this we had a massive wage breakout, carefully orchestrated by the trade union movement in this country. In the aftermath of that we had the major recession to which Dr Higgins refers. Let me continue quoting Dr Higgins's address. He goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>These wage explosions set inflation alight, eroded business profitability and competitiveness and greatly weakened private sector confidence. `Hard landings' were the inevitable result. </PARA>
<PARA>A sentence or two later he goes on to raise a point to which Government Ministers invariably fail to advert when they reflect upon that episode in our economic history. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the disturbances in the world economy that occurred in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s-which exacerbated our home grown difficulties-are not a feature of the present scene. </PARA>
<PARA>That leads him into another line of discourse. It is very valuable to have the new Secretary to the Treasury put so clearly on the public record a total refutation of everything this Government has ever said about the origins of the 1982-83 recession. It is very valuable and I acknowledge the truth of what Dr Higgins has said. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), by way of his earlier interjection, tried to suggest that some of that wage explosion in 1982-83 was due to the fact that we did not have a centralised wage system operating at that time. I take his interjection to be directed to the view that if only the accord, or something like it, had been operating at that time, things would have been different. It cannot be denied that things would have been different, but it can certainly be denied that things would have been better in any continuing sense. As more and more people are coming to accept, the accord has failed; it has simply taken longer for people in this country to understand the nature and the extent of its failure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia recently published a striking article on that subject in its recent Bulletin. The article is headed `The Accord-Success or Failure?'. In an extensive and very well-researched article, the Business Council of Australia finally comes down in favour of the view-which has been advanced for some time by others, including not least the Federal Opposition-that the accord has been a failure. It is true that it has produced in the past 6 1/2 years a fall of 14 per cent in real unit labour costs in this country. Of course, what is not revealed by the rather glib phrase which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other Ministers trip off their tongues is that it has come about through continuing inflation at rates which, roughly speaking, have been double those of the average of our trading partners and much more than double those of our most significant trading partners such as Japan. The fall has been brought about also by a significant depreciation in the value of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that we have retained competitiveness at all, it has been because the real value of money wage increases has been continually depreciated by inflation running faster than those money wage increases. That is supposed to be an achievement of the accord! I am very surprised to find the Government claiming it to be an achievement. Further, because those nominal wage increases have been running so fast compared to those in the countries with which we trade, over the period of this Government we have had a significant depreciation in the value of the Australian dollar. At the moment, as we all know, the value of the Australian dollar is being held temporarily appreciably higher than it was some time back because of the effect of the very high interest rates which the Government has put in place on demand for Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the claim that the accord has in some way been a success in rendering Australia more competitive is a claim which, when examined, as the Business Council did in the article to which I referred, can be seen to be a fraud and a sham. The only reason we have arrived at the outcome of a fall in real unit labour costs is basically that inflation has been running harder even than the quite large rises in nominal wage rates and we have had a significant depreciation in the value of our currency vis-a-vis the rest of the world during the time in question. Of course, what the proponents or advocates of the accord always fail to point out, because this is the other side, is that the clear cost, as distinct from those unclear costs which the Government claims to be benefits and which I have just been talking about, is that the accord has resulted in putting the Australian Council of Trade Unions in the box seat of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has also resulted in our having during the life of the present Government-particularly if one leaves out the first couple of years when there was a rebound effect from the depressed drought-affected and recession-affected situation, but even if one includes that rebound effect from the initial point at which the Government took office-an appalling productivity performance in this country, even worse than what I would regard as the rather poor productivity performance of the Government which preceded this Government. If anybody can derive for all of that a success for the accord, I would be very surprised. It is time that the Government stopped talking about the success of the accord and began facing up to the fact that the accord has been a failure. We will have to have a totally different system of industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will also need a totally different structure of the trade union movement to go with that changed industrial relations system. The strange thing is that the Government, rather surreptitiously, has begun to concede that fact. We had last week in Tokyo the extraordinary sound of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) telling Japanese businessmen and Japanese journalists in a press conference from which Australian journalists were apparently excluded that the Government is proposing-if it should be re-elected which we do not for a moment expect it will be; nevertheless I understand that the Treasurer, naturally enough, must tell those things to Japanese businessmen-to transform totally the trade union scene in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer told the Japanese businessmen that under a future Labor Administration we would have trade unions like the Japanese ones. I can understand why, in those circumstances, he has not been allowing Australian journalists to attend the press conferences. He would not like a good many of our trade unionists to hear him saying so; they might not altogether agree with that kind of formulation. Indeed, there are some signs already in New South Wales of divisions within the left wing of the ranks of our trade union movement on what is already known about developments in this area, let alone about what the Treasurer is beginning to say surreptitiously in Tokyo. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to ask myself why it is that Mr Keating is running around foreign parts saying things like this at press conferences from which Australian journalists are excluded. I suppose that one reason might be seen in the sorts of stories appearing on the front pages of one or two of our newspapers this morning. One such story points out that the degree of Japanese ownership in this country in the next four or five years is likely to increase astronomically. Again, that is not something which this Government wants to tell the Australian people. In saying that, I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not want to be understood to be saying that there is some specific objection to Japanese ownership as such, although if one is realistic one has to note that in many parts of the community, rightly or wrongly, that view is held. One has to note that, otherwise one is hiding one's head in the sand; but that is not my point. My point is that because of the economic policies of the Government, presided over by the Treasurer and his Department, the Treasury, whose appropriations we are discussing, we face the situation where this year, because of a balance of payments deficit, resulting from these policies, of about $20 billion, we will either have to borrow that sum or sell off Australian assets in that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is very concerned about what will occur in the next few months. As we all know, in the next few months there will almost certainly be a Federal election campaign. The Treasurer, for purely domestic political reasons, wants our domestic interest rates to fall. After all, elections will shortly be held in South Australia and Queensland. The electors, to some extent at least, are being reminded that if they intend to vote for Labor in those States, the problems from which those States are suffering at present, in relation to, say, housing loan interest rates or small business overdraft rates of between 23 and 25 per cent, derive from the policies of Labor's Federal counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is quite concerned about that matter. More importantly, of course, he is concerned about being able to get interest rates down between now and the Federal election. For example, he may tell the Reserve Bank to bring interest rates down. It should be remembered that the Treasurer is the man who, six months or so ago, said, in referring to the Reserve Bank, `It does as I say'. Those were his words. Perish the thought that there should be any sense of independence on the part of the Reserve Bank Governor, Board or the institution as a whole. The Treasurer is concerned that if he tells the Reserve Bank what to do, as he is accustomed to doing, it carries out his instructions-as he would certainly expect it to do-and interest rates start to come down, under those circumstances much of the present flood, or at least a very large volume, of hot money which is presently holding up our foreign exchange markets in this country, will go away. We will see what we might almost call a speculative run against the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the Treasurer is in Tokyo pleading with Japanese financiers not to desert him or his Government at this moment as, after all, it has been so good to foreign investors for so long. It has allowed them to come into this country and buy assets at depreciated rates. Let us be quite clear about this point: when the value of the Australian dollar falls, the price of Australian assets to foreigners diminishes. We have seen a fair bit of that already. Of course, we will see a lot more. That is why the Treasurer is in Tokyo pleading with Japanese financiers and that is why he has now gone to London to plead with British financiers and, no doubt, with a few European financiers as well-and I do not know whether he proposes to visit the United States-not to desert the Labor Party at this time. He is saying to them, `If you just hang in there long enough, our assets will be cheaper still and you will be able to buy even more of them with your yen, pounds, deutschmarks, or whatever'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see any answers-including in the speech by Dr Higgins to which I referred in my earlier remarks-or any sign of hope being held out to the Australian people that that will stop. There is no suggestion in Dr Higgins's paper that somehow the Government, or the Treasury operating under the Government, has a recipe for dealing with the problems of the country. On the contrary, the Government in its own Budget this year estimated that our balance of payments deficit this year will be $18.5 billion. That estimate has already been blown out of the water. We have had a deficit of just over $6 billion in the first three months. Another figure will be released tomorrow, and we will know a bit more about it then. It is fairly clear that unless there is a major crash coming-and the Government says that there is not-the balance of payments deficit will be higher than $18.5 billion-perhaps between $20 billion and $22 billion this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seems prepared to sit back and accept that that is happening and accept that the direct consequence is a continuing rise in the level of our foreign debt and/or a continuing rise in the level of foreign ownership of Australian assets. It says that basically nobody should be too concerned about that. That seems to be the Government's view-that it is all to do with the activities of a few entrepreneurs who have been borrowing overseas. I do not think that that is really good enough. I wonder whether the Minister would like to respond to the remarks that I have made. </PARA>

Let me proceed now on the undertaking that we will get the answer as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> English as a second language (ESL) education programs are acknowledged on all sides of this chamber as important to those whose mother tongue is not English. There is a requirement for families who have recently immigrated to Australia to gain quickly a sound competence in English. We need to have in place appropriate methods for teaching English as a second language to children and adults. ESL programs were savagely cut by the Hawke Labor Government in the 1986 Budget. There was a drop from $83m to $60m in the moneys that were passed on to the States. In fact, the Budget announcement was twice as drastic as that, but the protests around Australia and in this chamber were sufficient to ensure that various moneys were found in unallocated amounts in the education area to help the States make up the shortfall. But even with that scrabbling together of moneys to save the situation a little, funding was cut from $83m in 1986 to $59m in 1987. I have asked whether the peak funding for ESL in 1986 has yet been regained. The answer that I received recently is that it has not. In 1988 funding got back to $80m, and in 1989 it was $84.5m. So in real terms there is considerably less Commonwealth assistance available for ESL programs around Australia than there was in the peak year of 1986, yet the Government and Minister Dawkins have tried to put it about that they are particularly concerned to make sure that Australia's language resources are well provided for by an enlightened languages program. </PARA>
<PARA> A major inquiry was carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts into Australia's national language policy. It produced a report as thorough and as sound as any that this chamber has received. The Government has considered that report-in particular through the work of an officer, Mr Joe Lo Bianco-and has, at least in principle, accepted the Senate's recommendations in all areas. That is in regard to not only English as a second language but also Aboriginal languages and all manner of community languages in the various States, and languages that are taught for business and scholarly reasons. However, the Government is unable to demonstrate that it is maintaining even the ESL program in real terms, and it is failing to give adequate financial assistance to the implementation of the national language policy. That is a serious weakness in this Government's performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy is well understood. The Government says that it gives assent to that policy. We have heard a number of outstanding speeches, even by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, about the need for the language resources of this country to be improved, with regard to familiarity and competence not only in Asian languages but in all languages that are taught at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels in this country, particularly for applied business purposes. I do not wish this Committee to overlook the fact that we have a continuing problem with this Government: its performance does not live up to its rhetoric. I am still looking for some runs on the board, some actual performance flowing from the implementation of the national language policy, from adequate provision for English as a second language programs, from the implementation of the findings of the Asian Studies Council and the Language Policy Advisory Council, and from Ministers taking note of the fact that there is not sufficient substance in the Government's financial commitment to resources to live up to the high aspirations that have been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I refer to is the effect on postgraduate students in our higher educational institutions of the higher education contribution scheme, widely known as the graduate tax. The Hawke Labor Government introduced a new requirement for Australian students to contribute $1,800 on a deferred tax liability basis for one year's study in a higher educational institution. That tuition fee falls on undergraduate and postgraduate students alike, except for some 15,000 exemptions. There are about 300,000 students, so it is a very small minority that is exempt from the graduate tax. I have before me, provided in answer to a question that I asked in Estimates Committee C, a table setting out the exemptions with regard to the graduate tax applying to various postgraduate students. The total number of postgraduate students who are exempt is only 14,299, compared to 63,086 students actually enrolled as postgraduate students. It is an expressed concern by higher education institutions, by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and, indeed, by the students themselves that students need to be relieved of this penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to this point, the Government has deferred any real decision on the matter by saying that the full evaluation of the graduate tax scheme will not be in the Government's hands until next February. There is a study being undertaken with regard to the experience through the 1989 year, and I understand that the thoroughness of that complete study will be sufficient for policy decisions to be made and adjustments to the scheme implemented. I want to lament on behalf of higher education institutions and students that this has been far too slow a way to respond to the actual burden that postgraduate students have felt because of the graduate tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the solution is going to be the election of a coalition government so that the policy can be implemented whereby a quarter of all students will be exempt from any tuition fees, whether of the deferred kind or of the up-front payment kind. The Liberal and National parties have adopted a policy that the graduate tax system will be abolished completely and that in its place students-that is, only three-quarters of the students-will be required to make a payment that amounts to only two-thirds of the amount that the Labor Government is requiring of them. But the particular genius that relates to postgraduate students in the Liberal-National Party policy is that a quarter of all students will be entirely exempt and the decisions as to which particular students will be exempt will lie in the hands of the institutions themselves. So a quarter of all students in any university, institute of technology or college of advanced education will be exempt on the basis of decisions made by that institution itself. It is entirely competent for a university or college to say that all honours year and postgraduate students will be exempt from the already reduced coalition requirement for making a student contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that there is real tension in the present system with regard to postgraduate students-and, indeed, some other groups of students-and that there does need to be relief. Certainly, if we sit next year in February, March and April, those of us on the coalition side of the Senate will be very vigilant as to what the Government will be doing to make adjustments to ensure that the burden on postgraduate students is not excessive. If there is no decision, if only the status quo continues in those months, then it will be clear that the only relief in this matter, as in a wide number of areas in education, will be the election of a coalition government and the quite comprehensively different approach which will lead to less burden on students following the election of a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter that I wish to refer to, and perhaps one of my colleagues will intervene so that I can speak for a few minutes longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final matter I wish to refer to is the amount of money in recurrent grants paid to all higher education institutions expressed in terms of the amount of money per equivalent full time student unit (EFTSU). It is well understood that our higher education institutions enrol many full time students, a lesser number of part time students and even some external students. But if the proportion of a year's work that is appropriate for each enrolment is added up in terms of what those student numbers would be were there to be equivalent full time students, we can get a genuine measure of the actual total effect of enrolments in any one institution and, when the recurrent grant of money from the Commonwealth to a particular university or college is divided into the number of equivalent full time students, we have a standard rate that can be understood in any one year or in any particular institution. So the funding per EFTSU is a well-understood standard measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question in the Estimates Committee last month, to which I have only just received the answer, set out what that operating fund per EFTSU has been in recent years. In 1983, the figure was $9,320 per equivalent full time student unit. In the second year of the Hawke Labor Government, that amount fell in real terms to $9,180. All these figures I am discussing now are expressed in December 1988 prices, so they are expressed in real terms. Therefore, there is an ability for us to compare purchasing power, or the actual facilities or services that can be given to students with this money. So in the first year of the Hawke Labor Government the figure was at its peak of $9,320. In the second year, it fell to $9,180; in the third year, it fell to $9,160; in the fourth year, 1986, it fell to $9,000; in the fifth year, 1987, it fell to $8,850; in the sixth year, 1988, it fell again, to $8,520; and this year, it fell to $8,430. So in every year of the Hawke Labor Government the amount of money per student in higher education has fallen. It has constantly fallen; there have not been any exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time, I think, that this table has been made public. I wanted to highlight it because in many ways higher education institutions have brought to my attention the fact that they are feeling more and more squeezed because they have to do more and more with less and less money. The Government has camouflaged the fact that there has been a massive unmet demand during all of those years. Students have been turned away from our higher education institutions. Those students had the qualifications to enrol but places did not exist for them. Because of that enormous pressure, a large priority in the last six or seven years has been trying to meet that unmet demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I must note, favourably, that the Government has increased the number of students who can be enrolled in our higher education institutions. Let me quickly add that the coalition fully supports the increase in numbers and has made it clear that during the present triennium-1989-1990-1991-it will at least match the funding currently provided in the triennial plan. Recently the 1992 year was added and a financial commitment was given for a rolling triennium to the 1992 year. Recently the coalition, in its tax and expenditure policy statement, committed itself to at least the level of funding that the Government has indicated for the 1992 year. Students and staff involved in higher education know that, whether the present Government or, more likely, a coalition government is in power next year, the same number of funded places will be provided; so that is not a matter of contention. However, the record that is clearly before us is of falling dollars per student in every year of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to note one more matter before I finish. The coalition's policy is not limited to providing for those funded places. As I have outlined before, one-quarter of those funded places will be completely exempt from the payment of any tuition fee. Not only will those students be exempted from the payment of the graduate tax, but also the other three-quarters of the students will face the much lower burden that the coalition will be introducing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another innovation which is significant with regard to unmet demand is that the coalition will allow all of our higher education institutions to enrol, beyond those funded places, any number of students on whatever basis the institutions think fit. Overseas students can come to this country to gain higher education-and there is no ceiling on numbers because it is required that the places provided for overseas students be fully funded by those students. The fees paid by overseas students under this program must cover all of the costs of their enrolment. So there is a marketplace, if you like, for anyone who lives outside Australia to go to any Australian higher education institution and say, `I have the qualifications to enrol for this course, this degree, or this postgraduate study, and I have the money to pay for it. Tell me the fee and I can enrol'. So everybody is happy. But an Australian citizen or resident cannot do that. The answer given to a student who goes to the university or college of his choice is, `Yes, we acknowledge that you have the qualifications and we acknowledge that you are prepared to pay; but, sorry, the Hawke Labor Government has said that there is a ceiling, a limit, on the number of places in higher education institutions and that limit is determined only by what the Budget can allow in terms of fully funded places'. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition wants to open that door and provide an opportunity that will really test unmet demand in this country so that everyone can be told. `If you are in the first 400,000 students'-both school leavers and mature age students-`and if, on academic merit alone, you win one of the places that are fully funded by the Commonwealth, good luck to you, you have full admission and the cost will be either zero, if you are in the quarter of students who are exempt from paying fees, or an amount that is lower than the graduate tax for the other three-quarters. In addition, if you do not fall into one of those categories, you can still enrol and pay your way'. The Commonwealth Government would not be involved in determining the rules or the level of fees. Let the institutions enrol students on whatever grounds they wish and on whatever basis they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers that are before this Committee that were given to questions put to the Department of Employment, Education and Training in these matters make it abundantly clear that there are still significant failures under the Labor Government which will be remedied only when there is a change of government next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would welcome any response that the Minister wishes to give to these several matters I have raised. I would take his silence to mean that the country can continue to lament the state of higher education in these respects and others until there is a change of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I want to make some comments and then ask a few questions in the area of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Because we will have some critical questions and comments to make as we go along, I preface my remarks by saying that, in my view and in my experience in Estimates committees over the years, the performance of the officials in the immigration and ethnic affairs area particularly, which is the area about which I wish to speak today, has been excellent and I congratulate those officials. Despite the fact that there was some initial debate about the quality of the explanatory notes and some errors that had occurred in the preparation of the explanatory notes this year, there appear to have been valid reasons for the problems experienced this year. The Minister-and Mr Harris-in his comments assured us that it was a one-off problem and that next year we would look for a faultless performance. I think that Estimates Committee E noted that and, despite the problems with the explanatory notes this year, they were not of a major nature and I congratulate the Department on the explanatory notes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see that the Minister is now coming into the chamber and I wish publicly to thank him for the way in which he allowed the debate and the questioning on his Department's estimates in particular-and the other departments where he was involved as well-to proceed. This was very helpful to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the comments that I want to make follow up some of the points made in the course of the Estimates Committee debate. Some of those matters were issues that remained unresolved in the sense that there was work going on at the time in relation to them and other issues were ones where, for a variety of reasons, the Minister or his officials did not reply. I must say that in that latter context I was surprised that the Minister was not prepared to advise me as to the names of the members of the Multicultural Affairs Advisory Board who were not yet Australian citizens. He did admit that the question of Australian citizenship is a matter of public record. I must say that I could not quite understand-and I still do not-the Minister's sensitivity about refusing to answer that question. He may wish to comment on that later on. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister in relation to the regulations to accompany the new Act, which, as I understand it, are to be proclaimed by 19 December. There are many changes involved in the whole of the migration arrangements, programs and policy, particularly with the introduction of the floating mark for the first time in our history. I know there is a great deal of work involved in that. Over the last couple of days there have been reports, including press reports, that problems are being encountered in the drafting of those regulations. I would find it helpful if the Minister could tell us just where we stand at the moment in terms of the drafting of those regulations. Perhaps I will allow him to do that at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the first question, it is true that when one becomes an Australian citizen, it is on the public record, but what we do not do is publish names of people who are not Australian citizens. When a person becomes an elector, that is on the public record. I do not publish a list of names of persons who are not on the electoral roll. The Privacy Act is a lot different now because there are more constraints placed on us than two years ago when a previous question was answered along those lines. Like an umpire who is involved in an lbw decision, I erred in favour of the client on this occasion. I do not think that I have anything in particular to hide in this regard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You still feel that way, do you? Do you still stick with that approach? In other words, you still won't announce it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. The second more general question regards the regulations. I am somewhat constrained in what I can say about this because the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations is looking at it over this period, although not in an official way today, because last night the honourable senator's Party refused the Committee permission to meet today and tomorrow. The general philosophy was to have immigration criteria become law. Rather than as a policy directive from Ministers that can change from day to day with no supervision from Parliament, it was decided to transcribe all those entry criteria and other technical matters into regulations that will have the force of law. It was decided not to put them in legislation, and I think those involved in the process of reviewing the regulations now can see that that was a correct process, because it is much easier to change a regulation if it is found to be flawed than it is to change legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of discussions we agreed on a timetable to get these regulations ready. Indeed, one of the timetables placed on us was by this Senate via Senator Macklin's motion in that the latest point in which we could proclaim this new legislation was 19 December. I would have to say that this put an enormous amount of pressure on the drafting process by the time the instructions were drawn up and the first drafts done. But we managed to meet at least the timetable set, and since 31 October the Joint Select Committee has been examining the regulations in detail and, I understand, having preliminary discussions as to issues before it, looking at instructions, et cetera. The Committee has been working very hard on those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The following process is likely to occur: that Committee was obliged to report to me on 21 November, which was yesterday. It found that process too difficult and I said that it could certainly have another couple of weeks. At the latest I will receive its observations on 2 December. Between 2 December and 10 December I will be amending some regulations in accordance with the recommendations of that Committee. That is the latest I can take it to the printer. On 19 December I will also be indicating that other observations made by that Committee will see changes in the regulations probably in February, and I will also indicate what regulations I will not change. </PARA>
<PARA> The process then is that the Committee will report to the Parliament, and I would think at some stage we would then have to have a formal response to that Committee. However, I am making it very, very clear to everyone that there is no great proprietary interest in a particular way a regulation is drawn up and that we will be flexible in terms of responding to whatever difficulties crop up. I have to stress that this is a very major exercise. There will be flaws there; flaws that I or my Department have not picked up. Even the honoured Committee looking at it now will probably miss some. Therefore, governments have to remain flexible to change the regulations to suit. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say one other thing: day by day this move has proved to be absolutely essential because of court interference in immigration areas based on an archaic and outdated Act and, if the current situation that both governments have let go over the last 30 years were to continue, there would be an unworkable immigration system; a system that is run by the courts. That has never been the intention of the Australian people or this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a general summary of where we are heading with the regulations. Again I stress that the key date is when the Committee reports to me with its observations; the next key date is when I gazette the regulations; the next key date is when the Committee actually reports to this Parliament; and the next key date is when I respond to that report. I wish to put on record my absolute admiration for those members of the Committee who have gone through regulations that are four, five or even more inches thick. They are very complex. Plain English and the courts unfortunately still do not mix and we have to nail down absolutely everything. The members of the Committee have shown dedication over and above the normal dedication that is expected of them to plough through those regulations. They are under enormous time constraints to get their remarks to me so that we can react accordingly. Overall it has not been a bad process, considering where we may have been last May with a total stand-off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has to be distinguished between are procedures and policy. The policy was announced last December and it has been fairly widely disseminated. It is that which I am more anxious to get out to the general clientele, although these days immigration tends to be something that one does not have to go out and sell; it is something that people make intensive inquiries about. The $5 package available at our embassies and consulates throughout the world contains all the necessary information on entry criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will also be producing two major manuals for the use of our own officers, and no doubt they will be widely used by a lot of other people in the community. I do not plan a specific publicity campaign-that is, a paid publicity campaign-surrounding these matters. For a start, some of them are too complex but also I have found, at least in immigration matters, that word of mouth gets the message as to what is contained in the rules and regulations around very quickly. However, I think it is also true to state that, given the complexity of those rules and regulations, some of the advisory groups around the country will find increased pressure applied to them. I am talking about grant-in-aid workers, migrant resource centres, migrant workers rights offices and the other community organisations which will be expected to provide a lot of advice, as will our regional offices in Melbourne and Sydney and our central offices in the other States. However, I do not see a role for a sort of classic government advertising campaign in this regard, because the actual policy has been on the record for almost 12 months, and I think it is reasonably well understood by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific manuals to assist officers and others have been developed in a fairly competent way. One is called the care aggregate module and the other is the standard aggregate module. I think it will be necessary to make sure that early in the new year we conduct major seminars for electorate staff to bring them all into gear on the new changes. We need those sorts of things, but I do not think we need television or newspaper advertising at this stage. Over the next few weeks I think it will be necessary for a couple of press announcements by me. It would be unfair to any illegal immigrants to this country-even though they do not have any rights-to not tell them of these changes; it would be far better to tell them to try to regularise their status now, or before the nineteenth, than to leave it until after that date, because after the nineteenth mandatory deportation will apply. So, if people have strong reasons for believing that they could be allowed to stay here, for goodness sake, they should try to regularise their status now. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope those sorts of announcements will convey to the public as much as possible about those sorts of details. Of course, such things do not always get coverage; but I am sure honourable senators would have already seen the appearance in newspapers of advertisements by immigration solicitors pointing out this very fact. All right, I suppose they are after a buck, but they are also letting people know that the rules for illegal immigrants following 19 December will be much, much tougher, much less discretionary and much more likely to cause someone to have to leave this country than the laws of the previous Immigration Act. </PARA>

By the way, we are not bound to advertise that fact, but we are also not trying to cover it up.

I draw attention to the fact that the Committee met quite a few weeks ago and the matter has probably progressed since then. At that stage-I think it was on 28 September-Estimates Committee E was told that the foreign pilots who were coming to Australia under temporary permits were to use the Victorian State director as the contact point for facilitating rapid entry under those permits. In view of the considerable expressions of concern that have been voiced in the weeks since this issue was discussed in the Estimates Committee hearing, including of course the establishment by the Senate of a select committee on air safety, have any changes been made in terms of the processing and handling of foreign pilot entry permits? In other words, has any account been taken of the concerns that have been expressed about the safety issue? I refer in particular to the allegations that have been made that at least some of the foreign pilots have little proficiency in English and are having difficulty understanding the navigational and air traffic instructions and directions, et cetera.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the premise on which the honourable senator asked the question, even though he qualified it by saying, `it is being said'. I do not think it necessarily follows that it is the job of immigration officers to determine the competency of pilots. I do not mean that that is not our job, but a variety of Civil Aviation Authority criteria determine that matter. As the honourable senator says, a parliamentary committee is now inquiring into those matters. From an immigration point of view, we have to be satisfied as to the general qualifications of a pilot. I do not think the honourable senator would suggest that we should decide whether or not pilots are competent to fly in Australia. The point is that if anyone is to receive a temporary entry permit to work in Australia but cannot obtain work, I suggest that he will not stay here for very long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard allegations from both sides of the quality of overseas pilots who have come here to work. I will be interested to hear what the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations says. From my point of view, I cannot make a judgment on the matter. I have not seen any evidence produced at Estimates Committee B or anywhere else in this chamber to suggest that any of these pilots are incompetent. I have not heard one shred of evidence to cause me concern in this regard. I cannot say without reservation that every pilot coming here is perfect, just as I cannot say that every doctor we bring into the country is perfect. I do not expect my overseas officers to evaluate the competency of pilots, just as they do not undertake such an evaluation in relation to doctors or any other profession. Obviously, before those professionals come to this country, they must be qualified. I am not aware of any changes having been made since 28 September. I cannot assure the honourable senator that none has been made, but at this stage none has been brought to my attention. My departmental officers will be happy to assist the Senate Select Committee at any time in relation to any of these matters. </PARA>

By the time the pilot disengaged the computer, it was too late and I believe that 90 lives were lost. That person is now flying an Australian registered plane.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that that job would be impossible. One cannot really turn overseas immigration officers, who are the initial contact point, into aviation experts. That is why we have the Civil Aviation Authority. That person could not fly in Australia unless the Civil Aviation Authority deemed him to be a competent pilot. I am familiar with the air crash to which the honourable senator refers; it occurred at the Paris Air Show, I think it was two years ago, and the accident was televised. I am not aware of the full circumstances or for how long the licence was suspended, but the pilot's competency to fly in Australia in not an immigration matter. If such people enter Australia under temporary permits and are not permitted to fly here, then they would go somewhere else in the world. Our job has been-and we are entitled to do this-to bring pilots into this country because there is an occupational shortage in that area. Job vacancies must be filled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation might have been different if the pilots had gone on strike rather than resigning. We might have had a different approach. However, they did resign and 1,200 airline jobs had to be filled, some of them from overseas. It is not unusual to fill skill gaps from overseas; we do that all the time. This situation is no different from any other case. The matters the honourable senator raises really relate to the Civil Aviation Authority; they are not immigration matters. </PARA>

I am not suggesting that everyone on all sides of the argument is blameless: many assertions have been made in this dispute but not much evidence has been produced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Civil Aviation Authority is not really involved in the process at that stage; rather, it becomes involved at a later stage. It really involves the employer, who comes to us and says that it has recruited a certain pilot who is suitable and properly qualified to come to Australia. That pilot is then given a temporary entry permit and comes to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, before the pilot flies he must be certified as to his competency to fly. It is not really a matter of our relationship with the Civil Aviation Authority. We would have a concern only if the employers approached us and obtained temporary entry permits for people who were not able to fly in this country. Obviously, that would breach the spirit of our immigration laws, because those people who were brought into this country on the basis of their supposed ability and competency to fly could not do so. That would be our interest in the matter, but again it is up to the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that an employer would try to employ someone to fly in Australia if he could not speak English and, if it did, the Civil Aviation Authority would not certify the pilot as being competent to fly. It is really a matter of the employer's relationship with my Department. The same situation would occur if a hospital wanted to employ a certain doctor in the western suburbs because of a shortage of doctors. The hospital would come to us and say, `There is a shortage. We have advertised the position but cannot fill it, so on either a temporary entry or migrant basis we want to bring in Dr X'. We would then allow Dr X to enter the country, but his competency within Australia would be determined by a fairly complex procedure involving the Australian Medical Association and other organisations. </PARA>

It seems to me that, as a matter of principle, it would make more sense to know before a person is given a permit to stay in Australia for a period of between six and 12 months that the regulatory authorities in this country certify him to be competent for the purposes for which he is coming into the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not, but I have no reason not to take that question on notice and write to the honourable senator as soon as the figures can be established. The figures will probably have to be in two categories: those who have been authorised for temporary entry permits (TEPs) and those who have actually arrived. Taking up Senator Short's other point, there is a difference between principles in migration and temporary entry in as much as I can cancel a temporary entry permit at any time. Therefore if someone who has come here does not qualify, it does not mean that that person can have a 10-month holiday on the beach on a TEP. I can cancel the permit at any time. I have not seen the figures as to how many pilots have been given TEPs. I assume they exist somewhere in my Department. I will ask the officers to get them to Senator Short as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray may have given a partial answer to my question in the hearing of the Estimates committee. It concerns the proposed revision of the Australian Citizenship Act. The Minister at least will be aware that I have made representations to him and to his predecessors over some years concerning an anomaly whereby the daughters and sons of certain Australian women who were married in a brief period before 1948 do not have Australian citizenship, whereas the children of Australian men who were married in the same period do have Australian citizenship. That is the essence of the problem. It arose because an attempt was made to correct a situation with some amending legislation recently which still excluded this small group of people against whom there has been discrimination on the grounds of their gender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have raised with the Minister the particular problem of Dr Geraldine Room who finds herself in this situation. Those of us who went through the University of Sydney will know that Professor Room, who was a professor of mathematics, fought in the Australian Imperial Force and married an Australian woman but was a British citizen. Geraldine was born during a brief period while they were out of Australia on sabbatical leave. Her birth was registered at an Australian consulate but, because she had not been born in Australia and because her mother was Australian but her father was not, she has now been informed that she is not an Australian citizen. Apparently this arises because of an anomaly in the Act. I suggested to the Minister that a small number of people must be caught by the anomaly. The Minister has indicated, I thought quite graciously, that he will try to have it included in a revision of the Citizenship Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem becomes more urgent because Dr Room is having a child and is keen to establish her Australian citizenship. At present she lives in England. I ask the Minister for some assessment of when this amendment will come to pass because I keep telling my constituents, in response to their representations, that we hope it will be soon. I understand the Minister says that he wants to get a comprehensive review of the Act under way and that this might be only one of a number of matters to be covered, but the question of timing does concern me. What information can the Minister give to the Committee that might assist me in giving further information to my constituents?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter has been raised by Senator Baume on a few occasions. I indicated to him last time that I thought that a more extensive review of the Australian Citizenship Act should be undertaken and it has been undertaken. I do not think that instructions have yet been given to the draftsman, but that is not unusual. We have until 10 February to do that. I expect that the legislation will come up in the autumn session. However, I cannot give Senator Baume any guarantees of passage because I do not know how many Bills will pass this chamber and I do not know when the election will be, which will obviously impact on any autumn sittings. So it may not come up until the spring session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I signed a letter to Senator Baume's colleague, Mr Ruddock, which is not in any sense a private letter. I was asked what we contemplated doing in this area. The first item listed happened to be Senator Baume's item. Maybe his colleague would like to share that letter with him when it arrives in a day or two. We indicate in that letter what we intend to do with regard to that and other matters relating to the Citizenship Act. It may be dealt with in the autumn session. That does not necessarily help the person involved. I am sure that if the Bill, when it comes up, does not cover it, I will be able to rely on Senator Baume for an ingenious amendment that will do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for some elaboration as to what may have happened since we considered these matters on 28 September regarding the changes that are being made to the special humanitarian program particularly in relation to the Lebanese. I understand that the changes that have been announced are about an extension of three months to six months under the relevant part of the process, that claims will be able to be processed in Australia and that there will be a slightly more relaxed attitude towards Lebanese changing status in Australia if they come from Beirut or fighting areas. That is the essence of the changes, as I understand them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as I understand it, stated just in advance of the decisions on the special humanitarian program changes being announced that another 1,000 places would be made available for Lebanese migrants. That is something that we would greatly welcome. We have all been very moved by the representations we have all had on both sides of the Parliament from Chouf Coast refugees. They are a slightly different kettle of fish from refugees from Beirut itself; nevertheless they are Lebanese with a very important cause. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, as I understand it, stated that he thought that another 1,000 places would be made available. When we debated this in the Estimates committee the Minister said that he was not confident that the changes would deliver 1,000 places and that the Government was never committed to doing so, but it was just to investigate the possibility. Can the Minister say anything further on this matter? Have there been any further developments since the end of September? I know that this is a matter of considerable concern and interest to the Lebanese community and it would be appreciated if the Minister could add anything. In particular, I am concerned that there may be confusion, particularly in the minds of those in the Lebanese community, as to whether there will really be 1,000 additional places. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly Senator Short has added to the confusion today. Let me put the record straight so that he can never again inadvertently misrepresent the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Prime Minister was asked a question in the House of Representatives. He very carefully replied that he had asked me to examine whether methods were available to us to increase the intake by up to 1,000 places. No-one ever said that there would be an extra 1,000 places. In all fairness to the Prime Minister and anyone else, no-one has ever said that. The Prime Minister asked whether we could look at ways of loosening the criteria to make up another 1,000 places. It is very unfair to the Prime Minister to claim that he said that there would be an extra 1,000 places. I have checked Hansard on previous occasions just to make sure that the point I have now made is accurate, and it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ironically, my biggest problem is that I do not think that this year 1,000 people will apply under the special humanitarian program, let alone qualify. I have serious doubts as to whether 1,000 people from Lebanon will even apply. Lebanon is really three zones at the moment: the north, which is very stable; the area around Beirut, which has been absolutely dreadful; and the south, which is very stable. Many of the representations Senator Short and I get are from people in the north and south who want to come to Australia even though there is no fighting at all in those zones. Of course, the fighting in Beirut has eased. One of the other things we have to take into account is that the population in Beirut has declined massively. I think it is 250,000. It will surprise Senator Short that some 12,000 Australian citizens live in Lebanon at the moment, mostly in Beirut. That figure of 12,000 has surprised me. I found it staggering but apparently it is correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are running businesses. Coming back to Senator Short's point, a new chief migration officer has gone to Damascus. He has not been there long, but he also is looking at the interpretation of the new guidelines. I think he will come back with some suggestions, based on his experience on the ground of how we can broaden this program. I would also like to stress that Lebanon is virtually the only country that has a special humanitarian program. Many other Australian citizens would like a similar program for their own home country, but I do not think it is possible to have a special humanitarian program for every potential country. There is no question that, given the 15 years of internecine warfare in Lebanon, this is a deserved program for Lebanon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have alluded to the major problem that worries me, and that is, in trying to help the extra people involved, whether enough will apply. It is still difficult to get to Damascus from Nicosia for interview. There are enormous communication difficulties within Lebanon for people here trying to get in touch with relatives there. We also have an enormous problem with forgeries in this area. Even though the special humanitarian program has tended to decline over the years in terms of numbers delivered, we should also look at the figures which show that Lebanon still remains in the top 10 source countries for Australian immigrants, especially in the preferential family area. Up to about 3,000 Lebanese a year come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short has asked me what changes have occurred since September. The program will at least treble over last year's figure, and that is at a minimum. Nevertheless, I would like to see it further expanded. I will be very interested to hear from, if you like, `my man in Damascus' as to how he thinks the program is operating, whether it needs to be modified further and whether the criteria need to be loosened. I can assure Senator Short that I will keep a weather eye on this matter on a daily basis, rather than reviewing it every couple of months, to make sure that it is working adequately. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short has referred to the sorts of representations made to him. I think we have all experienced those representations. It would be inhuman not to respond to them and not to feel an enormous tug when some of those stories are told. Many people are put through immense hardship. I hope that we can deliver 1,000 extra places this year in the program, but I cannot guarantee it. If people do not apply, they cannot come here. Honourable senators know of the Italian syndrome in regard to migration. The Italians complain that no-one comes, but no-one applies. When they do, their success rate is enormously high. We will just have to see how the situation develops. I will keep in contact with various Lebanese communities around Australia and hear their views. Later this afternoon some Lebanese will be involved in a tree planting at Parliament House. Many of their representatives will probably make points to Senator Short and me and others. Senator Short is looking blank; perhaps he has not been invited. I invite him to come out at 3.30 p.m. </PARA>

Just through the cable traffic I have noted that he will have some further suggestions to make. He is not doing an official inquiry into how it is going, so I would not like the Senate to be misled in any way. People living in either the north or the south are not disqualified under the criteria, but in one sense it is helpful to them if their residence has been destroyed. That is less likely to occur in places other than Beirut at the moment. That is the almost automatic accepter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the location of the migration office in Lebanon has been one of ongoing discussions for a long time. The move from Beirut to Damascus has been discussed. Some members of the Lebanese community have pushed for the Beirut office to be reopened. Obviously, at this stage there are good reasons why that would be difficult, but has the Minister or his Department looked at the possibility of having the migration office located somewhere in Lebanon, but outside Beirut? The reason I ask that question is obvious. The road to Damascus is a very difficult one physically; it is also very difficult for many Lebanese to bring themselves to travel to Damascus for a variety of reasons. I understand that the office was moved from Beirut purely for safety and security reasons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might surprise Senator Short when I say that I have not been put under much pressure to reopen a migration office in Beirut. Most representatives of the Lebanese community would like a symbolic representation by Foreign Affairs in Beirut. They no longer suggest a migration office there because it represents queues and danger. The real problem with moving the migration office anywhere else in Lebanon is whether it would be under Syrian or Israeli control. What is the justice in that? That is the difficulty. Many Lebanese say that they do not want the office under Syrian or Israeli control because to put it outside Beirut reflects on their sovereignty. To put it where foreign forces are involved would be an insult to Lebanon itself. I know that Senator Short did not mean that. He is just looking for a practical solution to the travel problems. He will find that many Lebanese in Australia are vehemently opposed to the migration office being set up in Tripoli or Sidon. I have not looked at it, but I would be happy to do so. However, those sorts of problems are insurmountable. We have made the Nicosia option as available as possible which helps at least those in certain parts of Beirut when the ferries are running.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can answer the questions that I have been asked concerning water research. In fact today I announced the allocation of $2.8m in water research grants under the Commonwealth's national water research program. That brings the Commonwealth's allocation in 1989-90 to $6.8m and expenditure in total since 1985-86 to $24m on water research in Australia. There have been a number of applications for these funds, which indicates a considerable interest in the research community for this type of activity. The quality of the applications has been very high and the funds have been allocated with a mind to providing for the most strategic projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The projects that I have approved cover a range of research areas including salinity and integrated catchment management, the treatment of waste water and changes in water allocation, and the social and regional implications of water allocation. One of the more novel projects approved involves an allocation of funds to the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia and the Royal Australian Ornithologists Union to investigate the suitability of wetland areas for waterbirds. The type of collaboration between that organisation and the Western Australian department is the sort of thing we are looking for in encouraging these sorts of allocations.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Childs also asked me about the COWSIP program, the country water supply improvement program. Earlier this month I announced grants to New South Wales and Western Australia under the COWSIP program totalling $7.2m. The New South Wales projects include provision of a reticulated supply at Tambar Springs, improved security of water at Mogo and White Cliffs, improved quality and security of supply at Binnaway and Werris Creek and improved supply at Morundah, Delungra and Bundarra. COWSIP projects for New South Wales this financial year in value amount to $1.54m, and eight projects under the COWSIP scheme have been funded this time out of the money I have allocated. A range of projects have been funded in Western Australia, including a new reticulation supply at Condingup and Yallingup, upgrading an existing scheme at Badgingarra, and improving the quality and quantity of supply at New Norcia. Western Australia has had 15 schemes funded under this project, the details of which I will release later today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Local Government. The Minister is most likely aware that the Municipal Association of Victoria (MAV) has lodged with the Federal Industrial Relations Commission an appeal against the decision to grant family day care providers award coverage. Given that the Minister has previously expressed the Government's concern over the likely cost ramifications of the decision and advised in the Senate on 6 October that the Commonwealth's position was that the carers were considered to be self-employed, can the Minister provide an assurance to councils in Victoria and Tasmania that the Federal Government will be represented at that appeal in order to assure that the Government's previously stated position is again made known? If fears of a union backlash prevent the Government from putting forward its views, is the Minister aware that the Government's absence is likely to be interpreted by the Industrial Relations Commission as support for the award decision and to place the Government, as sponsor of the family day care scheme, in a position where it is morally obliged to provide councils with the extra funding which they will require to meet wages costs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly aware that this is a matter of some considerable concern to the Municipal Association of Victoria, to those who work in the family day care industry, to the Government and to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I have said before in this place that late last year the Federated Municipal and Shire Employees Union of Australia notified a dispute with those local councils in Victoria and Tasmania which sponsor family day care schemes with a view to negotiating an award for carers. The Municipal Association of Victoria, acting on behalf of the councils of Victoria and Tasmania, has submitted an appeal against the decision based on the supposition that family day carers are self-employed as the contract for payment of child-care is between the parents and the care giver. Should the appeal by the MAV fail, the procedure by the union will be to negotiate the terms of an award, the likely content of which is as yet unknown. Until the determination of the award is known, the actual increase in the cost of providing family day care cannot be accurately assessed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Leader of the Government in the Senate see an article in the Australian Financial Review of 17 November 1989 on the sale by Mr Alan Bond of a French impressionist painting on which he realised a capital gain of $14m? How are capital gains on French impressionist paintings currently treated for tax purposes in Australia? How would they be treated under a speculative gains tax phasing out the tax liability over five years? Is it true that the replacement of the existing capital gains tax by a speculative gains tax would stimulate investment in Australia? If so, will the Government amend the tax regime accordingly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell interjects that the Government is getting desperate. I cannot think of anybody more desperate in this Parliament at present than members of the Queensland National Party. Any questions about gains of any kind, but particularly capital or speculative gains touch a raw nerve with Senator Boswell. After all, he has been up there with the paper bag merchants for years now, and they are about to get their comeuppance in the Queensland election. So, Senator Boswell would know all about governments being desperate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did see the article in the Australian Financial Review regarding the sale of Mr Bond's painting, which he acquired at Christie's in New York in 1983 for $5.07m and sold at Sotheby's in New York earlier this month for $19.05m, making a capital gain of $14m in six years. I suppose nobody begrudges Mr Bond his capital gain. Where a painting was owned by a taxpayer before the introduction of the capital gains tax, as is the case with this picture, La Promenade, the capital gain is not subject to capital gains tax because when the Government introduced the present capital gains tax it was introduced on a strictly non-retrospective basis. However, where a painting was acquired after 19 September 1985-that is the date for all intents and purposes of the introduction of the capital gains tax-at a consideration in excess of $100, that painting is listed as a personal use asset and subject to capital gains tax. The tax is levied on the gain, adjusted for inflation. If Mr Bond, or any other art collector, were to sell tomorrow a painting bought after that date and make $14m on it, such a French impressionist painting acquired in that period would be subject to capital gains tax. If the Opposition's proposed watering down of the capital gains tax were ever implemented, things would be a little different.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza interjects, a so-called speculative gains tax would apply. For example, if Mr Bond held his Manet for six years, which does not seem a very long time-in this present case he held it for six hours-under the Opposition proposal he would have to hold it for only five years before capital gains tax was nullified. So, a $14m capital gain on a work of art acquired in that period would be tax-free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Maguire asked the appropriate question as to whether the speculative gains tax and the abolition of the capital gains tax would affect investment decisions. Of course it would; it would provide an enormous incentive for wealthy people, the less than 2 per cent of Australians who pay capital gains tax, to invest in assets which yield no income whatsoever but which hold out the promise of good capital gains-that is, works of art, antiques, rare stamps and coins, real estate, and so on would not be subject to a capital gains tax.</PARA>

How many people got their fingers burnt in that little exercise in the late 1970s? What happened to all of that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the point I was making in respect of paintings and other such objects. Funds would be bitten away from investment in productive business assets. The business community knows this full well. Sensible business leaders are not too happy about this little suggestion which emanated from the bowels of the Liberal Party. That would mean less contribution to the supply of goods and services from either export or import replacement. The flow of income provided by those productive assets is taxed, and the assets depreciate ultimately to scrap value. Investors would prefer to forgo the income stream from a productive asset, under the proposal of the Liberal and National parties, for the untaxed capital gain on an unproductive asset. The Government does not intend to reintroduce that kind of distortion into the tax system. It would obviously be counterproductive to Australia's real investment needs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most people concerned with forestry these days, I place a high value on encouraging the growth of commercial plantations in Australia to take pressure off native forests. The Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands has announced the findings of a report entitled The Economics of Diversifying from Grazing to Pine. The thrust of that report is to recommend to the Government that it market commercially to farmers the prospect of growing pine trees on farmland as an alternative to grazing cattle and other agricultural uses of that land and thus propose to farmers a possibility of diversifying their agricultural cultivation and agricultural use of their land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recommendation, at which I have had a chance to look, is similar in type to the trees on farmland program organised in Western Australia by the Department of Conservation and Land Management in that State, which promotes hardwoods for farmers to grow on their land at a guaranteed buy-back rate from industry. It is also similar to a program announced recently by the South Australian Government, the trees for life program, which also proposes that farmers should investigate the commercial uses of this type of forestry and that there are financial benefits in it for them if they do so because of the resource needs of industry. My attitude to the Victorian proposal is to commend it and to recommend that other States look at the report and follow suit where possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the question Senator Zakharov asked me is about afforestation as well. On 10 November I announced grants totalling $6.5m under the national afforestation program, which is a program of the Hawke Government. It is provided to lend assistance to demonstrate the viability of plantations and to stimulate commercial investment in them. I am speaking here not about trees on farmland but about broad acre plantations and, of course, the more of that we can encourage the greater the easing of pressure on existing native forests.</PARA>
<PARA> My announcement on 10 November funded 28 existing projects and 22 new projects. It means that an additional 1,500 hectares of hardwood plantation is to be added to the existing 12,250 hectares already established. Since the introduction of the national afforestation program we have seen a more than doubling of the hardwood plantation establishment rate that existed prior to the NAP. Indeed, as a direct result of this Government's initiative through the NAP, the overall area of hardwood plantations has been increased by 20 per cent. One of the interesting projects that were funded under this allocation was a study of the establishment of rainforest species in agroforestry plantation systems by the Institute of Tropical Rainforest Studies in Cairns. The $6.5m that I announced is additional to the $3.9m announced by the Prime Minister in his environment statement.</PARA>
<PARA> I come to the final point of Senator Zakharov's question about plantation development generally. I can announce that I have set up a task force comprising Professor Lindsay Pryor, the world's foremost expert on eucalypts and who has had extensive experience in plantation development, and Dr Joe Landsberg, who was formerly chief of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Division of Forestry Research and who is an expert on both forestry and ecological management. That task force will work in the south-east forests of New South Wales with a view to testing the viability of a plantation strategy for that region. Its task is two-fold.

<PARA> This is the fourth study on the south-east forests of New South Wales that I have commissioned. The first was into the floral and faunal properties of the area. The second was into the establishment of a flitch mill and the prospects for better utilisation of the resource because of that. The third was into the better utilisation of small and round wood, that is, the scrap materials that are left, for forestry industry purposes. This plantation study comes on the heels of those studies. It means that we can position ourselves, when these studies are concluded and the results are implemented, to see whether we can add greater value to the forest products in that area and to ease the pressure on native forests in that region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little surprised to read this particular report which was brought to my attention this morning, because on Monday evening in Adelaide I had the opportunity to address a number of workers in community services and local government at a biannual conference. This issue was not raised at that conference, but nevertheless it is of concern to me and I have sought some information from my colleague Mr Peter Staples. The Government's commitment to the home and community care program is clearly demonstrated by the growth in funding for home and community care at a time of considerable budgetary restraint. In this year's Budget the Government has provided for 15 per cent growth in total Commonwealth home and community care funding. In addition, it has contributed a further $20m of Commonwealth only money, which has had the effect of increasing the total level of home and community care Commonwealth funds by almost 20 per cent over last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Victoria, the State Government, which is responsible for the actual administration of the program, made a decision to index the program by 12.3 per cent. Therefore, this reflects an increase in total Commonwealth-State funding of around about $12.7m. I understand from the Victorian Minister that this amount provides sufficient funds to meet the full year effect of decisions taken last year, as well as pre-existing commitments, including a level of cost supplementation to existing services. In relation to the specific area of local government participation in the home and community care program-and, of course, the Federal and State governments do rely a great deal on local government's involvement in a program of this kind-this financial year, there was a 25 per cent increase and the total expenditure is estimated at $53.8m.</PARA>

I am advised that the Australian patrol boat Wauri has investigated two incidents in which the Papua New Guinea licensed Taiwanese vessel Mao Hua was operating in waters adjacent to Bramble Cay. I understand that the vessel was operating in Papua New Guinea waters outside the Torres Strait protected zone, apparently in contravention of relevant Papua New Guinea legislation. Of course, this is a matter for the Papua New Guinea authorities. The Australian vessel Wauri has collected evidence which indicated that the vessel was operating in contravention of its Papua New Guinea licence, and this has now been passed on to the relevant authorities in Papua New Guinea. In addition, fisheries patrol officials have discussed the incidents with Papua New Guinea with a view to assisting in any future prosecution.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is all I want to say about that aspect of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the eligibility for special benefit by members of the Orionia community, it should be noted that two sets of cases are running before us. One is running in relation to applications for special benefit for some closed periods in the past, and those cases are being considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. In view of the fact that these matters are being properly heard by independent statutory administrative review bodies, it would not be appropriate either to comment on the issues involved or to make any estimation of what the people involved can expect from these two bodies.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Jenkins mentioned, there are some new claims for special benefit and those claims have been received from members of the Orionia community. I gather that they have been lodged with the Albany regional office of the Department of Social Security and I am informed that those applications are being processed in the normal way in accordance with the national guidelines issued for the administration of special benefit. The honourable senator also raised the question of access to medical benefits. The people involved here may in fact be eligible for health care cards which, broadly speaking, would give them access to health care benefits which are available to people on low incomes. They may be eligible and that has to be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem I have in giving the honourable senator a more definite answer about what may or may not happen in terms of the applications before the Government and the Department of Social Security by members of this community is that there are, as the honourable senator would understand, some quite stringent confidentiality provisions in the law which in fact safeguard the privacy of applicants. The assurance that I can give in the context of that is that these applications will be processed in the normal way according to the normal, nationally applicable guidelines and no discrimination will be offered one way or the other.</PARA>

The subject is not about lunatic ideas that may be current or not current on this matter. I asked specific questions about whether the Government had studied the existing child welfare laws and what its view was about their adequacy. Does it intend to legislate federally, with or without consultation with the States?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, it is a matter for Senator Tate, but at the moment the Government's judgment is that no Australian law is in contravention of the provisions of this particular convention. The utility of the convention is not in order to give the Government any additional legislative authority it may have lacked at the Federal level to do things which are not being done at the State level. Rather, the utility of it is as an international instrument reflecting an unequivocal international endorsement of some really quite fundamental and basic principles about respect for the position of children as individuals, which is manifestly not the case in a number of other cultures and countries. That is the reason for it, not in order to acquire authority to do all sorts of exotic things which, again, some lunatic fringe people seem to think are the Government's preoccupation and intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my belief that there is any intent at all within the Government to legislate federally on child welfare issues based on the authority that a treaty of this kind would give it, in which case I doubt that it is necessary to go through any extensive consultative process with the States. However, as a matter of course, there is such a process of consultation before treaties are formally ratified and I have no doubt that that process will be followed again in this instance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At various stages the legal advisers of Mr James Savage have applied for legal aid in relation to his trial in the State of Florida in the United States. In the first instance I decided that the Australian taxpayer should not support his application for legal aid in relation to the trial which, as to the verdict, concluded yesterday, 21 November, when he was convicted of first degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and sexual battery with great force with a deadly weapon. I decided that legal aid should not be made available at that stage because the Constitution of the United States provided for legal aid to be available to Mr Savage. Indeed, it was provided and I have been informed by consular officials and the Aboriginal Legal Aid representative, who is also in Florida, that the legal representation afforded to Mr Savage was very adequate indeed. They have no complaints about the adequacy of that legal representation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the sentencing process commences on 11 December 1989. Requests have been made for legal aid to assist expert witnesses to travel to the United States to give evidence in mitigation of sentence, evidence which no doubt would go to the question of the effect of the adoption procedures and the removal from family which faced many Aboriginal women and their children. Thank goodness, that happened at a time in our past, but it was recent enough to have the sorts of consequences that it is alleged have resulted in Mr Savage facing the most severe capital penalty, that is, the death sentence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `alleged'. Nevertheless, the fact is that when an Australian abroad is facing the death penalty, different considerations apply from those that apply to the actual proceedings by way of a trial of the facts. If there is a near analogy, it is the case of Barlow and Chambers in Malaysia, when some moneys were made available by way of financial assistance to those who were involved in the appeal process in regard to sentence. So at this stage I am looking at the matter sympathetically, and when Mr Savage's legal representatives make clear whom they wish to travel to the United States and precisely for what purpose and indicate clearly what expectations they might have of the part those persons could play in pleas for mitigation of sentence, I will give very sympathetic consideration to their request.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government-the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in particular-has claimed regularly that our high interest rates, which are the highest in the Western world and the highest in Australia's history, have been necessary to dampen demand. The Minister will be aware that in order to offset unacceptably high mortgage interest rates, following the lead of the Labor Premier in South Australia, which will hold its election this Saturday, the Leader of the Labor Party in Queensland has offered $35m cash to mortgagors to compensate home buyers for the Federal Government's monetary policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone, thank you for your help. I understand that in both States the election results are likely to be fairly close, so in those political circumstances this sort of offer will be made by State political parties. In so far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, our position on this matter is quite clear. As Senator Parer pointed out at the beginning of his question, monetary policy has been kept tight in order to reduce demand in the Australian economy and in order to have a consequent effect on the level of imports. Those statements have been made consistently by numerous Ministers and that is the position adopted by the Federal Government. As distinct from the contestants in the State political arena, no elector in the Commonwealth of Australia can hold out much hope for an early change to that policy, even if there were a change of government. Indeed, on the Opposition's policies as announced to date, if such a situation arose, there would be a further reliance on monetary policy and an increase in interest rates-there is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked a question about $35m being promised by the Labor Party in Queensland for mortgage interest rate relief. I do not know what figure was offered by the National Party of Australia, but I assume it is larger.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked a good question, as has been noted by the Opposition, because the question of airport security is of great concern to domestic and overseas passengers. That is why the Federal Government has moved to upgrade security arrangements at some 23 Australian airports and from January onwards the responsibility for that first anti-terrorist incident control will move progressively from the Australian Federal Police to the Australian Protective Service (APS). Indeed, the counter-terrorist presence will be enhanced at these airports and will be provided for the first time at some 13 other airports, including, as Senator Brian Archer will be interested to know, Launceston and Devonport, which, as a result of this decision, will receive the benefit of this enhanced security service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result, the Australian Federal Police will be able to focus on its primary role, which of course is to be the pre-eminent national criminal investigative body throughout the Commonwealth. I believe that we are now at the last stage of the major restructuring of the Australian Federal Police so as to enable it to concentrate, outside of its community policing responsibilities in Canberra, on that nation-wide role.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very confident that the Australian Protective Service will be able to provide that required security at airports. As honourable senators would know, there is no doubt that the security provided by the APS at Parliament House, selected embassies, consulates and defence establishments has proved to be excellent and I am sure that it is well within its charter, training and capacity to provide the same sort of security at our Australian airports. Some legislation will be required to give members of the Australian Protective Service certain limited powers in relation to their responsibilities, but I do not believe there is any question whatsoever of members of that service being vested with general police powers. I do not think that anyone would wish that to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA> Community policing functions at airports will continue to be the responsibility of the State and Territory police forces. Apart from the great majority of lost and found requests for assistance, very few such incidents occur. I believe that State and Territory police forces will be able to handle, as I say, the very few incidents relating to community policing functions without any great diversion of resources.</PARA>
<PARA> We have now reached the final stage in the restructuring of the Australian Federal Police, which this chamber has supported. I have been very grateful for that support.

It might be better for the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to go back to work rather than cause the disruption which it has caused in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that the ILO will deal with this matter in line with its usual procedures. The Australian Government is preparing a response to these complaints. I would not want to respond prematurely or through unofficial channels to the specific complaint. I simply reiterate that the Government strongly supports freedom of association. We reiterated this point in our submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission during the hearing on this dispute on 28 September 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no change to the status of the AFAP as a federally registered union, as there was to the Builders Labourers Federation, for example, or to the availability of the rights, privileges and protection of the Federal system. It is the Federation of Air Pilots which has consistently refused to follow the processes or meet the obligations of that system. It has been given several opportunities to proceed with its claim within the system and has refused to do so. Its members voluntarily resigned en masse from their employment with the major domestic airlines and, through its own actions, it is now not in a position to negotiate on behalf of any of its members who are employed in this industry. It is very difficult to see that there could be any breach of the principle of freedom of association in these circumstances and I guess the Commonwealth will be re- plying in that light.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SITUATION ALONG THE IRAN/IRAQ BORDER</PARA>
<PARA> Ceasefire Line Incidents</PARA>
<PARA> There have been frequent violations of the ceasefire along the Iran/Iraq ceasefire line since the formal cessation of hostilities between the two countries in August 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Some violations, such as that referred to by Senator Newman and which had been reported in the press, have resulted in exchanges of artillery fire.</PARA>
<PARA> Many incidents appear to have resulted from attempts to improve defensive positions along the ceasefire line including the reinforcement of existing positions with additional troops and equipment. On the Iranian side of the line, for instance, a massive defence wall with associated tank ditches and embankments is being developed along a part of this line, together with canals which would enable flooding of the southern border sector if flood gates were opened.</PARA>
<PARA> In spite of these violations and the likelihood that incidents will continue to occur, we are confident that both Iran and Iraq are committed to the ceasefire and that a resumption of full-scale hostilities is unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged by the fact that both sides are engaging in civilian reconstructions in areas adjacent to their border. Iran for instance is rebuilding the oil refinery at Abadan, and Iraq in engaged in the reconstruction of the City of Basra. I interpret these developments as evidence that neither side is intending to resume hostilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Unsponsored Peace Talks.</PARA>
<PARA> Peace talks between Iran and Iraq under UN auspices have continued in stalemate. Iran is demanding a withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Iranian territory as a first step in the peace negotiations. For its part Iraq has claimed sovereignty over the Shatt Al-Arab waterway which runs between the two countries (a position which is at odds with a 1975 international agreement between the two countries defining the border as the thalweg of the waterway).</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the exchange of prisoners of war, there has been no progress to date on this issue and we understand that the Secretary-General's special envoy is attempting to convene ministerial-level talks between the two sides in New York in December to address these issues. In the meantime, I was encouraged to note that Iran's Foreign Minister, Dr Velayati, announced on 16 November that Iran was prepared for an immediate and simultaneous repatriation of prisoners of war and troop withdrawal to international recognised borders.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Involvement in UNIIMOG.</PARA>
<PARA> With no progress in the negotiations between Iran and Iraq, pressures on UNIIMOG will continue. We expect that localised tension will remain at its present level and that there will be occasions when serious breaches of the ceasefire will be recorded. Inevitably this will involve some degree of threat to Australian forces serving in UNIIMOG.</PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances I have described, it is expected that UNIIMOG will remain in place for some time to come and that Australia will continue to support the force, which we consider to be performing a very worthwhile function.</PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Dunn moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to provide that the Order of the Day for the resumption of the debate on the Australian Heritage Commission (National Estate Protection) Amendment Bill 1989 be called on forthwith and have precedence over all other business determined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. The Government, and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, have acknowledged the effectiveness of some legislation which is based on the corporations power of the Constitution. Indeed, on several occasions they have threatened to use that corporations power specifically in relation to logging in the south-east forests of New South Wales. On 26 July this year, when Senator Richardson spoke at the National Press Club in Canberra, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth is unsatisfied with the result of negotiations with NSW after this, then the option for the Commonwealth to use the corporations power will still be there and will be used. </PARA>
<PARA>That was specifically in relation to the south-east forests. In a newspaper on the same day the following report appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, Senator Richardson issued his strongest declaration on the ultimate necessity for greater Commonwealth environmental power and depicted the Federal Coalition as `spooked' by State rights . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister declared that he would use the corporations power against the Greiner Government to protect the National Estate forests around Eden in NSW if federal-State negotiations failed to reach a satisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that this particular debate has been going on with great conflict since the beginning of this year. The reason I raise it now is that if we go into recess and then an election is called, such legislation could be put off for a very long time. I would like to put forward a number of reasons to satisfy Senator Puplick and others in the chamber as to why it is necessary to bring on this debate immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson has also signalled that the Federal Government would resort to the external affairs power against Queensland to protect the rainforests there. This threat to use constitutional powers is very necessary if we are to protect our National Estate around the country. It is clear that State governments have not had the ability to deal with the problem or, as in the case of the New South Wales Government, have been intransigent and will not deal with the problem. It does not call itself `New South Wales Incorporated' for nothing, and it is not for nothing that its favourite phrase is `fast tracking development'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. I have sat here patiently and listened to the interchange between you, Senator Dunn and Senator Puplick. As I understand it, Senator Dunn is arguing that this matter should be brought on for debate immediately instead of somewhat later in the current session. She must explain to the Senate why there is that degree of urgency in the matter. I do not think she has even begun to do that and, on the basis of the argument she has so far developed, she has not the slightest likelihood of being able to do so. Nobody could persuade me that having the Bill debated now rather than in the next three or four weeks would make the slightest bit of difference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I raise the matter now is that public concern over the loss of national assets, especially the natural assets of our country, is mounting. People around the country-not just those who would call themselves greenies but ordinary citizens-are very concerned. They have lost confidence in the ability of their governments, both State and Federal, to protect those assets and accept responsibility for that protection. To answer Senator Stone's objection, in the south-east of New South Wales we know that a critical situation has been developing all year. There is practically a state of civil war down there, as honourable senators might have seen from the recent Couchman program. Communities have been torn apart by the conflict and particularly by the uncertainty of both State and Federal government intentions on the matter. Hundreds of people have been arrested. The cost involved to the people of New South Wales has been phenomenal and there has been violence in the south-east. Shots have been fired; people have been hurt.</PARA></TALK.START>

You have now warned Senator Dunn on a large number of occasions about debating the substance. What she is now discussing clearly has a great deal to do with the substance of this legislation and nothing to do with the motion which is before the chamber at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Dunn, I have tried to be as lenient as possible because there have been many instances when people have spoken to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders for quite some time. The point of order taken by Senator Puplick is, however, correct. You must confine your remarks to why this matter is urgent and not debate the issue. I realise that there are difficulties in doing that. I ask you only to give the reasons why this matter is urgent and why Standing Orders should be suspended.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I fear that if this matter is not brought on, and brought on immediately, we could have further violence in the south-east and conflict within the community. Many people around the country are concerned about this and wish to see a resolution of the problem. If I do not force the debate in the Senate to be proceeded with at a time like this the matter will not be debated but will be ignored by the Opposition and the Government, despite the Government's threats to use the corporations power. Therefore it is up to an independent such as myself to raise the issue in the Senate and to give it the urgency that it deserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear from the media and from concerns expressed by citizens right across this country that environmental issues are almost paramount, second to economic concerns, and that we must address these issues now. The concern of local citizens relates to aspects of the National Estate which I think Senator Puplick may not have considered. People on the Couchman program expressed concern for the Tantawangalo water catchment area, for example, which presently is being logged in a trial logging program by the Forestry Commission. Do we really have to cut off an arm to find out what it is like not to have one? We know from metropolitan water board studies that logging in a water catchment area will affect the catchment. </PARA>

For a very long time conservation groups have been trying to engage the Government and timber workers over this conflict in the south-east. That is why I believe it is imperative for us to be able to discuss this legislation as the only solution to the problems that have arisen, particularly in the south-east but which will arise right across the country. Conservationists have prepared a document called The Wood or the Trees, which is a very substantial 300-page document which attempts to provide the industry and conservationists with a solution that is economically sustainable and realistic and which does not provide any unemployment in the timber industry. This is a serious effort on the part of the under-resourced Australian Conservation Foundation. It has been largely ignored by the Government and particularly by the relevant Ministers.

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to accelerate the pace of reform to achieve a genuine workplace based industrial relations system which will allow Australians to work together more productively to reduce our foreign debt and to stop the slide in living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is probably true that most of Australia is concerned about both the slide in living standards and the extraordinary rise in our foreign debt over recent years and that most of Australia now has come to associate those two negative features of the Australian economy together. The Opposition brings this item forward as a matter of urgency today because of the apparent lack of any sense of urgency within the Government to deal with an issue which really lies at the heart of solving those fundamental problems of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There seem to be two versions of Australia's present position. Over the last couple of days I think that all members of parliament have received a letter from the Business Council of Australia which represents what one might call the worried view about Australia's position. It is by no means a lone voice crying in the wilderness. In recent days in the Senate we have heard references to the Macquarie Bank Ltd, the Industries Assistance Commission, Citibank Ltd and all sorts of bodies which have been drawing attention to what is seriously wrong with the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council has announced to the people of Australia that it will hold a national business summit on debt in March next year. It has talked about the fact that whilst there have been significant reforms and new approaches in the 1980s, the pace of adjustment has not kept up with what is required in a fierce international competitive environment. In the letter sent to all members of parliament the Business Council points out that one of the difficulties in finding solutions is in convincing the community-including the business community-that our rising debt and lack of competitiveness are real problems which, if not corrected, will undermine our economic future. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as we are getting from that very cautious body a clarion call to direct our attention to significant problems, we find the contrary view being advanced, not surprisingly, by the two groups in Australia that seem to be basically satisfied with things as they are. For example, we find that Mr Hawke is reported in the press as having told the Caucus this week that there really is not a debt crisis in Australia, that things are pretty much on track and that the Caucus can be reassured about where we are economically. Just as consolingly, Mr Kelty, who seems to have a fairly close working relationship with Mr Hawke, is reported in today's Australian Financial Review as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> This country is not heading downhill. This country is moving forward at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to address the fact that we think that this is a matter of urgency because the country is not moving ahead. We think that a serious crisis is facing Australia and we think that the Government could be doing practical things about it now. But the fact is that the Government is choosing to do nothing. It is choosing not to take the actions that it could take, that so many people are suggesting it should take, to accelerate the pace of reform. Instead we have this sense of calm and complacency about a deteriorating situation. We think that this motion of urgency is important and is required because we think that the Government knows what is required but lacks either the guts or the gumption to take the necessary action in the face of the vested interests of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), in particular, which is against the changes which could make a difference for the people of Australia, in both an overall sense in tackling our foreign debt and also, more significantly to the men and women of Australia, doing something about their declining real incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just focus for a moment in this debate on why it is that the people of Australia think that there is a problem. The simple truth is that the accord which Mr Kelty entered into with the Hawke-Keating Government is an accord which over nearly seven years has delivered to the people of Australia declining real incomes. It is not just the high interest rates that are currently pressing on so many people. The fact is that, if we look at what Australians earn today compared to what they earned five, six and seven years ago, those incomes are less. They are less because this Government has not been able to manage the economy in a way which ensures that inflation is less than wage rises. Instead year by year wages go up, prices go up even higher and the men and women of Australia are worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were happening as part of a process of economic adjustment which was getting Australia into a good economic condition, we might say it was worth it. But when those declining real wages over a seven-year period are accompanied by a massive upsurge in foreign debt, then clearly the formula is not working. In recent weeks in Australia we have had a succession of reports and comments which make the point that we have an urgent problem that requires focused attention from this Government-not the sort of attention that we have seen given to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who is at the table; not the sort of attention that we saw given to interest rates with a temporary $200m deal with a few banks which momentarily halted the rise in interest rates for a small number of borrowers; not that sort of special dealing that we have seen given to the airlines; not that sort of thing at all. We need a focus on the fundamentals that will make this country prosperous, productive and growing again. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this motion is about. The Opposition is saying that simple practical things could be done to make Australia work better. Those things would accelerate the pace of change, give us some real growth, give us a chance to increase productivity and give us a chance to tackle these problems. We have had a number of debates in these terms. On the day on which the Budget was brought down I proposed a matter of public importance in similar terms to this one. The Minister sitting at the table responded to that debate. Sadly, little has changed since that time. The Government has shown no desire to give attention to these urgent issues. Instead we have a government which is fumbling around desperately looking for a way to cope until it can try to steal an election. We have not got the attention to these vital issues which is required. On 15 August I said that people in Australia are concerned about the spectre of foreign debt, the general sense of declining living standards and the general sense of national decline in a comparative sense. Those sentiments are still true today. There is still not that sense of urgency within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate focuses on what we say is the core problem, which is doing something about the way we work in Australia, doing something about the labour market, doing something about industrial relations-use whichever words you will. We believe that there are practical and simple measures that can be taken in these areas which are not being taken currently by the Government to improve things. We do not-and I make this point because the Leader of the Government indulges in cheap debating points in these debates-say that reform of the labour market is the only thing that is required to be done. The Economic Action Plan deals with a great range of areas of change, such as the waterfront, coastal shipping, privatisation, contracting out, tax and expenditure, which we think are relevant to making Australia perform better. At the core of the changes which are required are changes to the way we work and to the way we regulate our workplaces. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want in the debate to avoid the Leader of the Government saying that we are overlooking major areas of change and to direct his attention to the close coincidence between the details set out in our Economic Action Plan of about a month ago and in the details set out in the Industries Assistance Commission annual report 1988-89 which carefully catalogues the same areas of change as being vital to lift Australia's wealth, to give us the capacity to pay our debts and to lift living standards. I, in no sense, wish to reduce the emphasis that the Opposition would place on those vital areas of change. According to the Industries Assistance Commission, which is a non-political body which is administered under the Public Service which is in the hands of this Government, not in the hands of the Opposition, we have the capacity to have a long term increase in our gross domestic product (GDP) of about $16 billion just by reforming our transport sector, postal and telecommunications services and electricity sectors, and by reductions in rural and manufacturing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a massive capacity to make changes for the better in this economy. The Government is getting plenty of non-political advice on how to do it as well as political advice from the Opposition. The Government should be alert to the fact that what the Opposition is saying, what the Business Council of Australia is saying, what the Macquarie Bank is saying, all have a very strong common thread of there being a series of changes that can be made in Australia to make the Australian economy more efficient and to move to a solution of our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the Business Council and its deep concern about the lack of attention given to the problem of foreign debt. I will refer a little later in the debate to some of the Business Council's suggestions as to what can be done about the labour market to produce some of the improvements which are required. Again, there is a startling coincidence between what it is advocating, after its own independent research and examination of these problems, and what is being advocated by the Opposition. This Government is presiding over successive downgradings of Australia's credit rating. This Government is presiding over successive reductions in living standards in this country. This Government is presiding over monthly increases in our foreign debt, and there is a major ongoing threat to our living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the report of the Macquarie Bank which has been referred to in Question Time in the Senate over recent days. In that report the Macquarie Bank puts down a very stark and, as the Minister who is at the table would say, pessimistic assessment that Australians face the likelihood of foreign debt doubling over the next five years, getting to 44 per cent of our GDP, and reaching nearly 60 per cent of GDP by the year 2000. This is putting us beyond the banana republic category; it is putting us into the category of a bankrupt nation. I make that point because it underlines the urgency of this matter and the need for change in the areas to which this motion refers, in particular, the area of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, there is this extraordinary commonality in the comments of observers, whether we look at comments by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or by a business leader like John Spalvins who, I think the Minister at the table would concede, is one of those people in business who, in the process of reorganising and restructuring a number of businesses around Australia, have managed to lift their efficiency very considerably. He would not be classified as one of those takeover merchants who have reduced the efficiency of the Australian economy. Quite the contrary, he is someone who has made significant contributions to increasing its efficiency. What John Spalvins said in a recent speech to the Institute of Corporate Managers, Secretaries and Administrators brings out the point again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we have to be concerned about industrial relations in this country . . . concerned about where labour costs are heading. </PARA>
<PARA> This, more than any other single factor, I suggest, will dictate the level of inflation, the growth or decline in productivity, and whether we are really capable of competing internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard over-regulation of labour as a very significant barrier to achieving higher productivity, because whenever wage increases are decided it's done nationally, right across the board, regardless of whether a business can afford it or not. </PARA>
<PARA>He explained further the disadvantages of that system, but I do not have time to quote him further. I simply say to the Minister at the table that he should stop rejecting the idea that more rapid change is possible and in fact is absolutely essential, as some sort of political reflex action because he does not want to admit that the Government is not doing an adequate job. Instead, he should start to embrace some of the changes which are being put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the practical things which can be done? We say that it is important to continue some of the top down reforms which this Government has tried to promote and which we have always supported where we have seen them as contributing to greater flexibility and greater productivity. The Opposition supported, for example, the second tier wage negotiations as an improvement on the old system, as a focus on productivity increase. It has had very little practical impact on the gross figures in Australia, but we agree that it has focused attention in a new and more positive way. We have supported award restructuring in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> This top down approach, this bureaucratic approach to change and to greater efficiency, cannot and will not work quickly enough. The results are slow, the results are painful and sometimes the results are nil. I invite the Minister at the table to examine the award restructuring decision in the building industry and to give us his honest opinion on whether there are real productivity gains in that process. I suggest that his answer will be no. What we are saying is that if the system is changed so that there is a greater opportunity for a workplace focus in industrial relations, it is possible to make substantial quantum improvements to productivity. The Minister in his response to the last debate on this subject referred to the fact that the Government has put a provision for certified agreements into the Act. He cited a number of examples which he cited again in Question Time yesterday. He mentioned ICI Australia Ltd and some other company. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, two examples, as Senator Stone says, where productivity improvements have been achieved. Of course we welcome them and are pleased about that, but I can point to the Castle Bacon Pty Ltd case; I can point to the Sanctuary Cove case where agreements of a similar kind were delayed for between one and two years by the obstructive use of the centralised system to prevent employers and employees-including trade unions-working together cooperatively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision in the Castle Bacon case was appealed. I have talked about both cases. In each case the situation was the same. Attempts by employers and employees to work together were sabotaged by small outside elements. They were held up for a very long period when both the employers and the employees had been seeking to do the right thing for themselves and Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the limited time left to me I say to the Minister that we believe that there are some simple, practical things which must and should be done. The first is that attention needs to be given to freeing up the capacity of parties to make agreements where they wish. When parties in a genuinely voluntary way wish to agree, there should not be the capacity to obstruct that agreement that we saw in both those cases which I have mentioned. I point out to the Minister that the quite independent research work of the Business Council of Australia suggests that there are 20 to 25 per cent productivity improvements which can be achieved following that route. I point out that its careful researchers put forward exactly the same proposition as the Opposition has put forward since 1986-for there being a freedom to agree in lieu of operating under awards. </PARA>
<PARA> In a debate on an urgency motion there is not the time to go into all the detail one would wish on that proposition. Suffice it to say that I think there are proper answers to the fear of a wages breakout which are contained, first, in the requirement that the agreements be genuinely voluntary; secondly, in the requirement that maximum competitive pressure be put on people who are in the industry so that they have little room for sweetheart deals; thirdly, our proposal for effective compliance procedures to back up the authority of the Commission where rogue unions or rogue employers might be involved; and, finally, we say that the centralised system-which traditionally has been the source of a wages breakout because small wage settlements in one sector of the economy are spread throughout the economy using the centralised system-has learnt something from the impact of both 1974 and 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn then to the second area which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) addressed during his visit to Japan and which the Opposition has been saying for some time is vital if we are to get a more efficient operation in our workplaces and solve Australia's problems of both debt and declining living standards. The trade union structure in Australia is an absolute barrier to reform. Senator Burns is sitting over there; he is someone who has worked hard in the trade union movement and is devoted to it, but we find that even his Treasurer is making the point that the increasing enterprise focus which is required if we are to solve Australia's problems is obstructed by our trade union structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Minister that the suggestions the Opposition has been putting forward since last year, which we put in legislative form during the debate on the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill and which the Business Council has now independently come to the conclusion are required, simply involve giving people at the workplace greater authority to determine how they will be represented at the workplace. They may choose to be represented by a union; they may not. But what we say is that the system of trade union amalgamations promoted by this Government in concert with the ACTU will do nothing to solve the problem of having many unions within workplaces. We have put forward the specific suggestion that there should be a greater capacity on the part of employees to produce a single enterprise bargaining unit-that is the word of our policy and the words of the Business Council-to produce no more than one trade union within an enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government fails to embrace these positive proposals to accelerate change, it will carry the sole blame for Australia's continuing predicament, for the continuing hardship which is being suffered in the Australian community, and for the continued high risk this country faces in its overall economy. </PARA>

Senator Chaney, of course, begins-he uses the expression in the motion he moves-by talking about living standards. Like his present Leader in the lower House, in measuring living standards he is in fact talking about the use of average weekly earnings as an appropriate measure of living standards. That is the measure Mr Peacock uses. It is a measure Senator Chaney uses. What is meant by average weekly earnings? It is only an average of adult male full time wage and salary earnings. What the use of that measure reflects in talking about average weekly earnings is the Liberal Party view, from which it cannot escape, locked as it is into a society of the 1960s, when that was an appropriate measure. What that measure ignores is the self-employed, retired persons and almost three million women in the work force, a change which has taken place since that was an appropriate measure.</PARA></TALK.START>

Employment growth is taken into account in the household disposable income. After all, this Government has created 1.5 million jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone can recycle the debate whichever way he wants, but he should just face up to that point. Senator Stone was the architect of the recession which brought about all that unemployment in 1981-82 and the man who then told us that we had a big deficit inherited from the previous government, the biggest deficit in Australian history, which has been reduced by this Government and turned into a surplus. That was Senator Stone's role. Now he is up there backing his mates in the National Party in Queensland, where they have different views of cash flow problems from anybody else in Australia. It is all done in brown paper bags up there. That is where Senator Stone's allegiance now lies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measure of household disposable per capita income is the correct measure because employment growth is taken into account. This measure of living standards has increased by an average of 1.2 per cent since 1983-84. The last time the measure of disposable income in Australia fell was in the Opposition's period of government in 1982-83. That is when it crashed. If the Opposition wants to know about that, it ought to have a look at the Budget Papers for 1988-89, where it is pointed out that household income fell by 2.5 per cent and by 2.7 per cent in the subsequent year compared with 1984-85 onwards, when there has been continuous growth except for 1986-87. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone had a go this morning. I listened to him very respectfully in my room. I thought it was a very interesting speech, if I might say so. Senator Stone might do me the same courtesy. Senator Chaney thinks he has a happy conjunction of events at the present time with the comments by the Business Council of Australia about the level of national debt, some comments by the Macquarie Bank and so on. First of all, in response to what I think are the appropriate and thoughtful views put forward by members of the Business Council about the level of external debt in this country, let me say that we by no means retreat from the comments that have been made on that question of the external debt. There is an interesting comment on that issue in today's Australian Financial Review. It says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past couple of weeks the Business Council of Australia and Macquarie Bank have used some expert public relations to focus attention on private debt levels-in particular, debt to foreign lenders. </PARA>
<PARA> It used to be Government debt that everyone worried about, but the Hawke Government has turned that around and is now reducing debt levels. </PARA>
<PARA> But while high levels of private debt are also a worry, they are part of a much more complex set of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia's 47 publicly listed members have a total of $49.8 billion in debt on their 1989 balance sheets, a rise of 15 per cent on the 1988 level . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If the debt debate in Australia concentrates on the absolute levels of debt, whether foreign or local, it will get nowhere and achieve nothing. But if it arrives at a proper discussion of business management and the basic plumbing of capital flows, then the next six months could lead to some most important consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Without wishing to tar all managers with the same brush, what happened during the 1980s was a significant increase in the level of management greed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a comment which I think the Business Council people will face up to. I really think that they are prepared to face up to it. I do not condemn them for that; it is another observation about some of the things they have said. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney, in pursuit of this conjunction of support for making a new speech as distinct from the last one, refers to the Business Council of Australia, the Macquarie Bank and the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which was published recently. The IAC report states that this country has to get on with issues of micro-economic reform. I thought that the IAC report on human resources development and the issues that are currently referred to by most international economists as infrastructure development was a bit weak, but on the issue of micro-economic reform it stated that this country had to get on with some of those issues. I remind Senator Chaney that there is nothing new about the IAC saying that. It said it right through the 1970s when the present Opposition was in government. What did the Liberals do about waterfront issues, transport issues and tariffs? In 1987 the Liberal Government had a report from the IAC recommending a general reduction in tariffs. What did the Fraser Government say? It said, `Oh, no way'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what that policy will do. If Senator Vanstone wants to talk about the 1980s and 1990s, let us do that. My point is that there has been a 65 per cent reduction in tariffs since 1972 and not one percentage point of that was accomplished by a conservative government; not one percentage point in all that time. If the Liberals had displayed just a little courage and tackled some of these issues in the 1970s, we would not be talking today about the present levels of external debt.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be so. I am talking about the country, not about the political fortunes of the collection of wimps over there. This country would not be confronted with the same sized problems that it has today. The present Opposition ran away from those things. So Opposition senators should not come in here talking about the Business Council, the Macquarie Bank, the IAC and all of the other things, because many of those issues involve their credibility as much as anything else. Senator Chaney sought to draw from the Macquarie Bank report the conclusion that this country was almost a bankrupt nation. That is gilding the lily a bit, because the bankrupt nations of the world are countries that have enormous government debts as well as private sector debts. I am not in any sense trying to belittle the problems of Australia's external debt, but let me make that very clear distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then Senator Chaney got onto the industrial relations system and so on. I want to make a couple of points on that matter. The Macquarie Bank makes them and all sorts of people make them; but, whatever the Opposition says about the accord or what other people want to say about it, it has brought about an enormous change in attitudes in this country. It is the umbrella under which industry can be restructured in a sensible and intelligent way; it is the umbrella under which attitudinal change is taking place in this country very rapidly; and it has been the umbrella for the containment of real unit labour costs, which have fallen by more than 14 per cent. I do not want to get into the argument today, because we had it yesterday, about nominal and real unit labour costs. What that has meant is that the profit share for Australian business has been its highest for 20 years, leading to a major investment surge-a 65 per cent increase over the last six years and now at a level of 13.5 per cent of gross domestic product. We used to be told in the past that business profitability was a good thing, and I believe it. I think it is, because it leads to investment. But that is one of the consequences in respect of which the accord has been a responsible and sensible contributor. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Gruen and others at the Australian National University, in a recently conducted study into the accord, made the point-though they are not uncritical-that the great benefits in terms of employment growth and attitudinal change in Australian industry and their effect on corporate profitability have been quite significant and enormous. I understand Senator Chaney's argument and even he, when he is being frank, does not throw the baby out with the bath water. He says that there will still be a centralised wage fixation system for a few years after the Liberals get into office, if they ever do. I do not think there will be a centralised wage fixing system at all by the time they get into office, but hope springs eternal in Opposition hearts and Senator Chaney thinks that that will happen next year and that he will maintain the centralised wage fixation system for a while because that is a good thing for the country in terms of aggregate wages and some of these other things about which I have been talking and which are benefits of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> Further reform of the workplace is under way and has to be under way and is continually on the Government's agenda of building on successes to date. Of course I am an advocate of the view that that reform should be as rapid as possible. I believe that enterprise flexibility can be achieved through plant level implementation of new awards, certified agreements and relaxation of demarcation rules. Senator Chaney says that I gave him only two examples last week. I will give him three or four today. I opened the new Nestle's plant at Blayney in New South Wales during the week. It is a one-union shop. It is a brilliant factory. They have, applying to that factory only, a Federal award which has been negotiated with the employees. These sorts of things are happening all over the place in addition to the certified agreements to which I have referred previously in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Greater emphasis must be placed on skills and productivity in wage rounds. Award restructuring involves the most far-reaching labour market reform ever attempted in this country. Senator Chaney may say that it has not achieved much in the building industry and so on. There will always be places where it achieves better results than in others. One of the most important things for the manufacturing sector is that it will provide opportunities for career paths for workers in manufacturing plants. That is one of the biggest problems in this country at the present time which I face as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. There is an up to 50 per cent turnover in manufacturing plants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, all of those things. There are unique opportunities available to tackle the barriers to improved workplace efficiency and productivity and, provided that people take up those opportunities, there will be more satisfying career structures for Australian workers. Award restructuring processes can also be used for reforming award and union coverage, and it does require a little vision from management and a little activity and initiative from management as well. In most cases where it has been a success it has been management-initiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the Opposition's industrial relations vision, I am not here to condemn out of hand a lot of the things that Senator Chaney says. I think there is a lot of sense in some of them. A lot of people out there are not convinced. Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association was not convinced and Senator Chaney said that Bert Evans did not understand it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a lot of other people out there do not understand it either, Senator Chaney. Ian Spicer of the Confederation of Australian Industry said that, although his organisation was attracted to a number of aspects of the Opposition's policy, it would not be advocating dismantling of the current award system and that there should be some form of registration of industry and enterprise agreements-which is precisely what this Government has provided for. Ken Croagh of the Victorian branch of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures questioned whether employers were ready to handle wage bargaining with an enterprise union outside the centralised system. It is a good question indeed. Of course, Senator Chaney himself has done something quite different. He has ruled out the need to register enterprise agreements with the Commission. I think that is a mistake. He says that the coalition has received senior advice that enterprise agreements would have the force of awards without being registered. But he says, `If the Attorney-General advises otherwise when we get into government, we will change it'. That is a very convenient route for the coalition to escape from that aspect of its policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and the leaders of both the Government and the Opposition. I note that one supported the proposition with more grace than the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason why we propose the amendment and support the urgency motion in its amended form is that the Australian Democrats question the basic traditional attitudes of both unions and management to their relationship in the workplace. In fact, by this amendment, we are underlining the fact that an improvement in industrial relations in this country requires a revised attitude of both unions and management, and it it only through that that we will achieve the necessary new spirit of cooperation-one which has not historically been present in Australian industrial relations-which will allow the resolution of the problems which are cited in the remainder of the urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently there are two basic industrial relations models in vogue in Australia, and it is not unreasonable that the centralised system is being embraced by a Labor government and a decentralised system is being embraced by the alternative government, the coalition. We believe that both of these models should be reformed to include far more opportunities for cooperation between management and workers. When the Opposition comes into power again-whenever that is-Australian industrial relations will move in the direction favoured by Senator Chaney in this motion. It is the Australian Democrats' view that any change, however, must be a slow and incremental one, and must comply with several fundamental bottom line elements which protect basic workers' rights. Today what I am in fact doing is foreshadowing for Senator Chaney the position that would be taken by the Australian Democrats in relation to substantial changes in industrial relations which would eventuate should there be a change in government. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1988 in the debate on the industrial relations legislation in this place we accepted that there were two genuine alternative models of industrial relations and made the point that it was not reasonable for the Opposition at that time to expect us to support a series of amendments-in fact, in excess of 100 amendments-which were born of its decentralised model in an attempt to force them into an Act which was being proposed by a Labor government and which was born of a centralised philosophy of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> In making that point we accept the fact that we foreshadowed that, if there were to be a change of government, we would, of course, expect that the alternative model would be advanced very quickly by the Opposition. This has been the subject of quite long discussions between Senator Chaney, me, my colleagues in the New South Wales upper House and the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, because the alternative model is in fact being advanced in that State fairly quickly, and quite reasonably so. During very open and constructive discussions we have previously acknowledged the fact that we see much merit in the alternative model. However, I think in those discussions we have said there are a number of bottom lines which the Democrats require of either model. Let me state some of them. There must be a guaranteed minimum income; that is, an income support scheme must be in place before any serious change is contemplated. What I am doing is foreshadowing a requirement by the Australian Democrats that the Opposition must address, in parallel and simultaneously, legislation which ensures an income support scheme-a guaranteed minimum income for Australian workers and even, in fact, non-workers. I will develop that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> Poverty prevention must be an absolute priority. Any potential poverty traps must be identified and nullified before a new industrial relations system is implemented. Later I will identify what I consider to be a very real threat of a poverty trap, that is, the automatic removal of unemployment benefits after a statutory period of, say, six months. I see that as being a potential poverty trap for the genuinely unemployed in this country, who would find themselves unemployed with zero income. I believe that these are serious challenges for the Opposition in considering its alternative model. The alternative model must acknowledge the fact that there is a possibility of serious erosion of conditions that have been achieved by workers. As opposed to the dollars and cents dimensions of what people want from work, there are also serious conditions. The alternative model must address seriously the whole dimension of work conditions and ensure the non-erosion of hard-won work conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> We must find an acceptable definition of productivity, if the productivity model is to prove workable. There are positive and negative aspects to both the definition and the measurement of productivity, and the alternative model must address those. The difficulties associated with the definition and measurement of productivity must be acknowledged and we believe that the negative ones must be modified and discounted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats see an inherent danger in the ultimate power and responsibility for industrial relations being given to employers, and we see that as a possible outcome of the alternative model. I see that Senator Parer is shaking his head, but we see it as being a possible outcome of the alternative model. the possible use of the principle of divide and conquer would be totally unacceptable to us. Some of the frayed edges of industrial relations at present-cases such as the proposal to do away with maternity leave in defence-related industries-give an indication of this process of erosion of conditions by which individuals, in arriving at agreements with employers, can seriously negate or erode the unity of conditions in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with the need for increased cooperation between management and unions. We must achieve greater involvement of workers and management in setting long term goals for their enterprise, such as increasing productivity and output, increasing skills of workers and management through training and retraining schemes, and increasing penetration of foreign markets. It is only by agreement and cooperation between both workers and management that this will be achieved. We should also facilitate increased sharing by workers of management decisions and encourage profit sharing. </PARA>
<PARA> The certified agreements provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 enable enterprise bargaining after the Industrial Relations Commission has given its approval. As Senator Button has already said, we are already slowly moving towards enterprise based unions. We must see how well the current provisions work before going further in that direction. It is interesting that there is a contradiction between the principle which has been espoused by the Government of, on the one hand, fewer and larger unions and, on the other hand, the progression towards enterprise based unions, which would lead to a proliferation of unions. I simply cite that as being a contradiction in the position that seems to be newly being taken by both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> Attending to the just and valid needs and claims of workers leads to increased commitment on the part of the workers and increased productivity and profitability. Looking after workers is a very profitable undertaking. For instance, IBM Australia Ltd has introduced several benefits which were considered radical at the time but which have increased worker satisfaction and work force stability and productivity. These include free workplace based child-care facilities, free education in computer services for employees' children in school holidays, free overseas travel incentives, and an active equal employment opportunity policy, including an office dedicated to equal employment opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday morning those of us who read the Australian newspaper were told by Paul Kelly the `shocking news'-they were his words-that enterprise wage deals were inevitable. In his article, Paul Kelly observed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the irony this week is that while Mr Hawke was slamming the Coalition for its obsession with Labor market deregulation, Mr Keating was actually promising to pinch this Liberal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>And to whom was the Treasurer making such promises? He was making them to Japanese investors, who have kindly lent us 18.9 per cent of our gross debt. Japan is our biggest single creditor country. If the Japanese decide not to roll over-that is, to re-lend-our debt when it falls due, Australia immediately becomes a banana republic. This shift in Australian Labor Party policy bemuses those of us who took part in a prolonged debate in December last year to enact the current Industrial Relations Act when, over and over again Labor espoused the centralised model and, in fact, won our support for its enactment, but now we find that that very model, which was enacted just a year ago, is in recent statements by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer virtually being contradicted. The Hansard of that debate will make quite fascinating reading in retrospect. </PARA>
<PARA> There is considerable merit, as the Australian Democrats accept, in the alternative model. We believe it should be embraced slowly and sequentially. I have attempted to outline for the Opposition our bottom line requirements in that progression. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> After `to achieve a genuine' in line 2, leave out `work-place based industrial relations system', insert `co-operative management/worker industrial relations system'. </PARA>

I would also like to support what Senator Chaney said. Basically, I do not see a lot of difference between the motion and the amendment.

<PARA> The past two years have seen the worst terms of trade out of the past 10 years. After nearly seven years of Labor government, this country is approaching an economic crisis. It is not just me standing in the Senate saying that; that is the view of almost every observer around this country. Since this Government came to power, our net foreign debt has increased from $33 billion to $110 billion. It has been estimated that our net foreign debt is increasing every 20 days at a rate equivalent to Australia's total sugar exports for a full year. That is the nature of the increase in the foreign debt of this country. Current account deficits are running at about $2 billion a month and the figure for a full year is now expected to be more than $20 billion for the coming year. That is yet another record for this Hawke-Keating Government-a disgraceful record. This country's interest rates are among the highest in the Western world and are the highest in our history. The inflation rate is locked in at around 8 per cent, which compares with 3 per cent for Japan and 5.3 per cent for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of this quite appalling situation, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who is out of touch, is wandering around trying to convince people that high interest rates are good for them, that the size of our foreign debt is not a problem, that there is no airline dispute, and that no children in Australia are living in poverty. One cannot help but remind the Prime Minister of that little poem by Hughes Mearns. I see that Senator Tate is smiling-he knows the poem:</PARA>
<PARA> As I was going up the stair</PARA>
<PARA> I met a man who wasn't there. </PARA>
<PARA> He wasn't there again today. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish, I wish he'd stay away. </PARA>
<PARA>Someone should remind the Prime Minister of that poem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister claims that the cause of our problems is, on the one hand, that Australians spend too much on imported consumption goods and that the way to fix that is to jack up interest rates with tight monetary policy. He has done that but it has not worked. On the other hand, he claims that the reason our imports are too high is high imports of capital goods for investment which will be beneficial in the long run. They are the two statements made by the Government in relation to this matter. However, neither the Prime Minister nor the Government can have it both ways. What the Government will not admit is that the cause of our problem is that, except in the mining and primary production areas, where we are blessed by nature, we are just not competitive with the rest of the world. We are unable to make the goods that people want or need and, with a few relatively minor exceptions, we cannot compete on world markets with our manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA> An obvious area in which we could make a substantial increase in exports is the secondary processing of our exported commodities. This fact has been known for years; there is nothing new about it, but it seems to have been discovered only in recent times. With few exceptions, this is not being done because it is simply more economic to process overseas. That is a terrible indictment of the situation in which we find ourselves, and a major reason for it is that we persist with an antiquated centralised industrial relations system which guarantees-and has in time guaranteed-low productivity and an absolutely disgraceful reputation for industrial disputation. In that area, regrettably, our record with our trading partners throughout the world is second to none. </PARA>
<PARA> As pointed out by the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) and others, we must increase our exports by 6 per cent a year for the next five years just to stabilise-not to improve but just to stabilise-our existing position. Urgent and immediate reform of the system is needed. I am not talking about the workers or individual unions. The system is at fault. The thrust of the coalition's industrial relations policy to get Australia back on track is to move towards enterprise based industrial relations. When this policy was launched some years ago-I think it was 1986-not unexpectedly the Labor Government forecast disaster if it was implemented. The sole reason for opposition was that it represented a change which would have diminished entrenched power bases. Its opposition had nothing to do with what was best for Australia: it was a reaction to protect its comrades at the top of the heap under the centralised system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, notwithstanding the earlier vilification, we now have senior Ministers such as Senator Button, and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he was in Tokyo recently, talking about enterprise based agreements. I quote in particular Senator Button when talking to reporter Pru Goward as recently as 20 November:</PARA>
<PARA> First of all, let me say there's a lot of, I think, rigidity in the Australian labour market, as the Treasurer observed nearly a year ago. Labour market reform has to be a priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The centralised wage-fixation system, in my view, has served this country very well in a very difficult period of structural adjustment. If we hadn't had it, we wouldn't have had the employment growth we've had: we would have been in much more difficulty than we are now as a country. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment was made on the basis of the system as it was, without change. Senator Button continued:</PARA>
<PARA> But always I have felt, and I think this view would be shared by my colleagues-</PARA>
<PARA>it would be interesting to ascertain whether Senator Burns agrees with this view-</PARA>
<PARA>that as time goes by, we have to gradually liberalise that system, round the edges. </PARA>
<PARA>`Round the edges'-fiddling around the edges. That is what Senator Button said. Then the Treasurer visited Japan, and I think it is worth quoting some of the remarks he made to the Japanese, bearing in mind that he was talking to one of the great post-war success stories-the Japanese. He made a speech to Nomura Securities and dealt specifically with the industrial relations system and wages policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I fully appreciate that Australia's industrial relations record has been a bone of contention with some of the people and companies in this nation with whom we deal. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the greatest understatements I have heard. I dealt with the Japanese in the period between 1970 and 1983. It was more than a bone of contention. It cost this country billions of dollars in lost export income. At least the Treasurer recognised this because he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I fully accept that Australia's industrial relations record fell well short of what was desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement from the Treasurer was absolutely correct. The recognition was there, but he then talked about moving to an enterprise-based system and attempted to define it. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . an exciting and fundamental process of labour market reform . . . The challenge now is to further develop the process whereby enterprises can deal directly with their workforce, as occurs in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>Did he really mean that such a process occurs in Japan? He went on further to state:</PARA>
<PARA>And it is the Accord processes, along with the Industrial Relations Commission, that is bringing this about. </PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . while there is a widespread recognition that wage negotiations must have an increasing enterprise focus, there is also an acceptance that this process must be underpinned by the continuing role for Australia's Industrial Relations Commission and the Accord to ensure effective aggregate wage constraint. </PARA>
<PARA>The Japanese would have laughed themselves silly because, through their trading companies, they know as much about industrial relations as most people in this country, perhaps even more. To say in one breath that we will have the same system as that in Japan and then go on and qualify it by referring to a centralised system which does not exist over there would make them wonder what was happening. In fact, what the Japanese understand to be an enterprise-based wages system is similar, if not almost identical, to the proposals contained in the Opposition's policy. The tentative proposals of Senator Button and Mr Keating are totally different and will not get Australia back on track. I think it is important that we define the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Liberal-National Party proposals as outlined in detail in our industrial relations policy, we want to see agreements reached within an enterprise by employees of that enterprise and its own management. Let us make that clear. This will guarantee productivity increases which will be to the benefit of the employees, the enterprise and the nation. It must be made clear that our approach does not involve squeezing anyone down or knocking anyone over; rather, it involves improving the position of this country and of individuals. Our approach would ensure that the situation is better than it was before and would get us off the downhill path towards a banana republic which is happening as a result of the foreign debt and other matters about which I spoke. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor talks about enterprise agreements, it is analogous with the Prime Minister saying that there is no airline dispute. Based on the Swedish system, the Labor Government wants fewer and more powerful unions, with a single monopoly union under the auspices of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) negotiating with a number of enterprises. It would involve a single union and a number of enterprises. This is doomed to fail because it will involve a number of agreements each basically the same. It gives meaning to the words used by Senator Button which I quoted earlier: `We have to gradually liberalise that system, round the edges'. That does not involve any real micro-economic reform. There is a lot of talk about it, but nothing serious is done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party approach is exemplified by the in-principle waterfront agreement. Time does not permit my canvassing that matter but, once we decide to have an enterprise agreement with one union-and a recognised militant union, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, dealing with half a dozen stevedores on the basis of what they call enterprise agreements-we can back it in that each one of those agreements will contain almost identical work practices, hours of work, et cetera. How on earth can they be called enterprise agreements? I see that Senator Burns is laughing. He knows that it is a joke. In today's Australian Financial Review Mr Kelty is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no objections to paying negotiations at the enterprise level provided they were carried out within the centralised wage-fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot have it both ways. We either have an enterprise-type agreement or we do not. Let me give an example of one of the few genuine enterprise agreements in Australia and how it came to pass. I refer briefly to Power Brewing. To start off with, it did not want an enterprise agreement. It wanted a separate industrial agreement which is the normal way that breweries operate. However, when it came to settling the terms of that agreement, the officials of the liquor Trades Union turned up at Power Brewing. The union delegates on site had asked whether they could be present and when the union officials arrived they asked who those people were. When told that they were the union delegates on site they said, `We're not going to discuss the agreement in front of them'. There was a row and the union leaders left in a huff. The delegates called a mass meeting of their men and said, `Guess what happened to us? We do not want anything to do with this union'. In fact, I am led to believe that the language was much more colourful than that, but the result was that they ended up with an enterprise agreement or, as it is in Queensland, a voluntary employment agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not have time to cover all the points that I wished to cover. No-one would deny that there is a role for unions in the future, but it has to be a changed role. It cannot be the role that has existed for the past 40 or 50 years, although it may have served us well. It is sheer lunacy for a peak body to agree with a government to share productivity across the board, irrespective of who has contributed to that productivity. It is interesting to compare such an approach with the attitudes of the real success stories of Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Senator Burns, who is to follow me in this debate, had the experience last year of seeing that different approach. Over there the attitude is that if someone can afford to pay because he happens to be successful, that is good but, if he cannot do so, companies are built up and not destroyed so that the nation can get into manufacturing and import replacement, so it can be responsible for reducing its current account deficit and so it can create jobs--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no disagreement with what the motion says, particularly as amended by the Australian Democrats, because any sane person in this country would want to see better living standards. They must be based on better productivity and greater wealth in the community. If that is to occur it has to be as a result of recognition of the importance of workers and their right to dignity and equity in discussion and in the outcomes. I would like to answer, quickly, a few of Senator Parer's comments. He talked about Japan. A lot of what he said is true, but Japan's culture is completely different from ours. A stark way to illustrate this, although I do not want to go back to the war, would be to say that it had Kamikaze pilots. I would not imagine Australia being able to get anyone to do what they did. I just point out that the Japanese had and have a different culture. One cannot take a little bit out of a culture, say that it is good and forget about its background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Parer knows better than to say that all enterprise agreements are the same. Of the many enterprise agreements existing under the old system of 29a agreements under the old industrial relations legislation, there are many differences depending on the approach to management by various companies and the response of employees. Prime Minister Hawke never said that we do not have a foreign debt problem. He said that we do and that we must take it into consideration and work at it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney mentioned the need to do something about reduced living standards. I agree with that. When people talk about prosperity and the economy being balanced and in a proper condition, they talk about the balance of payments being right, there being a surplus in the Budget, the credit rating being strong and the dollar being strong so that the country can trade competitively. However, at the same time, a large number of people in the community could be very poor, unemployed and without hope. But some people would say, `That is good. The economy is going all right. Why worry about it?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney also talked about the top down approach as though unions have such an approach: they do not. All the trade unions I know of that are worth their salt are very keen on the pyramid approach where the power and the authority come from the bottom up. The authority is among the rank and file. Obviously they get input from those at the top level who may be better educated and have more experience in how to operate. Certainly, people at the rank and file level are given authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney mentioned the Sanctuary Cove agreement as though it was a catastrophe. The Trades and Labour Council in Queensland negotiated that agreement collectively. One union refused to sign it, but it made no difference. Other unions would have accepted it and, to all intents and purposes, the agreement would have operated. That union had a right to contest it in law in terms of the arbitration legislation and it did so. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the record of coalition governments, as opposed to what this Government stands for and has achieved, we find that since 1949 the coalition has opposed all wage increases. Ultimately in 1982 it brought in a wage freeze. How anybody who was part of a coalition government which brought in a wage freeze can talk about having concern for reduced living standards is beyond me. Fred appears to be quite sincere in what he says. Maybe he does not understand what reduced living standards are because his living standards have never been reduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept your advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. The coalition has also used penalties in every circumstance where there has been an industrial dispute. It has encouraged employers not to go to the bargaining table and not to fix up what may be a festering problem by saying, `You can use penalties. We will not look at the merit of the case. We will just fine people #500 a day'. It was #500 in those days-it is now $1,000 per day-as each day was considered a new dispute. It encouraged Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets and so on to use sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. In Queensland there is the Essential Services Act, the Industrial (Commercial Practices) Act 1984 and the Electricity (Continuity of Supply) Act 1985. When an electricity strike causes a fundamental breach of contract, the contract is cancelled immediately and people can be dismissed immediately. People can be dismissed without notice from employment and suspended from employment without pay for such periods as an employer thinks fit. No-one has the right to question that. It is written into legislation and is very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is that what the Liberal Party stands for? Does it stand for the type of thing that has occurred in Queensland, which reinforces the right of the employer not to renegotiate? It does not talk about issues such as safety and life threatening problems that it will not apply to. Are companies right to refuse to negotiate and to deny the rights of people on the job to take industrial action? That is something which I reject. The people of this country have rejected it time and again and they will continue to do so. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, put out a press release on the New South Wales Government's new industrial relations discord stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals also attempt to ban industrial action for the duration of an award or an agreement (1-3 years). This will lead to bigger, longer and more bitter industrial disputes when awards/agreements come up for renewal. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of harsh penalties will do nothing to stem disruption, but will only make it worse. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur absolutely with that. We cannot bludgeon people into accepting positions. We cannot legislate to force people to accept an unfair and inequitable position. What is the coalition's position? I refer to a paper presented by Mr Justice W. K. Fisher at the University of New South Wales. He quoted Senator Chaney, when being interviewed by the Australian, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The mistaken belief about the Opposition's industrial relations policy is that under a Coalition government, wages would be set by enterprise-based bargaining. They wouldn't. At least not for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Opposition Industrial relations spokesman Senator Fred Chaney, during the first few years of a Peacock government, the centralised wage system would rule. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently Senator Chaney thinks it is a great idea. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) would set wages for the majority of Australia's workers and-after being given new teeth to enforce compliance-would be stronger under a Coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, Senator Chaney is going to use the system we use, the centralised system, but he is not going to talk to the trade unions about it. He will not get any agreement; he will bludgeon them with penalties. He wants greater penalties, more teeth. In a speech at the Sydney Hilton Hotel Mr Peter Morris said:</PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in years Australians have a clear policy choice between the Government and the aspirants in the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice is between hard fact and fairytales, real experience and armchair theory. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservative alternative has not shown that it can restrain overall wage growth; indeed it has shown the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> And what is more, the architects of the 1981-82 wages blow-out have not changed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not deny that the trade unions had a role in that, but they have learned by it. The 1972-1975 Labor Government went through periods of inflation and high wage increases. We have learned from that; but it does not seem that the old recycled team of Peacock, Howard, Hewson and Senator Stone have learned from it. They are hardly the people I would look to for guidance on the future of this country. Further, Senator Chaney said in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA> Higher productivity is essential if this country is to tackle its balance of payments and foreign debt problems . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is true. One could not argue with that. I agree absolutely. Senator Chaney continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The present Federal Labor Government appears incapable of taking the measures necessary to boost productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>I will get to that in a moment. Before I do, let us look at an example of the people in the grain industry who are represented by the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia. The Australian Wheat Board indicated that it would load a ship in Brisbane. It was told that if a union worker was used to supervise loading, a first-aid officer would be required on the wharf. I believe that someone should be there to ensure maximum safety for people who work in those sorts of industries and are subject to serious injury. As a result of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) reaching agreement with the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and stevedoring companies, there will be a 72 per cent cut in manning levels on ships loaded at the Brisbane Fisherman's Island grain terminal. The number of waterside workers was cut from six to 1.6 per shift. </PARA>
<PARA> If somebody had told Senator Parer and Senator Chaney 10 years ago that that was going to happen they would have laughed, and so would I. That is a pretty fair gain, and I do not think the Opposition should be too greedy. It should allow further discussion to take place on achieving another system which would ensure the safety of the waterside workers but would also look at maximising productivity capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the enterprise agreements, I mentioned a while ago that the provision existed under section 29a of the old industrial relations legislation. But we talk here about certified agreements. Section 115 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the parties to an industrial dispute or any of them agree on terms for the settlement of all or any of the matters in dispute, they may make a memorandum of the terms agreed on. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 115 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The memorandum of agreement shall specify the period for which the agreement is to continue in force. </PARA>
<PARA>The section goes on to talk about how this will occur. This is an agreement that can be negotiated between the workers and the management in an enterprise. One thing is certain: that should not occur without the right of union members to be represented. Certainly the employers would be represented. It is worth citing again the answer given by Laurie Carmichael in evidence in the inquiry leading up to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation: Making it together. Laurie Carmichael said:</PARA>
<PARA> The trade unions represent [that] professional advice to the work force and to deny the work force the right to that trade union representation is to deny equity and to confirm the inequality of power in the work place. </PARA>
<PARA>We can have enterprise agreements under the framework of the Industrial Relations Act. Such agreements will be freely entered into and should be honoured. They would not be thrust upon people from above but would be agreed within the framework of understanding the economic needs of this country in terms of wage restraint, and the way in which the saving in wages has been directed to profits among certain employers and companies, some of which have wisely reinvested in better machinery, better training for management, better management approaches. We understand that. The trade unions are mindful of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney, and probably Senator Parer, said that the union structure was obstructive. I agree that no organisation such as a trade union that has been in existence for 70 or 80 years should retain the same structure. One must move with the times. One must look to the future, be creative and put forward ideas which will contribute to the whole and are in the interests of the community. It was mentioned that industry unions would not eliminate one union in the workplace, but that is not true. They would. There would be one union in the enterprise and one in the industry; there would not be one union in each enterprise. Of course, unionists in those enterprises should have the right to have the framework of support and advice from a properly and democratically structured trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing this Government has done in practical terms is to offer workplace resource centres. They will be used to set objectives and goals, to redesign individual or group jobs and to further understanding of motivation and morale strategies and develop and administer in-house training programs. This can work only if there is trust and belief between the parties. But the Government as a third party is doing its job, accepting its responsibility to provide some support in setting up those things. In the final analysis, the difference between somebody who has the right to strike and somebody who does not is that between a free man and a slave. There is no doubt about it. As I said, it eliminates the need for any employer to negotiate genuinely. But the question of the use of that right to strike is another matter. We should develop the concept of cooperation in the interests of the community, as the motion says; but it has to be done in a way whereby, as I said, people's rights and their dignity in the community are recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the urgency motion moved by Senator Chaney and amended by the Australian Democrats to read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to accelerate the pace of reform to achieve a genuine cooperative management/worker industrial relations system which will allow Australians to work together more productively to reduce our foreign debt and to stop the slide in living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>I take it from remarks made by those on the other side of the chamber and by a number of interested parties through the media that the Government would support this motion but would prefer to have after it, in brackets, (but only if the unions are involved). I think that therein lies the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need for me to spell out what sort of trouble the Australian economy is in. Suffice it to say that we are in trouble-big trouble. We have escalating foreign debt, declining living standards and phenomenally high interest rates. One does not need to go on. The Government's solution, as offered today, seems to be a bit more of the same. It says that things are a bit better than last year and will probably be a bit better next year. We say that that is not enough. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) likens the economy to a glass of champagne that is simply too effervescent and bubbling over. Meanwhile, people with mortgages or with loans for business in South Australia-where they will have the opportunity to send a message to Canberra in the next week or so-and in every other State and Territory are drowning in a sea of interest rate increases. For years the coalition has repeatedly said, as Senator Chaney pointed out, that one of the fundamental problems we have at present is our rigid labour market system, our centralised wage-fixing system. Not everybody agreed with us when we first canvassed this issue. It might be instructive to consider what our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in 1985. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> How can one possibly talk about applying an economic policy if one has abandoned a whole incomes policy situation and said that wages and salaries in this country will be determined not within a centralised system but by allowing negotiation and the exercising of bargaining strength to take place in industry after industry and in enterprise after enterprise?</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Prime Minister said that in 1985, he seems to have had a change of heart. Headlines in the newspapers in the last couple of days have the Prime Minister urging business to move towards enterprise-based negotiations. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and many others are now finally acknowledging the urgent need to deregulate our labour market. Recently in Japan the Treasurer gave an extraordinary speech to Nomura Securities. On the one hand he attempted to endorse some of the better elements of the coalition's industrial relations policy, saying to the Japanese that we need to operate more like the Japanese management; but, on the other hand, as Senator Parer pointed out, tacking on conditions saying that we want to act like Japan, but not really like Japan. In other words, we want to have our cake and eat it too. We just cannot have it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of days much mention has been made of enterprise-based agreements. On the surface it might appear to the casual observer that the coalition had won this debate and that there was now unanimous agreement that we have to work towards enterprise-based agreements. That would be a good thing. It gives power to the people who need it, the people on the shop floor, to negotiate directly with their employers should they so choose. I am loath to understand why some people do not seem to agree with this. But when we scratch the surface of that apparent agreement we see a very different picture. We see the Australian Labor Party very strongly still in the vice-like grip of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, acknowledging that there is a need to go towards enterprise-based agreements but knowing that its legs would be cut off by the ACTU if any attempt were made to move that way without involving the unions and keeping the union hand in there. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear that the coalition is not suggesting that unions have no place in industrial relations negotiations; quite the opposite. Our policy spells out that, where employers and employees choose to make a voluntary agreement between themselves, employees specifically retain the right to nominate a union to negotiate on their behalf. There is no question of coalition policy trying to muscle out unions or to legislate against their capacity to represent workers. The policy very much protects the right of workers to nominate a union to do that for them. That is the difference. We protect the right of the workers to seek the union's assistance should they so choose, whereas the Labor Party wants to protect the right of the unions to negotiate on behalf of workers whether the workers want them or not. That is probably a key difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party says that it wants enterprise-based agreements; but it says that union restructuring, award restructuring, must come first. I am at a loss to see why, albeit I can see that some restructuring of the union movement and, in some cases, award restructuring might make a contribution. However, this is certainly not a complete barrier to moving towards deregulating the labour market now. The Government says that in any event these agreements must be approved by the Industrial Relations Commission. In other words, the employees and employers can discuss what they will and come to what agreement they will; but, if the Industrial Relations Commission does not like it, bad luck. In order for these agreements to get certification from the Industrial Relations Commission, they will have to look very much the same as each other, as Senator Parer pointed out in his earlier remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to some of the reasons why it is so important that we give power back to the workplace to negotiate the wages and conditions that suit the workers in that industry and in that enterprise rather than trying to come to some sort of lowest common denominator that suits that industry across the nation. When one considers that two-thirds of the Australian work force is not unionised, one can see that not everybody in the work force is that impressed with what unions have been doing with them. Australian unions have less support than one might imagine. Two-thirds of Australian workers have made their views clear by not being unionised. One might therefore ask how unions survive. They survive in the current form because of the ludicrous situation whereby about 85 per cent of the work force is covered by awards even though they are not in the relevant unions. In fact, this non-union labour is roped in, irrespective of its will, to be covered by these awards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not encourage for one minute the development of enterprise-based agreements until it can be sure that the unions will retain this protected position. The coalition says that there is no need to wait. We can immediately give Australian workers the right to negotiate on their own behalf-give them the right, not badger them into it as the previous speaker, Senator Burns, seemed to believe we were attempting to do. We would give them the right to choose to negotiate on their own behalf or to have a union do so if they would prefer that. The Government seems to believe that the Australian work force is simply incapable of doing this; but we say that workers should have the right to negotiate on their own behalf with their employees. We can offer this choice, and that is what it is-a choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who are happy in the central system, who like the protection it offers, who are comfortable in it and are reluctant to enter a deregulated market-I speak in the sense of employees and employers, because not everybody has the strength of ICI Australia Ltd and Comalco Ltd to hop out into the big, wide world immediately-can stay in the central system. But those who choose to opt out, who have confidence in themselves and their capacity, who believe that employers and employees together can come to a better deal for both, are welcome to do that under our system. They are not going out into a completely unprotected area; workers would be protected by a minimum hourly rate and, as I say, should they choose would have the right to nominate a union to act on their behalf. In that respect, I make some remarks to Senator McLean who earlier said that he was very concerned about the rate of progress the Opposition, when in government, would choose to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the system that I have outlined, the rate of progress is left up to the employers and employees and they can go as quickly or as slowly as they feel capable of doing. This is not a change driven by a government standing behind them with some sort of lash; it is a change that gives people the opportunity to have a greater control over their own lives as employers and employees, should they so choose. The Labor Party does not put much faith in the capacity of its work force to act without the big brother unions and the Industrial Relations Commission. In other words, it is not letting the workers out of the club. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor makes much of its interest in status of women matters. I remember, as might Senator Knowles, and you, Madam Acting Deputy President, attending a ceremony to look at a tapestry that we gave to the United Kingdom. The tapestry said: `Trust the women, Mother, as I have done'. It was created to encourage the United Kingdom to give women the vote as we had done in Australia. I say that, if we can trust women to vote, we can trust them to negotiate their own working conditions. It seems eminently obvious. The Government, in its affirmative action legislation, made it a required step for employers to consult their female employees. The Government in the legislation effectively told employers that they must listen to the women. But when it comes to wages and conditions, the Government says no. Women still have to listen to the unions and to the Industrial Relations Commission. Why not trust the women to negotiate if they choose to do so?</PARA>
<PARA> I concentrate, albeit briefly, on the position of women not only because the Government chooses to make much of its, at the moment, somewhat limited contribution to advancing the status of women but also because what women are doing in relation to unions is very interesting. They are voting with their feet to show the unions what they think unions can do and have done for them. In other words, women do not think much of unions. They know that they have been distanced from decision making in the workplace. The decisions are made by union bosses, in other States in all probability. Women are not adequately consulted and they know that. Women are effectively locked out of the union hierarchy. A few women hold positions of status in unions, some of whom have done a very good job. But there are very few of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be worth while to consider just a few of the statistics to see what Australian women, who will be playing such an important part in dismissing this Government at the earliest opportunity, have to say. Let me quote from an article by Sue Neales, a journalist with the Australian Financial Review, in her Corporate Women column very appropriately headlined `Shrinking unions jump on the female bandwagon'. She points out:</PARA>
<PARA>But statistics show that it is the female workers who are turning away from unions in droves. In 1976, when only 1.8 million women worked, 43 per cent belonged to their relevant unions. </PARA>
<PARA> But last year, the number of women with jobs had climbed by 800,000 to 2.6 million. </PARA>
<PARA>The interesting thing is that now only 35 per cent of them are choosing to join a union, a drop from 43 per cent to 35 per cent. The unions can see the writing on the wall because they are not doing the job. They are not doing a good enough job in representing women. That is why women are giving them the boot. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976, the number of women joining the work-force was up by 38 per cent, but the increase in female union members was only 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 1.5 million new jobs created by the Hawke Government-</PARA>
<PARA>allegedly created, as the Government says it created the good things and discarded the bad-</PARA>
<PARA>only 100,000 are now filled by union members. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition says to the Government: move now to give women the right to choose whether to stay in the central system or to negotiate their own wages and conditions with their employers; give all workers, irrespective of their sex, this choice; give industry a chance to show some innovation in the wages and conditions that it offers; get the employer and the employee together and the outcome will be a happier work force, a more productive work force and more profitable companies. That has to be a good thing. </PARA>

<PARA> The need for the Government to accelerate the pace of reform to achieve a genuine workplace-based industrial relations system which will allow Australians to work together more productively to reduce our foreign debt and to stop the slide in living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator McLean has added to the original motion the expression, `a genuine cooperative management/worker industrial relations system', which I think improves the original motion. The reality is that this is exactly what this Government is doing. I take up the very last point that was mentioned by Senator Vanstone, namely, the position of women. At the beginning of its term the Government, with the accord, set in place a measure to make sure that the unemployment that we inherited from the Fraser Government would be eliminated. The particular beneficiaries of that action have been women in this country. Thousands of women have entered the work force for the first time. The greatest increase in women entering the work force has occurred during the period of this Government. So, that accord not only laid the general basis for an improvement in the real standard of living, as Senator Button has pointed out, but also started the Hawke Government's emphasis on cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government then moved to the critical area of establishing the framework of award restructuring. The metal industry is a classic example of where a major change, an historic change, is taking place in industry. There has never been such a qualitative change in industry as this Government initiated. In the past things that it was said would never be done are actually being done. The examination of work practices and the beginning of the examination of management practices are changing the face of Australian industry. Industry agreements in the steel, textile, shipbuilding and heavy engineering industries, which represent micro-economic reform, are of particular credit to Senator Button. We can go through a whole litany of industries that were in difficulty but have been helped and supported by this Government which has created a genuine change both in industry and in industrial relations. All of the changes were on the basis of a tripartite system of working through the problems which consisted of issues that had stagnated for decades but that this Government grabbed hold of. </PARA>
<PARA> We went from the experience we had in the Fraser years when thundering statements from Ministers-I remember that Senator Chaney was one of those Ministers-were made but where neglect, distrust and disputes were the order of the day. During the period that this Government has been in office we have set about having the supportive mechanisms so that change can take place. We have been successful because a mobilising of goodwill has occurred in contrast to the situation in the previous decades. This Government has the runs on the board because it has been able to persuade unions and employers to work together more productively-as the matter of urgency says-identifying the problems and seeking solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The mention of unions separates the position of the Government from that of the Opposition. Senator Chaney talks about reform of the labour market. The Opposition has a problem. It wants to weaken or eliminate unions. It wants, at least, to deny them, because it tries to say nothing about unions most of the time. Senator Burns has pointed out that Senator Chaney has said that the Opposition will allow the central wage system to last for some time while he adds some pressures for compliance by unions. That is a sort of a compromise on the basic thrust of the Opposition which on the extreme side, as you will appreciate, Madam Acting Deputy President, is enterprise unions on the Queensland model and on the other side is just a general acceptance of attacks on unions, attempting to undermine the balancing between capital and labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions are the main weapon that wage and salary earners have to establish their general standards of income and their disposable income. When the Opposition talks of enterprise agreements, it means that it wants enterprise unions. I would like to talk about this in a practical way. It is one thing to talk about labour market deregulation. The coalition means, when it says labour market deregulation, something like this. Take a classic company of 50 to 100 employees which now has a framework of national industrial negotiation. The unions have the ability in that system through awards to lay down the standards by argument before the Commission. Employers and unions appear before the Commission and a standard is laid down. This has been ignored by Senator Vanstone in the speech she just made. She forgets that, regardless of how many people actually join a union industry, the basic protection has been set by the unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the example of the employer of 50 to 100 people. At the moment the national union would be involved. The State branch of the union would be involved as well as the employers' organisation and all the employers who are respondents to the award. The coalition's secret strategy is to say to those 50 or 100 people, `You now cannot have the use of the union's resources'. But the employers will still have the resources of the employers' organisation. They will have the lawyers, the economists and the professional advice to be able to negotiate with 50 or 100 people in a particular enterprise. This gives the lie to what Senator Vanstone said. It is not simply a case of people working things out. The employers at every stage will have the advantage of professional assistance. What chance do the 50 or 100 people have in this situation? Senator Chaney will say, `We will allow a union, a paid hand, a lawyer or somebody to represent the employees'; but the trick is that 50 or 100 people will have very limited resources as against an employer who is a member of a major employers' organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the fundamental flaw, the fundamental bias, in the coalition's industrial relations policy. It is not fair. It means that ordinary people in an enterprise, whether they are males or females will not have the resources available to the employers. Senator Vanstone indicated a lack of knowledge of industrial relations when she suggested that women in some way-or men for that matter-can cope when such tremendous, powerful resources are ranged against them. In contrast, this Government has created the parameters for working together far more productively. At the enterprise level the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, last year introduced legislation which allows for an enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the salient characteristics of this system that allow an enterprise agreement in such a way that people will not be exploited. A certified agreement is simply one form of award, with special characteristics. It allows for flexibility; yet avoids the undesirable outcomes of a totally decentralised system. It provides scope for the development of arrangements designed to reflect the particular requirements of an individual employer or enterprise; yet it guarantees certainty in relation to labour costs which will apply during the period of the agreement, and enables appropriate management decisions to be taken in the knowledge of such predetermined labour costs. Certification ensures that the agreements do not result in exploitation or a wages explosion. That is what the Fraser Government gave us in 1981-82. The Commission must be satisfied that it is in the interests of the parties immediately concerned. It must not be contrary to the public interest to certify the agreement. An agreement may contain provisions which are inconsistent with general Full Bench principles. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, therefore, every flexibility in the existing industrial relations system. That is why I can assert that our system is moving to allow companies experienced in dealing with this legislation-it is only a year old-to be able to use it. As people become more aware of it, more individual enterprises will, as Senator Button has pointed out, institute an award, which is one alternative, or a registered agreement. So, this is part of the development of the consensus style of agreement. But the Government is going further-and this is in line with Senator McLean's amendment-because we are encouraging, at the same time as award restructuring is going on, the introduction of modern management techniques in manufacturing such as total quality control, which is just in time, material resources planning, critical path planning, and similar systems of modern manufacturing. The successful economies of Sweden, Germany and Japan which have used this system have one characteristic which we aim to achieve, and that is a high degree of cohesion between management and the work force. Everything this Government is doing is in an attempt to create that characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA> The management-work force relationship, which under this Government is based on a non-discriminatory, participatory and consultative type of system, has a chance of success. If we examine what has happened we find that in 1987 the Australian Council of Trade Unions adopted a strategy called Australia Reconstructed-a strategy of trying to influence all of the labour movement to change direction. Indeed, the trade union movement has led the Australian work force in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney talked of a top down approach. The peak body of the Australian trade union movement decided to try to modernise industrial relations in this country. The Government has done everything to continue that process. One of our problems is that the Opposition in its policy-and this is clear from everything it has said and done-does not want to continue in that tripartite style. It means that we will end up with the Fraser Government style of confrontation. The Fraser Government may have been dead for some time but there are still living examples of that style of confrontation. Queensland is one example. New South Wales will quickly increase confrontation. It is already a characteristic of the Greiner Government and of other coalition governments. I do not believe that the Australian people, having seen how things can change in a positive way, will return to the ways of the past, when decisions were based on ideological conviction rather than on a commonsense approach to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> I will answer the question that has been raised about trade unions not amalgamating. The major change that is occurring in unions is quite extensive. Unions are actually in the process of reducing their size, and changes are occurring which were never thought possible. The unions understand that, with a government such as the Hawke Government, changes can be made. The Government has created a supportive atmosphere which is necessary in order for people to make changes. They know that changes will stick, that changes can be contemplated and taken through because the Government is supportive. This Government has made real changes. This is occurring in the whole of the trade union movement, with very few exceptions. Its participation has never happened before in Australia's history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the various contributions that have been made to the debate on this motion. I wish to use the couple of minutes that are available to me to respond to some of the points which were raised. I express some disappointment that Senator Button spent a good part of his speech explaining in some detail why he thought the Hawke Government was superior to the Fraser Government in certain areas. I would have thought that the relevant debate was whether the Hawke Government is coming to grips with the quite drastic difficulties which Australia faces in terms of debt, living standards, interest rates, and so on. The fact that in the late 1980s things are being done differently from the way things were done in the late 1970s is scarcely surprising; but the inadequacy of what we are doing is attested to by the many reports referred to in the debate, such as the Industries Assistance Commission report, the Macquarie Bank report or the Business Council of Australia report which called for a debt summit, and so on. I do not believe that that sort of comparison is any more useful than my standing here and saying that the Fraser Government was a lot better than the Whitlam Government. Time moves on and the country has to face the problems of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button also talked about some of the positive aspects of recent years. Of course, there are positive aspects. He talked about the fact that profit share is at its highest level for 20 years. I ask Senator Childs, who has just taken his seat and who has had a long history in the trade union movement: Does the Australian Labor Party really believe that higher profit share, which I, like Senator Button, support, is sustainable over the long haul if real wages continue to decline? To maintain the higher profits that are essential to promote investment in Australia, to create jobs and wealth and to pay off our debts and raise our living standards, we have to get an increase in productivity which will also support higher real wages. The Liberal and National parties do not believe that a continuing policy of low wages is right for the long haul. It might be okay for a period of economic adjustment; it is not a suitable long haul solution. We reject it and believe that changes are essential. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to respond to Senator McLean's very interesting contribution, which went to the views of the Australian Democrats concerning supporting under the next government a new system of industrial relations. I am very glad that Senator McLean has publicly indicated the point that he and I have discussed privately on a number of occasions and perhaps debated on the Government's industrial relations legislation. The Democrats took the view that the Government was entitled to its shape of industrial relations. The next government, the coalition government, will be promoting a different shape; not a radical sort of sudden chucking out of what is in place, but a reshaping and an accelerating of the processes of change that are already occurring which will give Australian workers more interesting work, better career paths and higher real incomes in a healthier economy. This is not an anti-worker, anti-union approach; it is quite the reverse. But my concern-and I put it quickly on the public record-is that if Senator McLean is suggesting, for example, that we want a guaranteed minimum income (GMI) scheme of the sort which is sometimes talked about where, whatever we do, we have some guaranteed minimum income, I think we are going to need to talk further, because there is plenty of study to show that the idea of a guaranteed minimum income of itself could be quite destructive of living standards. Therefore I simply say that, whilst of course the Opposition will be supporting a very substantial social security system, the system that we have in this country, and whilst it will be supporting a floor under wages so that there cannot be a falling away of wage standards, it certainly would need to look very carefully at any what might be called formal GMI system. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as poverty prevention is concerned, the best guarantee against poverty is a growing economy. The countries which are wiping out poverty best are those countries which are growing. I think that is a very important part of the response to the point that he makes. I do not regard that as a complete response. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report from the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) deals with the future of Australian astronomy. Interestingly enough, this is the third major report which has been forthcoming from ASTEC on this subject. The previous two reports were a report in 1979 entitled The Next Generation of Australian Telescopes and a report in 1982 entitled New Telescopes for Australian Astronomy in the 1990's. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of pride for Australian science, and indeed technology, that we have established a position of world leadership in astronomy-one of the most esoteric of fields. It is also one of the fields that are most likely to respond to major developments in high technology in terms of both the building, design and construction of terrestrial telescopes and getting into the very exciting fields of space-based telescopes and the astronomy which derives as a result of those technological innovations. As a result, one can say that Australia has an enormous intellectual base upon which to build as far as astronomy is concerned. The great shame is that a lack of commitment and a lack of investment by the Hawke Labor Government over the whole of its term of office is now starting both to waste the capital resource that we have and to put strains on the scientific community in Australia who are dedicated to making progress in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The most exciting and innovative things are happening in terms of space research and astronomy. I have had the pleasure of looking at some of the American facilities at places like the jet propulsion laboratory at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston and having a look at one of the Galileo probes under construction. We have all been impressed, almost beyond belief, by the nature of pictures coming back from the deep space probes and satellites. We know that there is most extraordinary work going on at the moment: recent discoveries in the theories of cosmology and cosmic evolution; and the recent detection by astronomers of light coming from what we believe to be the edge of the universe, which might give us some indication of the actual distances in the universe, the actual age of the universe and the process by which the universe was actually created. </PARA>
<PARA> But all of that requires, of course, that we have in countries such as Australia astronomers who have the capacity to continue their studies in Australia, who have the resources in Australia to contribute to the interpretive work which needs to be done and, above all, who have access to facilities here in Australia at which they can continue their work and research. People such as Dr Leo Dintenfass, whose work on blood rheology has impressed the United States Administration sufficiently for some of his experiments to be included in a couple of the space shuttles, cannot now get adequate funding for his work. We have in this country astronomers of great repute who are quite legitimately complaining that delays and decisions to defer things for another five years, or whatever it happens to be, will simply destroy the resource that we have available and will encourage people to travel overseas, stay overseas, study overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a report to be welcomed. What is not to be welcomed, however, is the Hawke Government's continuing neglect of this area, its failure to invest in basic research and its failure to give adequate support to Australian astronomers by providing them with the resources needed to keep the technology on the ground up to date and to continue to build upon one of the areas of scientific expertise in which Australia is an absolute world leader. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not repeat many of the things that I would also have liked to have said about astronomy in Australia. I am disappointed in the report that has come down from the Australian Science and Technology Council. It sounds more like the report of a government department than of an independent scientific authority. I believe that its advice at all stages needs to be bold and independent and to be seen to be so. Australia is in a pre-eminent position with a huge international importance. Because of the southern skies, the lack of pollution, the clear weather and all the other things that we enjoy, Australia is very important internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we had taken the same attitude towards the Australia Telescope as it appears that we are taking towards the proposed new eight-to-ten metre optical telescope, it would never have been built. In the Australia Telescope we have an item of great international importance. If we go ahead with this eight-to-ten metre optical telescope in the next six or eight years, it will present the same opportunities. Certainly the technology is improving every day and the longer we leave it the more up to date it will become; but we want to be part of that development and we want to be in there doing the things that other people will find useful as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the country should be allocating something in the order of $10m to $20m a year at this stage with a view to creating a kitty to build this new optical telescope by the mid-1990s. We want to have all of the planning under way by then. It is absolutely the single most important item that will come up for astronomy in the decade ahead. The work should be going ahead. There should be the commitment at least. We do want to retain our position and this is the only way we can do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative to which Senator Puplick alluded is that, unless we do that, we will go down the same track we have gone down with so many other scientific pursuits. With the aid of this Government we have seen so many things disappear or wind down, and this will be just another one unless we get out now and start kicking and screaming. We should be out there now looking for partners and not just saying that we will have another look at this deal in five years time. We should be out there stitching up deals all the way. </PARA>
<PARA> We are spending a total of only about $20m a year in Australia on astronomy, and that covers all the universities, Mount Stromlo, the Anglo-Australian telescope and everything else. So it is not an enormous expenditure. To stay in the field we will have to make an extra commitment. There may be problems for those Ministers who want to see a quick cash return and want to shunt this off to the State or local government and have somebody else pay. Investment in this field is most important, and nothing ranks as highly for the 1990s. I would like Australia to make a commitment. Where are we in regard to the future? This Government has come up with nothing at all to demonstrate to people what Australia is all about, where we are heading, how we get there, what the goals are and what we see as important-any of these things. Only by starting to bite off a few of these things and make commitments towards them will we get Australia some way out of the mess that seven years of Keatingism has created. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission annual report was presented to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) under the signatures of the three commissioners-Mr Justice Morling of the Federal Court of Australia, Dr Colin Hughes and Mr Ian Castles. The Australian Electoral Commission was established as an independent statutory authority in February 1984 and the stated mission of the Commission is to ensure a fair and equitable Commonwealth electoral system. The primary functions are noted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>to conduct parliamentary elections which accurately record voting intentions and are honest, equal in their treatment of electors and universal for all entitled to the franchise; and to conduct elections and ballots required under the Industrial Relations Act . . . and to ensure they accurately reflect electors' voting intentions. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to speak with particular regard to the election for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, which was held on 4 March this year, bearing in mind the stated objectives of the Australian Electoral Commission. It is noted in the report that the system used was the modified d'Hondt electoral system. It is stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> For the election, an extremely complicated electoral system, unlike any other in the world, was used. Modified d'Hondt combines the European party list proportional representation d'Hondt system, the Senate proportional representation system, and various mechanisms for preferential voting for candidates and parties, both within and across party lines. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission stated in December 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an election on this system could take up to two months to count and its assessment proved correct. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it took exactly two calendar months to count because the election was held on 4 March and the result of the election was announced on 4 May. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Commission has put out a video describing the procedure using this particular electoral system. Anyone who sees the video will understand why the count took so long. Obviously it is a very complex process. During the count, the ballot papers, which were huge, had to be sorted into six groups, three of them involving the different ways the elector could vote for a party, two in which the elector could vote for an independent and, of course, the informal vote, and then the papers had to be sorted into 85 categories. Various coloured stickers were used and the count had to be done and redone at certain stages. Indeed, experienced staff had to be used because apparently the errors of one inexperienced staff member who counted for two hours cost the whole system two days to rectify. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech at the declaration of the poll, the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Officer, Mr Geoff Marles, said:</PARA>
<PARA> If taking two months to count the votes is unacceptable to the community, there is one and only one way to solve the problem, and that is to replace the modified d'Hondt system. If such a change is not made, if the same number of candidates run at the next election, and if the voters record similar ranges of preferences to those they recorded this time, the one thing that can be guaranteed is that the next Australian Capital Territory election will take just as long to bring to a conclusion as this one did. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Australian Electoral Commission on its report. It is a full report. It describes in detail the major tasks performed on behalf of the community. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council on its annual report and on its efforts to identify and investigate problems facing the industry and then to develop recommendations and guidelines to help correct those problems. As I read the report I noted particularly the work of the Council in looking at the issue of mutton marketing. The report noted:</PARA>
<PARA> This is considered timely . . . because . . . the continuing increase in the Australian sheep flock is creating potential for significantly increased levels of turn-off of adult sheep. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also noted:</PARA>
<PARA> It is certain that with a break in season or wool prices, or both, major problems will arise, centring around viable markets for an increased turn-off of what many customers perceive to be low-quality, low-value meat product. Conversely, with the retention of flock numbers, some processors presently are facing economic difficulties in terms of maintaining throughput. </PARA>
<PARA>This study is especially relevant today in light of the recent troubles with the export of live sheep to the Middle East. At a time when more sheep are available for slaughter, the lack of Government action in securing the seven million annual live sheep trade has resulted in a dramatic reduction in auction prices for that type of sheep. The lack of urgency on the part of the Government to solve this problem could cost Australia $150m in export income. The failure of senior Ministers, and especially the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), to seriously address the crisis can be described only as a gross dereliction of duty and has allowed the Saudis to treat Australia with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia cannot maintain strong and viable markets, this serves only to further push Australia's farmers into the abyss of debt which is now facing many of them. Only today we read of disturbing figures which show that farmers are losing money fast, with costs increasing at twice the rate of their income. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics' September quarter index shows an average of a 1.2 per cent increase on prices received, or income, whereas this was heavily outweighed by a 2.1 per cent increase in the prices paid. </PARA>
<PARA> This has happened under a Labor Government which then has the effrontery to claim that farmers are pleased with the Federal Government. I do not know what criteria the Government would use for such a claim, but I can assure honourable senators that if their income was being steadily eroded at a rate where the costs to earn the income were twice the rate of the actual income, if they are thinking Australians they would know that they were going backwards and would not be too happy with that. I do not believe that any of the senators opposite would be happy to see their income eroding in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only assume that somehow the Government is trying to fool the Australian people just as much as its bedfellows in the Queensland Labor Party are currently doing. It is important that everyone, especially the voters in Queensland at the present time, remember what havoc and devastation the Australian Labor Party can cause to industry, whether it is rural, manufacturing or tourism. When one considers the high interest rates and the problems they are causing small businesses and rural people, who play a tremendous part in Australia's balance of payment figures, I believe that they have been having a very hard trot. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some of the points that should be kept in mind when considering the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council annual report. There is no doubt of the importance of the policy council and its work. I commend it for the tremendous job it is doing to identify and help find the solutions with what I might add is little support from the Labor Party and its union-controlled Government to many of the problems facing the livestock industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to congratulate the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council (AMLIPC) on its report and on the excellent summary of the work that it has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the meat industry is one of Australia's major industries and, as such, it has the capacity to make a lot of impact on Australia's balance of payments. It is one of those industries that seem to be taken for granted. Everybody simply believes that the meat industry can keep on going and solve the problems. That is not quite the case. After reading this and various other documents, it is clear that the meat industry is subject to two things: firstly, it has to provide exactly what every customer we can find really wants; and, secondly, we must see how to get a better price or more value added for the products we sell and, conversely, how to go about reducing the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be an action plan built around these two particular factors, and I am pleased that attention has been given in the report to various aspects of these two matters. The first matter, providing what the customer wants, comes back to a matter of breeding, feeding, management, transport and processing-all those things. The second matter, how to get a better price, involves looking to Australia's markets and seeing how we can on-process, where we can establish better markets than the ones we have, and generally trying to merchandise the products in a better fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, we must look at how to go about reducing the costs to a reasonable level. The costs of the meat industry are astronomical. It was only recently in the Estimates debate in this section that the numbers of people who are being paid for not working and the amount of money that is shuffled backwards and forwards between the various sections were discovered. Everyone has welcomed the rationalisation of the processing industry and the improved mechanisation that has gone with it. The CALM process of marketing-computer aided livestock marketing-has provided enormous reductions in costs already and in a reduction of damage losses, but there are still further production savings that we can make and that will be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMLIPC is performing a most valuable function and I hope that its investigations will lead to further extension of the value adding nature of the products involved. It was only lunchtime today when we were having a discussion with a group of gentlemen in the meat merchandising game who have been overseas. They have come back and said that Australia certainly has to lift its game. We must make sure that we are providing what the market requires, and these gentlemen do not think that this is happening now. They also said that we need to change the grading system that we have accepted. The Ausmeat system does not help us and Australia needs to go onto a scheme that is universally accepted. The American scheme is clearly the one that the world sets its pattern by. If Australia wants to achieve ready acceptance on the international markets, it will have to be by the acceptance of the United States scheme. I would honestly recommend to the Council that it again look at this matter and make recommendations to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation that we should change in that direction. </PARA>

<PARA> This comes on top of quite a few other similar committees that abound in this country. To name just a few, as we are already aware, there are the State Animal Welfare Advisory Councils. Under the auspices of the Australian Agricultural Council, there are sub-committees on animal welfare, and in this particular report they actually recommend codes of practice for the welfare of sheep and the capture and welfare of feral animals. The report makes reference to a code of practice for the farming of deer, the welfare of animals at saleyards, the welfare of goats, and the intensive husbandry of rabbits. This is the sort of work done by this advisory council sub-committee of the Standing Committee on Animal Health under the auspices of the Australian Agricultural Council. In the paper they express concern about the establishment of another welfare committee because they are of the view-and so am I-that enough committees exist already. Perhaps this particular body, which represents all States, should have been used to achieve what the Commonwealth was trying to come up with. We also have the Joint Animal Welfare Committee, which is made up of animal welfare committees around the States. We have the State Committee on Animal Welfare. We also have the Australian Council for Care and Research and Training-</PARA>

Having seen the first agenda, I can see why: that concern was caused by the amount of business they seem to have.

At the conclusion of this speech it is my intention to put a question on notice to find out exactly that. At a time when we have learned some new traits because we do not have aeroplanes flying, even though there is not a dispute, I want to suggest that these things could be run much more efficiently and just as effectively with a telephone conferencing system. This is a wonderful scheme that has been available for some years, but it does not replace the joys of the junkets that go with these types of conferences. Much of the work that is done at these conferences is the consideration of prepared papers and the acceptance or amendment of them. Of course, there are advantages in meeting socially, but I question the value.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1988 the Senate referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, for inquiry and report, the social and fiduciary duties and obligations of company directors. This matter must be placed in the context of today's corporate culture. Our corporate culture is not that of a century ago, from which much of the law concerning company directors evolved. Over that period there has been an ever increasing separation between the ownership and control of companies. In 1932 Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, in The Modern Corporation and Private Property, a classic work, analysed the widening chasm between directors, managers and shareholders. As a result, shareholders lost the ability to control the corporations in which they had invested. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporation has become a major social institution. It is now a structure which allows a small number of directors control over huge shareholder funds. Today, boards have great power over vast assets. They pursue more with vigour through takeovers, mergers and buy-outs. At the same time, advances in technology have transformed old industries, engendered new ones and enabled trading in securities to be world wide and rapid. </PARA>
<PARA> The modern corporate sector has a profound effect on our life. It is crucial to the creation of the nation's wealth. Society looks to it to produce that wealth ethically and in accordance with community values. Directors are the mind and soul of the corporate sector. They are crucial to how its great power is exercised. They can weaken and even suppress markets. They can disturb and destroy an environment. Their actions can have a profound effect on the lives of the shareholders, employees, creditors and the public generally. A legal framework has developed regulating companies' incorporation and providing a mechanism for their winding-up, laying down standards of conduct for their officers, protecting shareholders and regulating how they may merge and be taken over. </PARA>
<PARA> There will always be a need for a legal framework such as this, but the extent to which the law will need to intervene in the corporate sector beyond providing this framework depends on the degree to which the corporate sector can effectively regulate itself. Ideally, company directors' conduct should be informed by high ethical values. Corporate history confirms that, without ethics, self-regulation will fail. Courts and legislatures will need to step in when ethical standards are too low or when they are not met. </PARA>
<PARA> Laws regulating the director's role have arisen from the intrinsic nature of the company. For the most part, directors are enjoined to act in the best interests of the company. In other words, the board of directors is required, first and foremost, to have regard to the shareholders' interests. In some respects, the law also deals with directors' duties to their employees. This law has developed out of the relationship the company has with entities extrinsic to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Should the law, as it deals with matters intrinsic and extrinsic to the corporation, be extended? Some say it should. Some say that companies are now so dominated by directors that their owners, the shareholders, are denied an effective say in their control. Some argue that the law should move to meet the reality that the corporate sector is central not only to the economic well-being of society but also to most dimensions of community life. They advocate the imposition of wider duties on directors-that is, directors should be required to consider the interests of the community at large, or various groups within it, in administering companies. In this way, the control of the company would become a balancing of a variety of claims rather than being focused on the interests of its investors. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining these issues, the Committee has looked at the role of the directors as members of a board and at the division of power between the board and the shareholders. It has considered whether directors should be required to have certain qualifications or experience. It has looked at how the law is enforced, and at the remedies available to those who are wronged by directors. It has also considered the question of self-regulation by company directors. In its report the Committee has aimed to deal not with extraordinary situations that might arise but with the everyday situation in which every company director finds himself or herself. Directors should take their role as one of vital importance. As far as the Committee is concerned, the days of the status or figurehead director are over. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee takes the view that, in general, it is appropriate that directors' primary duties and responsibilities lie with the company, as company law presently provides. Other interests, such as those of consumers or the environment, should be dealt with in legislation other than company law. However, given the range of legislation that already imposes obligations on directors towards their employees, it seemed only reasonable to the Committee that the companies legislation be amended to reflect this situation. It has recommended that the companies legislation make it clear that directors are entitled to take into account the interests of employees in administering the company. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from just a glance at recent newspapers and business journals that some directors are not conducting themselves properly and that, too often, shareholders are unhappy with the leadership of their companies. The law already sets out general principles to guide directors. Some are set out in legislation-such as section 229 of the Companies Code-and some exist as general principles which have been developed by the courts over the years. The Committee has considered the adequacy of the present state of the law and has asked whether any inadequacies can be met by more law. It has concluded that, to the extent that company directors themselves can develop a general code of ethics to inform their conduct, they should do so. Neither case law nor legislation can ensure moral behaviour, and it is moral behaviour that the community is entitled to expect. The Committee has recommended that company directors' professional associations take steps to develop and promote a code of ethics for company directors. Peer pressure is a powerful force and, in this way, it can be harnessed by company directors. </PARA>
<PARA> However, history shows that self-regulation has not been completely successful in the corporate sphere. To the extent that it fails, the legislature and the courts must step in and ensure that minimum requirements of behaviour are set out. Company directors must take their role seriously and act responsibly. They should be required to attend board meetings, the extent to which they can rely on others should be limited and the extent to which they can be exonerated from what would otherwise be breaches of their duties should also be limited. The Committee sees no place for appointments to boards as mere window-dressing and its recommendations aim to ensure that window-dressing would not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends that an objective duty of care for directors be set out in the legislation. Over the years, company law has required little of directors. The courts have been concerned to allow for flexibility and not to hamper entrepreneurship unduly, but the law has, to some extent, been outstripped by the pace of development of modern business. Although the diversity of corporate activity makes it difficult to lay down standards that must be met equally by all directors, if the modern company director wants professional status, then an objective standard of care should apply as in other professions. Certainly modern business practice has developed to the point where the community expects such standards. The law should reflect this.</PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with an objective duty of care, the Committee has recommended that a business judgment rule be introduced. The business judgment rule would allow room for directors' informed business judgments and thus would stimulate proper innovation and risk-taking in the corporate sector. This kind of rule has been developed by American courts, although it has been little discussed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has considered the system of internal controls within companies and the division of power between directors and shareholders. The evidence before the Committee showed that many large companies have already set up audit committees. It has recommended the introduction of audit committees as a requirement for public listing. An audit committee would be a committee of the board and would assist the board in dealing with financial information and would help ensure the existence of effective accounting and financial controls. The establishment of an audit committee will help directors take the conscious and active role in the company's affairs that the Committee thinks necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received many submissions to the effect that the law was adequate but that its enforcement was not. Indeed, the efficacy of some existing provisions-for example, section 574 of the Companies Code which provides injunctive relief-remains to be tested. It is only when bodies such as the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) are funded properly and are operating to their limits that the full effect of the law as it stands will be seen. No amount of change in the law will be of any effect unless the law is enforced. The Committee has recommended that the various bodies set up to oversee corporate activity, such as the NCSC and the ASC) be adequately funded so that they will function effectively and will not be toothless tigers. These bodies must not only be capable of operating effectively but also be seen to be operating effectively. This will occur when they are able to acquire and retain staff of the highest calibre and run an adequate number of test cases and implement the law to its fullest extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers it appropriate that there be a range of penalties available to meet the range of breaches that might occur, but criminal penalties are not appropriate in the absence of criminality. It has recommended that the companies legislation be amended, where necessary, so that this does not occur. It has recommended that civil penalties be provided in the companies legislation for breaches which do not involve criminality. It has recommended that a system of on-the-spot fines, such as the Victorian PERIN system, be introduced for minor offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Company directors may be held responsible for the wrongs of their companies. Sometimes this occurs because of specific statutory provisions which impose personal liability on directors; at other times it occurs as a matter of prosecution practice. It seems to the Committee, however, that there is a lack of policy behind decisions to impose personal liability for corporate misconduct and that often little thought is given to how future misconduct could best be prevented. A detailed study of the relevant factors is required before principles regarding the appropriate mix of corporate and individual liability can be set out. The Committee has identified some of the relevant factors but has recommended that this matter be examined in greater detail by a body such as the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to extend the thanks of the Committee to all who made submissions, both written and oral, to the Committee. The Committee recognises that the majority of company directors do their jobs honourably but, clearly, there is presently a need to set standards in the corporate sector. It shares the widespread concern that such standards not be unrealistic or inflexible. The recommendations made in this report are made on that basis. The recommendations on ethical conduct are made on that basis as well. Ethics is simply a mix of experience with morality. If morality is added to the experience of those in the boardroom, hopefully a set of ethics will develop. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all members of the Committee. They all gave great attention to the report. I especially thank the staff, particularly, Kathleen Gibson, Geoffrey Kennett, Stephen Argument and Bronwyn McNaughton-the Secretary-for their learning, dedication, skill and patience. This report is very much a product of their outstanding work. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

It is impossible not to be impressed by the report which has been brought down and impossible not to listen with great interest to Senator Cooney's statement on company directors' duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intervene only briefly to draw the attention of the Senate to an interesting address on the same subject delivered on 8 November-that is, well after the report would have been settled-by Mr R. J. Fynmore, a senior executive of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, on the subject of regulation in Australia-a corporate view. In light of Senator Cooney's last remarks, it is interesting that Mr Fynmore spent part of his time talking under the subheading `Entrepreneurism-The Unacceptable Australian Face' in which he addressed specifically some of the issues of ethics and morality and some of the failures in this area which lead him to take a view of regulation, which is what one might call a middle of the road view, saying that we need adequate regulation and that there have been some examples where people have failed to behave ethically or morally partly because regulation has not been adequate. His paper talks about business regulation and addresses some of the problems in the public sector. I quote from one part of his paper:</PARA>
<PARA> The business community has an obvious interest in regulation which lays down, as clearly as possible, the framework or rules within which business can be carried on; which leaves firms free to judge how they should best conduct themselves within that framework; and which provides a fair measure of certainty or predictability as to the outcome in particular cases; the identity of the responsible regulatory authority should be clear, and that authority should be accountable for its actions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the views he expresses are quite consonant with the views which Senator Cooney has expressed. The paper is quite relevant to the work that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has done. It would not have been available to the Committee as it was delivered only on 8 November. For the information of honourable senators I seek leave of the Senate to table the paper. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I need that, Senator. The inquiry came about because of some highly publicised cases which disclosed apparent abuses of responsibility by directors for which it appeared that there was no effective recourse. That motivated the Senate, through its Committee, to look again at the whole subject of company directors' duties, to look at whether the law required reform or whether the application of the law required to be changed in some way. Those who are interested in this area of the law-I trust that the Government is-will find the Committee's report useful. It is fair to say that it is couched in sensible terms and with sensible recommendations rather than the somewhat sensational contribution that we find elsewhere in this area of the law. As all Senate committees do, we took the reference seriously. I believe that there are recommendations in the report that will be found to be particularly useful over a period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously there are areas which we decided not to cover because they had been dealt with or were being dealt with by other bodies, such as the issue of indemnification of directors and alternate and nominee directors, which have been examined recently by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. What we decided to concentrate on were the questions of qualifications of directors; multiplicity of directorships; the role of directors and composition of the board, including board members and especially audit committees; the nature of directors' existing duties and responsibilities and the standards required; to whom the duties and responsibilities are owed and whether they should be widened; and enforcement of the laws relating to directors. There is an extensive discussion in the report of the ways in which duties are imposed on directors by the courts and by legislation as well as through self-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The courts historically have been reluctant to intervene in the management decisions of companies or to extend the duties of care, skill and diligence which directors owe to a company, and we review the leading cases in the report. I believe that that review will be useful for students of the law. A wide range of obligations is imposed on directors by legislation. They include duties relating to areas such as tax, trade practices and industrial relations. The principal obligation is contained in section 229 of the Companies Code and its equivalent in the new corporations legislation. In this section a duty is imposed on a director to act honestly, to exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence, and not to make improper use of his or her position. Although on its face this looks to be an objective standard of care, in fact, the courts in practice have read it down. It does not add anything to the common law subjective standard where the courts look at what would be reasonable for a particular director in the particular circumstances. There are many more duties and responsibilities in the code: for example, those relating to record keeping and auditing, amounting to what is often described-and certainly this was put to us-as a bewildering array. That becomes important because we received many submissions from directors, directors' organisations and companies stating that the obligation upon directors had become onerous and, in some ways, almost unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report points out, it is not easy to determine uniform minimum standards of behaviour for company directors because of the diversity of modern companies and the flexibility which is necessary to run them. The Committee, while recognising the need for that flexibility, came to the view that the present state of the law is not satisfactory and has recommended that the companies legislation provide for an objective duty of care. As something of a balance, the Committee has also recommended the introduction of what has been referred to in the American courts as a business judgment rule. Where such a rule is in operation there is special protection from liability for directors who make business judgments in good faith provided they act with a reasonable degree of care. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting characteristics of the report, I suggest, is the commonsense nature of many of the recommendations. I refer, for example, to the recommendation that directors be required to attend board meetings-not something that is necessary under the common law. We suggest that directors should be required to attend board meetings unless there is a reasonable excuse for non-attendance. This recommendation leads to what I hope will be seen as an interesting discussion on the controversial issue of figurehead directors. We do not go as far as to recommend an end to the appointment of figurehead directors, although it might be said that some of our recommendations are leading in that direction. The practice of appointing figurehead directors does not seem to be particularly widespread in Australia. Therefore, we resisted the temptation and the suggestion of some submissions that it should be outlawed. But we do not find it unreasonable to expect that a director will actively contribute to the running of a company. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 4 of the report is a comprehensive discussion of directors' fiduciary duties. The issue of multiple directorships is relevant, as conflicts of interest may arise where a person is a director of more than one company and such conflicts may breach fiduciary law. The general tenor of submissions made to the Committee was that the ethical considerations arising from multiple directorships are more properly dealt with by directors' professional associations than by setting some arbitrary limit on the number of positions which may be held, and we accepted that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue arising in the context of fiduciary law is that of disclosure by fiduciaries of their activities so that a beneficiary can make an informed decision about them. The report acknowledges the difficulty of formulating a general rule about when disclosure is necessary and to whom, but it nevertheless makes the recommendation that there be a general rule in the legislation setting out requirements which must be met for exoneration of directors from what otherwise would be breaches of their fiduciary duties. The recommendation may be seen by some as somewhat controversial and it will be interesting to see what debate follows within legal circles. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 5 of the report deals with directors' wider duties, in particular, the question of duties owed to creditors. Once again we hope that students of the law will find the discussion of the case law both comprehensive and useful. Consideration of those cases seems to indicate a duty on directors of insolvent companies to act in the interests of creditors. It is not clear whether this extends to directors of solvent companies. Under the provisions of the corporations legislation, directors are personally liable for debts incurred when there are no reasonable grounds to expect that they will be paid. Although obviously on its face this is a good idea, it has been criticised because each creditor must bring an action to recover the amount that is owing to him, which means it is useful only to those creditors who have the resources to bring an action and those who get in first may clean out the assets of the debtor. Therefore, we recommend in our report that the legislation be amended to provide for all creditors to share equally in sums recovered from directors. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also deals with the duties which have been imposed on company directors by the courts and by legislation in relation to areas external to the company itself, such as conditions of service for employees, occupational health and safety and environmental protection-areas that were of particular interest to the Chairman, Senator Cooney. There was some discussion of the potentially competing interests of shareholders and employees-an area of the law not yet well advanced in this country. The Committee recommends that, in line with prevailing community thought, companies legislation should be amended to clarify the power of directors to take employees' interests into account in administering the company. Duties are also imposed on company directors by environmental and consumer law. The Committee came to the view that these issues are best dealt with in specific legislation rather than in companies legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As was mentioned by Senator Cooney, the Committee also looked in some depth at the question of audit committees and made detailed recommendations on this issue. The presence of an audit committee has several major advantages for a company, not the least of which is enhanced quality of financial reports; at least, we hope that would occur. The Committee was of the view that all publicly listed companies should have an audit committee comprising non-executive directors. On the question of the qualifications of directors, it was common ground that it would not be feasible or practical to require any formal qualifications of skill or experience. As many witnesses pointed out to the Committee, to put a formal requirement in place would be to disqualify many present and potential competent directors. The Committee instead recommended that the Company Directors Association of Australia and the Institute of Directors in Australia compile an index of courses and programs dealing with company directors' duties and responsibilities and that they encourage participation in these courses. In order to make public companies more accountable for their choices of directors, the Committee recommended that the boards state in the annual reports the particular skills and expertise that each director brings to the company. If that recommendation is adopted, some interesting consequences might follow. </PARA>
<PARA> In emphasising regulation by legislation and by the courts, we should not forget that many aspects of company directors' duties and responsibilities are best dealt with by self-regulation through a code of ethics. The Committee recommended that company directors' professional associations develop and promote such a code. The Committee also makes the obvious point that all these means of regulations do not count for much if proper mechanisms for enforcement are not in place. Considerable concern was expressed at the hearings that regulatory bodies such as the National Companies and Securities Commission do not receive sufficient funding to be fully effective. For what it is worth-because it depends on the will of government and we have not seen great will from the Government in this area-we recommend that such agencies receive an adequate level of funding. The final recommendations in the report relate to sanctions against directors for breaches of their duties. Basically, we say that breaches should attract criminal penalties only where the conduct is criminal in nature. There has tended to be some extension towards criminal penalties that might be imposed upon directors who innocently breach provisions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who read and study the report will find it a cautious one. I hope they will find it a useful contribution to law reform in this area. Soon after commencing the report it became apparent to us that it is not possible to legislate for the worst case scenarios. No law will stop those who have no intention of complying with legislative requirements. We tried to make constructive and useful suggestions to reform the existing law so that at least those who wish to comply with their legal obligations might have those obligations more explicitly pointed out to them in the legislation and so that, in effect, the law might be updated to meet the needs of the modern corporate society. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a couple of additional points I would like to raise with the Minister in the consideration of the appropriation for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. They follow on, though are separate and different issues, from the ones we were discussing before lunch today. The first point I want to raise relates to the fact that emerged-for the first time to my knowledge-during the Estimates debate in September about who meets the cost of citizenship ceremonies which are conducted by local councils. As I understand it, most of the citizenship ceremonies are so conducted. I was interested and, I must say, surprised to learn that the Federal Department does not make any contribution at all to the cost of staging those citizenship ceremonies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister, particularly in view of the Year of Citizenship that we have had and the Government's drive to increase the number of Australian citizens, whether he considers that it is a matter that we ought to have a look at. If all of the cost is being borne by local government-as I raised, on behalf of Senator Peter Baume and others during the Estimates Committee hearings, the cost to local government is increasingly onerous-I would like to know, following that discussion in the Estimates Committee, whether the Minister has had an opportunity to think any more about that matter. Also I would like to know whether the Federal Department ought to be looking at making some contribution as part of the overall effort of increasing the status and stature attached to gaining citizenship in Australia, which is a goal to which we all aspire. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be wrong to say that the Commonwealth makes no contribution to citizenship ceremonies. We do not make a direct contribution but the Commonwealth makes funds available to local government per se. I would have thought that in the assessment of making those funds available, one takes into account some things that local government does on behalf of the Federal Government. Senator Short would know the sorts of financial grants that are made to local government authorities. That is the first point I would like to make. Secondly, these people who are becoming citizens are not only Australian citizens voting in Federal elections, they also have a State and a municipal role. I have had very few councils actually complain to me about the cost of running these citizenship ceremonies; some have though.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think another point to make is that most councils enjoy this particular thing and do not mind paying for it. Councils enjoy playing this particular role. It has probably become onerous on a couple of councils. The Brisbane City Council, for instance, at one stage had to conduct very large ceremonies. But I think that Council has broken the areas into wards which is a much better idea as there is no need to have 700 participants at the one time. As I say, I have not had a lot of complaints from councils. The next point is that I would have thought it was part of the councils' compact with the Federal Government that they do this as their duty. In return, that is taken into account when money is allocated to local government. I agree that money is not specifically allocated for citizenship ceremonies. In the same way, the Grants Commission takes into account certain things that States do for the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If, however, we were to look at funding local government-I do not rule it out entirely-in common with that also would be some more direction. One of the problems that Senator Short and many other politicians have raised with me is that councils from time to time take it on themselves to be very selective in their invitation list when Federal and State politicians attend. I have examples of complaints of political bias both ways on that issue. If I were asked whether I would fund all the citizenship ceremonies, in that case I think I would bypass local councils and design the citizenship ceremonies myself and run them in my own way. If it becomes a problem it should be looked at. I do not see it as a major problem at the moment. It may be that local councils have not written to complain because they regard it as inevitable. Having attended I do not know how many in the last year, I noticed that all the councils seem very enthusiastic to retain their control. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that if I delegate someone else in an area to perform a ceremony-from time to time I delegate people from both sides of the chamber to carry out a special, one-off ceremony just for a day, it could be the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or it could be my colleague Senator Calvert on the other side of the chamber who did one in Hobart-the councils tend to write to me to complain about that. They say that it is their right to conduct the ceremonies. So I do not see this matter as a big problem. If Senator Short has received a lot of complaints I ask that he forward them on to me and I will give them due consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good; I welcome that. I think it is a very good move. As a point of principle, if we as a Federal government place a lot of weight on Australian citizenship-I think rightly so and we do on both sides of the chamber and of politics-it raises the question of whether we ought to be looking at making some contribution towards the cost of the appropriate ceremonies. I do not push the matter. If the Minister says that local government has not raised the issue in any marked degree, perhaps the problem is not there to the extent that it might appear to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other matter I want to raise in relation to this Department is a specific case. It is one that concerns me because I think it has a wider implication for the whole question of the treatment of over-stayed or illegal immigrants. That relates to the case of a Mr Kandasamy, who was previously known as Mr Damieen. I raised a question on notice in the Estimates Committee hearing. I did get a response. My question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Has Mr R. Kandasamy . . . been deported yet? If so, when? If not, what is the status of his appeal? When is the decision expected to be made?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply I got was:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kandasamy has not been deported. He has applied for resident status. Enquiries relating to his claims for resident status, which have been complicated by changing circumstances, are continuing and should be completed shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I raise the matter and express concern about the answer-it is perhaps part of a wider question in terms of how we handle overstayed immigrants-is that this matter, as I understand it, has been going on since October 1986 when this man first applied for permanent resident status. My understanding of the background of this case is that he is Malaysian by birth. He came to Sydney about 12 years ago on a visitors visa for six months. He overstayed the visa and he became too frightened to approach the authorities to explain the situation. In Melbourne he met an Aboriginal person in an hotel in Fitzroy who gave him some documentation in the name of another Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA> The fellow then got a job in Melbourne with the Tramways Board as a conductor, and he worked there for 13 months. Then he did some study. He had a serious accident causing him to be hospitalised for many months, and whilst in hospital he met a person whom he married. They had two children, and they are now divorced. He then went to Darwin and got a passport in the name of the Aborigine. He went back to Malaysia for a two-week holiday. He came back to Australia and worked as an inventory clerk in the Department of Defence at Laverton. I understand that whilst he was there the team from the Mike Willessee show raided his home and accused him of falsifying his identity to arrange particular ventures in Australia. He was imprisoned for five months and fined $2,000 before applying for an Australian passport without being an Australian. Therefore, he was an illegal immigrant. That is the background information that I have been given on the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that it has taken more than three years to determine his application for permanent resident status. I would like to know more about why a case like that takes so long and what the implications are in the broader nature for the whole question of the examination of overstayed and admitted illegal immigrants in Australia. If it is going to take so long to look at applications which would appear prima facie to be clear-cut-I should not pass judgment on that-it does not surprise me in some ways that we have as many illegal immigrants in Australia as we have. We have to tighten up on that situation-and it is correct that we do so, and there is universal agreement on that. I wonder how we will go in the future unless we lift our game. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no intention of discussing the specific details of the case without the file in front of me. Senator Short has raised some very valid general points. It is interesting that the honourable senator mentioned that this man was a tram driver. One of the things he could have done was drive a tram through the Migration Act. The one we are operating under today was passed in 1958. It has been so reinterpreted by the courts-I am not necessarily saying that it is the reason in this particular case-right up to the High Court of Australia, that it can be a very slow process determining someone's status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, Mr X, whoever he is, could apply for a change of resident status in this country under the existing law under the employer nomination scheme. He may miss out there. He may then apply on compassionate grounds. He may miss out there. Then he may apply for refugee status. All these things take a long while to resolve. Every step has to be dealt with very carefully because if officers do not give due consideration to every aspect of the application we find the courts remitting the decision back for further decision. Under the new Act that is to be proclaimed on 19 December, when one appeals on one ground one appeals on all grounds other than the refugee status. So one is considered on all claims. That will shorten the process. More important than that, following 19 December if one is here as an illegal immigrant one is subject to a mandatory deportation order following the issue of which one has two working days in which to make any other claims, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to face a revolution on 19 December. I appreciated the support from most people in this chamber for toughening up these particular areas. It is long overdue. Senator Short can blame this Government for not doing it in the last six years and I will blame his Government for not doing it in the previous seven years. He can blame my Government for not doing it in the previous three years and we will be back into the Gorton and McMahon periods through to the Menzies reign. These problems have been building because of the treatment meted out and the length of time taken in dealing with these cases. The real thing to consider is that when we extend the length of time a person stays in Australia we are giving a great privilege to that person. Any time the time is extended overseas we are giving a penalty to someone overseas. The whole thrust of the new Migration Act this year was to reverse the situation and to have these things dealt with promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be happy to examine the specific case and talk to Senator Short privately about it, having the full file details in front of me-which I do not have at the moment. That is not surprising with the thousands of cases going at any one time. The points he makes about the delays are valid. We need to overcome them because unless we have quick justice in this area to some extent we are giving a massive advantage to someone who has stayed here illegally while other people are queued up orderly overseas. Maybe I am being an optimist when I say that the new Act will drastically alter the situation. I guess the proof of the pudding will be in the eating next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a tough one. I qualify this by saying that a mandatory deportation order would be issued after a period of time. Once a person had an illegal status there would be a mandatory deportation order against that person. I think that the person would be on apprehension-I will have to check this-and would have two days to make any further claims of changed circumstances or anything else. Other than that, that mandatory deportation order is irreversible, by me or the courts, as I understand the Act. We cannot interfere with that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee, having considered the Report of Estimates Committee E, recommends-That the following matters be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry and report on or before the last sitting day in May 1990, bearing in mind the functions and purposes of the Senate Estimates Committees:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the adequacy of the present format of departmental explanatory notes and monitoring by the Department of Finance to ensure that departments comply with the format set out in its memoranda;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the need for any change to existing procedures of the Senate to ensure that the activities of government service providers operating through Trust Accounts do not escape adequate scrutiny; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the need for any change to existing procedures of the Senate to ensure that Special Appropriations and bodies funded through such appropriations do not escape adequate scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (a) of the motion is a matter of ongoing concern. Materials provided to Estimates committees should be sufficient for senators on those Estimates committees to make judgments about the proposed expenditure and how well a department is meeting its stated objectives. The move to program budgeting is welcomed in this respect and should make the task of making such assessments easier. It is probably true to say that departments have needed time to settle down to the new reporting format, but the result has been patchy, and this is identified in the report. I will not go into it here, except to say that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs deserves particular praise for giving what the Committee thought were very clear reports throughout, whereas the reports of other departments were quite patchy. The Department of Finance is held partly responsible for this, so we thought it prudent to recommend that it look at the procedures and that they apply to departments in that reporting process. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (b) of the motion arose out of changes occurring within the Department of Administrative Services. A number of programs providing services to other departments are currently undergoing a process of commercialisation. Instead of being directly funded by appropriations, funds are being provided to departments so that they may, in turn, pay the service providers. These payments are being placed in trust accounts under the Audit Act. Some concern was expressed by senators on the Committee that the process might diminish the scrutiny by the Estimates committee. While I guess the problem has been exacerbated by the transition period that that process is in, we are assured that financial statements will include full details, as with any business, in the annual reports of the departments. Nevertheless, it was felt prudent to refer that question to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration so that it can examine the processes necessary to achieve proper scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of the motion arose out of consideration of estimates of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and, in particular, the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account established under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Amounts of money equivalent to certain royalties are paid into an account out of Consolidated Revenue and the costs of the Northern Territory land council administration are met from these funds. The question arises whether it is appropriate for questions to be asked in the Estimates Committee in relation to the account in the first place and the land councils in the second place, neither of which receive funds directly through the estimates. The question also arose about whether the Estimates Committee did have a right to call witnesses from the land councils. Again, that is a question that we felt should be referred to the Finance and Public Administration Committee in order to determine proper procedures for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of Estimates Committee E, I strongly agree with the motion moved by Senator Beahan, the Chairman of the Committee. He explained very clearly the difficulties that we see arising. My friend Senator Tambling raised initially the problems that may arise through the increasing move to use trust accounts in the operation of government agencies and perhaps parts of departments. Whilst I have not had the opportunity to read the recommendations of Estimates Committee E, having listened to Senator Beahan, it is certainly in line with the concerns that we had. I think it is an important issue. Of course, it goes well beyond the ambit of Estimates Committee E; it relates to the whole question of financial operations of government. For that reason, the motion to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is, in my view, very wise. I therefore support the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity that the facilities of the Senate did not enable prior notice of this motion to be given. This motion has only just been brought to my attention. Whilst I appreciate that the motion is a technical formality regarding the issues that were referred to in the Estimates Committee E report, there was no prior notice given to members of the Committee that the motion was going to be brought on at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we discuss the report of Estimates Committee E, naturally a number of these issues across the various portfolios will be addressed, be they from the Department of Administrative Services or the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the various statutory authorities. The issues canvassed in the motion do reflect recommendations that arise from the Committee's report and, as Senator Short has just said, enjoy the support of all members of that Committee. I only briefly heard Senator Beahan speaking to his motion while I was still in my office. He addressed some of the issues that, either later today or tomorrow, I will raise in considerable detail as we proceed through the committee stage. I refer in particular to those of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission, to which the Estimates Committee has given particular attention for quite some considerable time. In fact, going back to October 1988, there has been a continuing saga of a very strong need for scrutiny, review and reports by various committees-not only by Estimates Committee E but by other committees of this Parliament, various inquiries that were instituted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and various reports, including, of course, the Australian Audit Office report. All those things have highlighted for the attention of the chamber some very important deficiencies that have to be noted in this particular portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> In the process of Estimates Committee E a number of activities of the Department of Administrative Services required investigating, particularly those relating to the provision and operation of trust accounts. Therefore, the moving of this motion, that these three matters be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, is timely and proper. I assure the Committee that it will enjoy my support. </PARA>

I also commend him in general for the quality of the report from Estimates Committee E, which is by far the most informative and detailed of any of the reports that have come from Estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress that the matter of trust accounts, as Senator Tambling and Senator Short have said, extends far beyond the area of Estimates Committee E and certainly far beyond the problem that Senator Tambling identified in Aboriginal Affairs. One of the responses I intended to deal with in this debate on the report of Estimates Committee E concerns the Australian Government Publishing Service, which has multi-million dollar trust account operations that, in the absence of appropriate questioning at Senate Estimates committee meetings and the provision of a reply to questions upon notice, would not have been available for public scrutiny under a system that I think certainly needs examination. So I commend Senator Beahan for bringing this about. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the question of whether or not annual reports of statutory bodies which are not at present required to be presented, where possible, to Senate Estimates committees, as departmental reports are, could be brought into the same category as departmental reports. As I mentioned the other day, the Civil Aviation Authority, I think it was, presented a one-line appropriation and, when questioned, said that all the details were in the annual report. When asked where the annual report was, the Authority said that it may be available perhaps in November. We have not seen it yet and we are now debating appropriations, and that strikes me as a particularly bad principle. I wonder whether Senator Beahan feels that that matter is covered. I must say that, had I realised that this was coming forward, I would have had a chat to him to see whether the availability of annual reports of departments could have been included in this change of procedures because they provide a great deal of explanation of the appropriations and performance as against appropriations of the previous year. Paragraph (c) of Senator Beahan's motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA>the need for any change to existing procedures of the Senate to ensure that Special Appropriations and bodies funded through such appropriations do not escape adequate scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that is a compendious enough matter to raise the question of these statutory and other bodies which do not have the same reporting requirement to Senate Estimates committees. In conclusion, I commend Senator Beahan for the motion and say that it has my strong support. </PARA>

They have been without papers of any sort and have all manner of related problems. When some of them put in their applications for citizenship, they found that they had to go through exactly the same process as everybody else. They were shocked to discover this because, having been brought out here as children, not by their parents and without having any say at all in the matter and having regarded themselves as Australians-some of them even fought for this country during the Vietnam war-they really feel that they should have some automatic right to citizenship. They regard themselves as having been brought up in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins in her opening remarks said that these people were applying for British citizenship, so I was confused for a moment. Obviously she meant to say that they were applying for Australian citizenship. The current Act provides very little discretion that would allow me to say that we could foreshorten the normal processes, nor is there any provision for automatic citizenship. Early in the Estimates Committee hearings, I indicated that a review of the Citizenship Act is fairly high on our agenda and is part of our legislative program. A variety of changes will be looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>

We will have a look at it in terms of reviewing the Citizenship Act to see how it can apply to those individuals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to these votes, and I know that that would surprise my Labor colleagues opposite. There are some matters that have interested me and I am certain will interest the chamber. I again commend Senator Beahan for taking up in his report some of the matters that concerned me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One is the question of the extent to which members of departments, senior members of the bureaucracy, should respond to questions asked by senators in Senate Estimates committees. The report of Senate Estimates Committee E noted that, over many years, I had been specifically asking about the extent to which property leased, rented or owned by the Commonwealth had remained unoccupied or significantly underutilised for any length of time in any financial year since 1982-83. The response from the Australian Construction Services was that there were no properties currently unoccupied or significantly underutilised. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out at the time, the Auditor-General in his audit report No. 15 for  1989-90 drew attention to the fact that the Australian Construction Services facility in Kewdale in Western Australia was underutilised and that that had been apparent since at least 1982, which was in the period covered by my question. The response I got when I compared the Auditor-General's view with the Department's view was that there was a little confusion about the words `significantly underutilised'. It is worth quoting the report of the Committee in this respect. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Auditor-General's findings were raised at this Committee's hearing, the Departmental officers attempted to defend the answer they gave on the basis that they had attached a particular meaning to the adverb `significantly' which somehow excluded the underutilisation that had taken place at Kewdale. As the Minister at the Table, Senator Ray, remarked, . . . the important lessons for Departments to draw from this instance is that they should give the fullest answer possible to a Senator's question, rather than relying on a restrictive interpretation of the wording used in the question to deny the Senator the information which he or she may have been seeking. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Minister for his very reasonable response at that time, but the matter that concerns me is whether there are other instances within the Commonwealth Public Service-which is in charge of multi-millions of dollars worth of assets-where other departmental officers may have taken the view that because in their view, something may not be `significantly' underutilised, it is therefore not `significantly underutilised' in the view of a reasonable person. I suggest that clearly the Auditor-General's report does raise a few questions and makes one a little uneasy about the merit of some of the answers that we may have been getting. </PARA>
<PARA> At times many members of the bureaucracy may feel that senators are unfairly hectoring them in the manner in which they go about asking questions in Senate Estimates committees. There is no doubt that there are some budding Perry Masons on the Opposition benches who enjoy seeking to make some strong points. The fact is that if senators have to put up with responses which may well be either intentionally or unintentionally misleading, then it underlines in their minds the need to ask probing and what often may be seen to be harassing questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the atmosphere in Senate Estimates committees would be at a much better level than that and that there would be a genuine pursuit of knowledge without the feeling that there is an adversarial situation. Theoretically, we should all be in there together. In the case of Senator Robert Ray, I can say that on all occasions when participating in Senate Estimates as Minister he participates in such a way as to assist in the discovery of information to which the Senate is entitled. Some Ministers do not do that, but this Minister acts with total propriety in these matters. However, when there is a mixture of a senator-like Senator Bolkus-using his position, in so many instances, it seems, to obstruct the Opposition in the asking of proper questions, and members of the bureaucracy appear-as in this case-to mislead members of the Senate, either intentionally or unintentionally, there will be a bad atmosphere and an atmosphere of hostile questioning in these Estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I am underlining the recommendation from the Minister that departmental officers should take this into account and I am asking departmental officers across the whole spectrum of the Commonwealth Public Service to recognise that the great bulk of Opposition senators-to my knowledge-bear no ill will when they are asking questions of the bureaucracy. However, if we get the feeling that we are being misled and that people are hiding behind particular forms of language in order not to be frank, then it is inevitable that there will be an atmosphere of hostility and reports outlining Senate concern very strongly, as was outlined in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this matter in general, that is, the presentation of full and ready information, may well form part of the sort of inquiry before the Committee on Finance and Public Administration that Senator Beahan has just initiated. There are some matters I wish to raise in general, but I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time right now in case other senators wish to raise issues immediately before we get up for dinner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel inclined to respond to some of the remarks made by Senator Michael Baume. I do not appreciate his putting the kiss of death on Senator Beahan and me, and I might go back to Senator Vanstone's bibliography in which I once referred to Senator Baume in certain ways and repeat them here. But I think it was a fair summation, especially the latter part of it. For one moment I was going to get up and criticise Senator Baume for being one-sided in just criticising public servants, because at some stages in Estimates committees I believe that senators have mistreated public servants in their attitude to them. It is a chicken and egg argument as to why that may occur, but these people are there to assist the Minister. The greatest abuse occurs when senators try to ask public servants for their opinions on policy. They are not there for that reason. It is the old business of bowling five leg-spinners then a wrong'un. They ask five factual questions, establish a rapport, public servants are always trying to help, and then they cop the question on policy grounds. Simply, public servants are not there for that, and the last thing senators opposite would want is them passionately defending government policy, because the moment an election turnaround occurs, they would expect public servants to implement their policies and not have a passionate approach to policy matters. At times it is a difficulty when nascent Perry Masons get loose. Also I must add that there is a responsibility by Ministers and chairmen of committees to intervene where possible and to halt that procedure. I have noticed that when we have intervened, cooperation from senators does ensue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To return to the question of a full and frank answer, I have said that I believe that that should be the case. I would not like anyone to think that I am just a prissy, principled person. I do that out of self-interest because that is the safest approach. One cannot get caught out if one puts in a full and direct answer. One cannot get accused of covering up, and it is the Senate's right. I will conclude on this point: Estimates committees are one of the great institutions of this Parliament. I have often been accused, a la Mae West, of showing contempt for this chamber and, like Mae West, I have always responded by saying, `No, I have always tried to hide it.' The one overriding body that does keep the whole public administration on its toes is the Estimates committee. I agree with not having them in the House of Representatives, because they are a farce anyway, and I would always agree to having them here. I might agree to knocking out a lot of other committees in this chamber that I regard as useless, but we have to acknowledge the fact that Estimates committees are basically there for oppositions, and so it should be. I would hate to see them ever go. </PARA>
<PARA> I can also say in conclusion that anything that has been done to me in Estimates committees was nothing to what I did to others in cahoots with Senator Gietzelt and Senator McLaren in the period 1981 to 1983, and any trick that is currently being played in Estimates committees we certainly played when we were in opposition. I acknowledge the remarks made by Senator Baume, especially the way he balanced them; that it is up to public servants to give full and frank answers and, in turn, to be treated with respect by senators and not simply someone they can take their bad day out on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to say a few words about the passing of a person who I consider a close friend but, more importantly, a very significant political figure of the south and mid Pacific, that of Timoci Bavadra, in Fiji recently. As has been reported in the press, Timoci died from cancer. His passing is a great loss, not just to Fiji but to all of the peoples of the South Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had the opportunity to meet Timoci on a number of occasions, both before he became Prime Minister of Fiji-but never while he was Prime Minister of Fiji-and on a number of occasions after he was deposed in a coup in April 1987. Some features about Timoci Bavadra were unique. Of all the people I have met in politics, I do not think I have met a person who was genuinely more sincere, honest and humble in the way he carried himself in his political work. Some people suggested that he was unsophisticated. If that was a criticism, I think it was a criticism that Timoci bore very gladly. From the meetings that I had with him, I certainly know that that honesty, sincerity and humbleness always came across. That was also, I believe, the reason for his extraordinary support in Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> Timoci was a great democrat and a great statesman. Why I think he deserves those descriptions is that he saw that the only way that Fiji could progress was to break the stereotype of the racial divisions in that country. He was the founding leader of the Fiji Labour Party, the first multi-racial political party formed in Fiji. As I say, he believed that that was the only way Fiji could progress, that it was the only way that the many tensions in the community could be overcome. He was the first politician openly to seek the support of both communities, and he had great success in that. The first time that the Fiji Labour Party contested a general election in that country, it was successful and formed a coalition with the Federation Party. I have no doubt that the coup, which occurred after only 33 days in office, was motivated by the fact that a number of people realised that, if Timoci Bavadra had the chance to govern Fiji for any length of time, he would be successful in creating a balanced, multi-racial society and that that would threaten certain vested interests in that community. </PARA>
<PARA> The unique thing about Timoci Bavadra is that, after he was deposed, despite what I think is the right that he had to be extremely bitter about those circumstances, he never allowed personal feelings of hatred against those who perpetrated the coup against him. He maintained his good humour, his dignity and, above all else, his humanity towards all, although many of us in Australia who were his friends expressed a lot more anger than he did. Again, I think that was a mark of his extraordinary political statesmanship. </PARA>
<PARA> I got to know Timoci Bavadra particularly well when a number of us were involved in forming the Association of South Pacific Progressive Parties in early 1988. The inaugural meeting was held in Melbourne and, at the end of that meeting, Timoci was elected as the first chairman. He was elected unanimously, without any debate or division at all, because all of those representatives of something like eight or nine different countries of the South Pacific realised that he clearly had the stature and the status automatically to become the first chairman. The idea of the Association was to provide a forum for people with views against colonialism in favour of progressive policies to support ordinary people in the various countries of the South Pacific. Timoci Bavadra was an excellent first chairman. Not only will he be greatly missed in his own country of Fiji, but as a member of the Association of South Pacific Progressive Parties, he will be very sorely missed. That is an indication that the South Pacific, as a region, will miss his leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the time of his death and the funeral, it was said that support for him and his Party was declining. I thought that was dispelled by the scenes that we saw in this country at the time of his funeral. It is estimated that, at a minimum, 20,000 people attended his memorial service. It has been estimated that in Fiji as many as 60,000 people attended his funeral-in a country without a large population. The interesting thing about the funeral was that, although it was conducted just outside of Lautoka, on the western side of the main island of Fiji, people came from all over Fiji and from other countries. Again, a mark of that funeral service was the fact that it was multiracial. Not only were there large numbers of Fijians present but also large numbers of Indians. Throughout Fiji most shops and businesses closed as a mark of respect for Timoci Bavadra. It proved that if a free and fair election had been held at any time in Fiji after 1987, even under the 1970 constitution Timoci Bavadra would have been swept back into power. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly offer my condolences to his widow, Aidi Kuini, and the family. I say to Aidi that I hope she will continue to play a role. I think it is most important that she accept the role of becoming, if not the new leader of the Fiji Labour Party, one of its leaders. In her own right she has been an outstanding leader. She will be able to provide the leadership for all of those people in Fiji-and they are not a minority, they are a majority-who want a decent, democratic system. That would, of course, be the final, ultimate tribute to this remarkable man, Timoci Bavadra, who died only two weeks ago. His death is a great tragedy. As I say, I pass on my condolences not only to his immediate family but to all of the people of Fiji whom he worked for and served for so long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the Queensland State election campaign and on some of the less seemly things that are occurring in that State. The leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in Queensland, Mr Wayne Goss, in a slick campaign, is claiming that he is the only person who can deliver clean government in Queensland. It is interesting to note that the campaign is being waged with little or no reference to the Labor Party itself. The State Party does not wish to be associated in any way with the economic disasters imposed on every Queenslander and every Australian by fellow Labor comrades in Canberra: record interest rates, high mortgage rates, continuing high inflation, a frightening debt, all of which are reducing the standards of living of every Queenslander.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other tack being taken by Labor in Queensland is to keep its candidates' past buried. It is about time that this cover-up by Mr Goss was exposed. The State member for Redcliffe is Mr Terry White. It should be recalled by everyone that it was Terry White, as leader of the Liberal Party who, because of his own perceptions of lack of accountability, in 1983 took his Party out of government. This is the only time that this has ever occurred in the history of Australia. He is a man who, by his actions, has shown himself to be someone of integrity and principle. Of course, it was claimed that that move was not politically smart. Maybe it was not; however, when the chips were down, Terry White opted for principles and integrity, something which everyone in Queensland is demanding today. What about the integrity and principles of the State Labor Party and Mr Goss? Mr White has a Labor candidate, Mr Ray Hollis, standing against him. Mr Hollis has already infringed the Electoral Act by distributing material in the Redcliffe electorate and claiming that it has come from the Liberals. He produced a pamphlet, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to only part of the leaflet. After greetings it goes on to discuss why people should vote Labor. At the bottom of the leaflet it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This letter is funded by Liberal supporters who want real change. Authorised by: Frank Bradley, PO Box 217, Carina. </PARA>
<PARA>This leaflet has been distributed by Mr Hollis. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Liberal Party. Frank Bradley is a well-known ALP supporter who regularly hands out how to vote cards for the ALP. He is well-known in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hollis was initially a member of the Liberal Movement in South Australia. In previous elections he stood as an Independent and based his campaign on what was called `a free voice'. In a newspaper article he is quoted as being disillusioned and stating that it was hard to cast a vote for any major party with confidence. Throughout the campaign he was highly critical of the rigid control of the Labor Party by what he called the party hierarchy or the junta. He subsequently stood as a Democrat for the House of Representatives and, again, in 1986 as a Democrat in the Senate. In the previous Redcliffe City Council election he stood for the Labor Party. Having been defeated on all occasions over a number of years, he now pops up as the Labor candidate for Redcliffe. According to complaints from constituents in the Redcliffe electorate, Mr Hollis's campaign is basically being run out of the office of Mr Gary Johns, the Federal member for Petrie, with members of Mr Johns's staff, and with the use of Government paid telephones, eliciting support for Mr Hollis. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that all honourable senators could say that to some extent assistance is given to candidates at various election levels. The reason I am drawing this to the attention of the chamber is to point out the utter hypocrisy of Mr Clean Goss. Here we have Mr Goss portraying a squeaky clean image, running around the State talking about abuse of ministerial expenses and corruption, and yet we have the classic case of the Labor Party using taxpayers' money to fund a State Labor candidate. Mr Goss should come clean and tell the people of Queensland the background of other Labor candidates as well as how many other Mr Hollises there are. The people of Queensland should realise that the State Labor Party and Mr Goss in his glass house are in no position to throw stones. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to bring to the attention of the Senate an injustice affecting my constituents in Western Australia, and one constituent in particular. I am very pleased to note that Senator Cook is here this evening because I think he will be interested in this matter. The general problem relates to one I have raised in the Senate on a previous occasion and that is the treatment of the frail aged in certain nursing homes in my State of Western Australia. I have in my possession a document which details complaints made some time ago about the treatment of patients in a nursing home in Western Australia. I do not seek leave to table this document because the complaints were made some time ago and I understand that the major aspects have been addressed and a new director of nursing has been appointed to that particular nursing home. I understand also that ownership of the nursing home has changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I want to indicate the seriousness of the allegations that were formerly made because they are relevant to what I have to say later. The complaint stated that residents were oversedated and that, as a result of oversedation, some suffered falls with resultant hip and other fractures; that incontinent patients were left for long periods without being cleaned up; that patients who called for bedpans were ignored; that there were no emergency bells in some daytime areas; and that patients in a lounge had no means of attracting attention when one of their number set her rug alight while smoking, which again was the result of being oversedated. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also claims of residents being denied access to religious comfort and advice, of staff shouting at patients to intimidate them, of censorship of patients' mail, of inadequate medical care, of inadequate food, of financial irregularities, of other indignities, and even of active euthanasia. Eventually a staff member who had a strong conscience and who had the welfare of the patients at heart complained to a priest about the treatment of the residents. My information is that the priest then went to the director of nursing and revealed to that person the identity of the complainant, who was then summarily dismissed from the employment of that nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that I want to bring to the attention of the Senate and the Government this evening is that this particular staff member has since applied for a number of positions with other nursing homes and has been unable to obtain a job in the industry. On more than one occasion this person has gained an interview and on one occasion she was told at the conclusion of the interview that she was successful and an appointment would proceed. Subsequently, she was contacted and told quite openly that the appointment could not proceed because she had been blacklisted by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that some weeks ago I made some general statements about Western Australian nursing homes. I am happy to relate that there was a strong and positive response to my speech from the State Department of Community Services and Health. Senior officers of the nursing homes section visited my office and gave a briefing on their responsibility for the maintenance of standards of care and on the investigation procedures, as well as resources which can be applied when complaints are received. An investigation of the complaints that were channelled through my office was then undertaken. I have not yet been informed of the results of the investigation but I have been assured by the Department that, when it is complete, I will be advised of the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this again because on this occasion one of the elements which disturbed me greatly was that staff at the nursing home in question were threatened with dismissal if they should make any complaints to the authorities. They were also told that, if that did happen, they would never work again in the industry. They were clearly given to understand that the private nursing home industry in Perth operates a blacklist and that anyone who blows the whistle in relation to abuses or inadequate standards of care will find himself or herself blacklisted. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 November this year the West Australian published a report on the subject of death threats received in the mail by a psychiatric nurse who earlier this year had given evidence to an inquiry, commissioned by the Western Australian Government, into patient abuse at the Graylands Psychiatric Hospital. This nurse has received a number of veiled death threats, rat poison, a rat trap and two get well cards in the mail. The nurse is reported to have stated that many of the nurses at Graylands who gave evidence to the inquiry have been threatened and intimidated. If there are abuses in nursing homes and other medical institutions, the first people who are likely to become aware of them are staff members, particularly the nursing staff. I am certain that the professional ethical standards of nurses would require them to speak out if they became aware of any abuses or inadequacies in either the medical care given to residents or related areas such as nutrition, occupational therapy, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, in my view, an essential safeguard of industry that staff members should feel free to complain to relevant authorities, without any fear of intimidation, sanction or dismissal. Inadequacies and abuses can easily be hidden from visitors and, in any case, many elderly patients in these nursing homes do not receive visitors. Some aged people either are unable to complain or can easily be intimidated. If nursing and other staff are intimidated by threats of instant dismissal and of being banned from ever working in the industry again, the chances are that abuses will continue unchecked. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, tonight I call on the Government to bite the bullet and to take legislative action on the recommendations of the report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels, which was tabled in the Senate recently. I call on the Government to ensure that, as far as is possible, measures are implemented which impose strong sanctions on any group of employers who collude to black-ban or in other ways punish employees who draw attention to serious inadequacies and abuses in the care of aged and infirm residents in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be interested to hear from Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, whether there is any action that I or the person whose experience I have described can now take to obtain redress and the right not to be discriminated against in respect of future employment in the industry. I fully appreciate that this is a ticklish problem. No-one will easily admit in public that a black list exists, or confirm that any particular name is on it. Nonetheless, I suspect that such a system does operate-these people have indicated that very strongly-and that it is effective in deterring the making of complaints which, although embarrassing and highly inconvenient to management, can have a significant role in protecting elderly and vulnerable people who are not in a position to assert their own rights when they are in these nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today I referred to misrepresentation of the Australian Democrats' policy on immigration in the Italian language newspaper Il Globo on 13 November. The newspaper's comments on the Australian Democrats' policy are inaccurate and offensive. When the editor of the newspaper was asked where he had obtained his information he stated that he had obtained it from Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, and a Special Broadcasting Service television program. </PARA>
<PARA> As spokesperson for the Australian Democrats on immigration, I make it clear that the Australian Democrats have a policy which is firmly based on a preference for compassionate and humanitarian standards with an emphasis on family reunion and Australia's obligation under the international refugee conventions to which we are a signatory. That is a different policy from the illusory `economic' and `factory fodder' model shared by the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. I have made that clear every time I have spoken with the editor of Il Globo, Mr Nino Randazzo. The Australian Democrats have never considered setting a ceiling on immigration in any of these areas. I also make it plain that we believe that the Government should reconsider its policy of continuing to bring in migrants on a skills basis in order to paper over the deep cracks in Australia's neglected educational and training provisions, especially when we have a relatively high level of unemployment in this country. We also have extreme reservations about the business migration scheme as we feel that it has failed to provide any substantial human or economic value to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next week, Canberra will be hosting the largest arms bazaar ever held in the Southern Hemisphere called AIDEX 89. The organisers describe it as the largest and most sophisticated defence high technology exhibition ever held in the Southern Hemisphere but I prefer to call a spade a spade, and, despite mutterings about defensive equipment to justify its existence, I shall refer to it for what it really is, an arms bazaar. Perhaps the Canberra Times defence columnist, Frank Cranston, was more accurate when his column on the subject on 13 October referred to it as a war show.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1986 the organisers of this arms bazaar, the Sydney-based Australia Trade Fair Co., DESIKO, was instrumental in trying to set up a similar event known as PADEX. As this was also the International Year of Peace, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, now elevated to higher office, realised that it was somewhat untimely and, after some huffing and puffing from the nearest that Australia gets to a military-industrial complex, PADEX was called off. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lost out in the long struggle with the Department of Defence and the merchants of death are riding high. They started out with the Cooksey report on the Review of Australia's Defence Co-operation Programs and Policy on Export of Defence Equipment in 1986, which was never tabled or discussed in this Parliament, and which recommended that Australia double its military exports over the next three to five years. Then, starting last year, they got all the rules changed so that more companies could get into the game. Red tape was reduced and, in effect, the controls on which countries we sell to were slackened. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that there are those who would argue that Australia is small fry in the global arms trade-I believe that we rank in thirty-fourth place, according to the most recent set of figures-and that what we are really selling is purely defensive equipment, not the nasty killing stuff. The point I would make in this context is that, although this may be true, modern warfare is not possible without all this other hardware to back up the killing. I have already drawn an analogy with a situation where we might be saying that we are willing to supply the syringes but not the heroin to the addict, knowing that someone else will supply the heroin, because that is precisely our position. </PARA>
<PARA> There are over 200 companies coming to AIDEX 89. Their wares vary from combat clothing to military journals, and from lots of high technology electronic gear to batteries and instruments. Some companies would appear to be promoting the weapons that kill. Some of the names are very familiar to those who track global arms transfers. There is Creusot-Loire from France, British Aerospace, Ferranti International, General Electric (GE) Aerospace, General Dynamics, Honeywell, Marconi Defence Systems, Raytheon, Rockwell Electronics, Siemens, Thomson-CSF, Thorn-EMI Electronics, and Westinghouse Electronic Systems. Several of these come from the United State Defense Department's top hundred military contractors list. General Dynamics brings us Trident submarines and cruise missiles, including the ones which were deployed at Greenham Common in England and which are still deployed on ships such as the USS Bunker Hill and the USS Fife which were in Fremantle harbour last week bearing Tomahawk cruise missiles. </PARA>
<PARA> Honeywell was the target of international protests during the Vietnam War because of its products utilised there by the United States military up to the end of the war in 1975. Rockwell is the maker of the B1 bomber and in 1987 one of its vice-presidents told Jane's Defence Weekly that Australia was to be the springboard for its maritime penetration of the Asia-Pacific region. Both Westinghouse and General Electric make nuclear reactors. General Electric also manufactures components rather than complete weapons systems and there have been problems for the United States through the sale of GE aircraft engines as a result, particularly involving Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Canada will also be represented at AIDEX through its High Commission. In March 1987, the Canadian publication Ploughshares Monitor noted that for about a decade it has been Canada's declared ambition to increase its sales of military commodities to the Third World. The problem has been that this market is highly competitive and, despite a decade of effort, Canada has made no dramatic breakthrough, although it is still trying. Given the parallels between Australia and Canada, there is an obvious lesson for Australia here but one which, so far, we have not noted. Indeed, Canada's direct sales to the Third World averaged about $Can150m during the 1980s, having slipped from the peak year of 1982 when they reached $Can250m. The figures are hard to calculate, however, because some Canadian military commodities are sold to the United States and become part of total US production. </PARA>
<PARA> European companies coming to AIDEX are better known for their involvement in corruption scandals. Ferranti is in deep water at the moment since it bought the US company, International Signal and Control, two years ago-the company that made the cluster bombs which rained down on the Lebanon during Israel's invasion of 1982. ISC is one of the Beltway Bandits which grew to enormous size and influence during the Reagan years. It was one of at least a dozen of these companies which were raided by the FBI and Justice Department last year in what was described as the largest investigation of white collar crime in the history of the United States. It has a reputation for secrecy, characteristic of many defence contractors, and Ferranti lost #215m-the equivalent of $450m-because ISC led it to believe that it had won major contracts in the developing world which simply never existed. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the Pentagon bribery trials of Operation Ill Wind are in full swing, and Ferranti's erstwhile partner, James Guerin, of ISC, is being investigated for his association with a bankrupt defence contractor whose president has been jailed for conspiracy to defraud the US Defence Department of $US12m. One of ISC's subsidiaries has been named in Italy as selling arms to Iraq, possibly against US laws, with unauthorised credits from an Italian bank, possibly against Italian laws. FFV, a Swedish company taking part in AIDEX, was named in a report in February this year as having flouted an official arms embargo for years by selling antitank guns to blacklisted states, including Australia between 1966 and 1972, the years of the Vietnam debacle. The report was commissioned by the Swedish government after media allegations in 1988 of FFV arms smuggling when the company had illegally sold anti-tank guns and ammunition, much of it via Britain, worth a total of $US65m since the mid-1960's. The commission was headed by Justice Chancellor Hans Stark, the Government's top ombudsman who scrutinises the behaviour of civil servants and officials in the public sector. It is not surprising, then, that fifteen countries will be taking part in AIDEX 89, with France having the largest display area. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting article in Time magazine on 3 July, entitled `Boom into Bust' made the comment:</PARA>
<PARA> Governments are chopping away at budget deficits; regional conflicts have been noticeably reduced, leading to reductions in export sales. East-West arms-control talks are gaining momentum. </PARA>
<PARA> A disheartened Israeli executive is quoted as saying with a sigh that, `The military market just isn't what it used to be'. Further on the article says that contractors are fighting to preserve their bottom lines in several ways. Many are hustling as much business as they can in the Third World and along the Pacific Rim. Not surprisingly, many of these companies are coming to Australia's arms bazaar to drum up business in the Third World and the Pacific Rim. We are very well placed to be that springboard. The United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in its most recent report stated that world arms international transfers had now topped $US56 billion, and that the most promising market is east and south Asia where `the size and importance of the markets are increasing'. </PARA>
<PARA> South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan, is the fastest growing region for weapons sales. In 1977, east and south Asia represented only 6 per cent of the world's weapons import market. They now represent 23 per cent of the market. India, of course, has become the latest potential threat to Australia since it acquired a nuclear submarine from the Soviet Union, and it aims to deploy three aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean. The worst case scenario warriors who have picked on India as the latest threat to Australia have been noticeably silent on an Australian company's partnership with a Dutch company to design India's latest naval base in Kerala. How hypocritical! Nor do they seem to have noticed that India this year took a decision to start exporting military equipment, doubtless for the same reason as Australia-to offset their imbalance of payments caused by buying expensive military equipment from overseas. Such are the contradictions of those who have a vested interest in maintaining the threat while trying to maximise arms sales to the region. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments also pose another problem for Australia, not only because so many other countries are moving in on the region we have targeted for military exports, but also because in September this year, the head of the World Bank, Barber B. Conable, made a statement to the Board of Governors in Washington, and Australia is on that Board. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Developing countries on one side, and their arms suppliers and creditors on the other, must adapt to a world where budgets are tight. It is important to place military spending decisions on the same footing as other fiscal decisions, to examine possible trade-offs more systematically and to explore ways to bring military spending into better balance with development priorities. In evaluating their military expenditures, Governments should be realistic, but they also should remember the human consequences of these choices. </PARA>
<PARA>When I referred this speech to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) representing the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) on 31 October in connection with a question about HMAS Tobruk being used as a floating arms bazaar for visiting south and south west Asia on its way back from Gallipoli next year, all I got was a meaningless re-statement of government policy on military exports. It was an evasive answer which totally avoided my concern about how we can reconcile this military export drive into Asia with what the head of the World Bank was telling us in September in Washington. It is not surprising, then, that companies like Rockwell International, faced with a downturn at home, are moving into this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The article in Time magazine pointed out that countries like the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom are pegging back their defence budgets, and defence manufacturers are having to lay off their workers. West German and Scandinavian firms have kept their order books filled with overseas transactions, and countries like Britain are marketing more aggressively abroad. Many of these countries and companies, like Rockwell International, are coming to AIDEX 89 precisely because they see south and east Asia as the best growth area for their products. For them, Australia is a suitable base. As another Rockwell vice-president put it:</PARA>
<PARA> We are transferring technology from the USA into Australia, bolstering its technology and capability. In turn, Rockwell is using Ship Subsystems Australia as its means of obtaining new maritime revenue for its venture into the Asia/Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophy is to establish a legal entity in Australia to execute the submarine project primarily and, secondarily, to pursue the Australian surface combatant project which has now started. The third priority is to move out from Australia to the Pacific with that capability. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he added that he expects other US defence contractors to mimic Rockwell's actions while European firms seek business in the USA. The list of companies taking part in AIDEX 89 shows that he is obviously correct, but it is not only US companies which are coming; the Europeans are as well. As an article in Le Monde put it last year, `Peace threatens sales in the arms bazaar'. </PARA>
<PARA> The winding down of the Gulf War has been quite a blow to the 60 or so countries which had been selling weapons to Iran and Iraq while more than a million people died. One of the visitors to AIDEX 89 will be Monsieur Serge Dassault, the President Director-General of Avions Marcel Dassault, who will be leading a team of fifteen of his company's top executives to Canberra. This is the company which sold arms to Iraq with between F40 billion and F60 billion during the period of the Gulf War. This is the company which sold dozens of Mirage F1 jet fighters to Iraq, some of which, according to the January 1989 edition of the Geographic Magazine, may have been used to drop the deadly poison-gas bombs on Kurdish civilians, an act which, of course, we all deplored. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest news is that, following a successful campaign initiated by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, Britain has decided not to sell aircraft to Iraq and so France through this same company, Dassault, is hoping to get the latest contract. Of course, it is not only European and American companies which will be taking part in AIDEX. Over the last few years, a number of Third World countries have entered the market for precisely the same reason as Australia, to try to offset their balance of payments problems caused by importing expensive hi-tech military equipment from Europe and North America. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the leading Third World major-weapon producing countries include Israel, India, Brazil, Taiwan, Argentina, South Africa, North and South Korea, Egypt and the ASEAN countries. At least two of the top three Third World arms producers will be taking part in AIDEX, Brazil and South Korea, while most of the others will be excluded because of their international status or their politics. AIDEX is supposed to be only for friendly nations according to the publicity brochures. In the last few years, Brazil has become a major supplier of weapons to the Middle East. Iraq and Saudi Arabia were its main customers. So was Libya with deals worth more than $US1 billion. This was made possible because the Brazilian Government views arms sales as strictly business ventures. Brazilian companies are rarely held back by political considerations. Brazil's arms exports have skyrocketed, from zero in 1974 to $US1.3 billion in 1984. It sold to both sides in the Gulf War and the state-run Brazilian War Materiel Company, IMBEL, exports over 50 types of military goods to over 70 countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> South Korea has been developing a major arms industry for over a decade, encouraged through special licensing deals to manufacture US weaponry that America offered when it withdrew some of its troops from Asia. In 1971, the United States licensed South Korea to produce M16 rifles and since then, other licenses have been issued to make ammunition for the US designed M14 rifle as well as F5 fighter jets. It did not get permission to produce F16s although it sought such a license. Today South Korea specialises in tanks, armoured personnel carriers, munitions, aircraft and patrol boats. Larger arsenals of US arms, left behind at the close of the Korean War, were fitted with indigenously produced components built especially for Third World clients. In 1986, two US analysts from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies identified South Korea as the fourth largest exporter of arms to the Third World. South Korea has sold primary rifles, pistols, grenade launchers, ammunition mortars and explosives to nations such as Guatemala, Ecuador, Malaysia, Burma, Bangladesh, South Yemen, Cameroon and Indonesia. Its ultimate goal is a $2 billion per annum arms business. In passing, it is also worth noting the comment of a public relations consultant for a British defence manufacturer which has done business with South Korea. The consultant stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It's an impossible situation for us-trying to explain to the Koreans about our share price. They are just not interested in publicising basic information about contract values and items being sold. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the secrecy that characterises the world of arms bazaars which Australia is now seeking to embrace. It is worth noting too that Australia, along with other countries, has been worried about the increasing number of countries making missiles and exporting them. So it is important to note that in 1978 South Korea tested a modified copy of the United States made Nike Hercules surface-to-air missile and has since displayed it at several international arms bazaars. On two occasions South Korea's expansion into high technology areas has run afoul of the US export administration Act, once after the export of the US licensed PSMM-5 patrol boats to Indonesia in 1979-80 and then after a request to sell howitzers, mortars and ammunition to Jordan in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The question remains as to how long the United States can prevent countries like South Korea from selling weapons to unstable Third World countries. The answer may depend on the future proliferation of defence technology throughout the world. This will make it harder for the United States to identify its own components in foreign military equipment. A number of the ASEAN countries will be represented as well, though not necessarily as displayers. After all, they are the principal market for the wares available. Singapore and Indonesia are the only members of ASEAN which have promoted a military export industry and Singapore has also been responsible for channelling military hardware from countries like Israel through to a third party like Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> Singapore and Thailand have also hosted highly sophisticated regional arms bazaars over the past few years. Since 1985 Indonesia has been boosting its weapons industry and streamlining defence production to lessen dependence on foreign arms and spare parts. Indonesia already produces or assembles, mostly under licence, fighter and trainer aircraft, missiles, torpedoes, helicopters, naval equipment and a range of spare parts. They come mostly from the State-owned Nurtanio aircraft plant at Bandung, the naval shipyard at Surabaya and the army industrial plant-all state corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, Indonesia has imported submarines from West Germany, patrol boats from Australia and South Korea, Exocet missiles from France, corvettes from the Netherlands, refitted frigates from Britain; more recently Sweden has decided that it can sell military equipment to Indonesia despite the ongoing war in East Timor and West Papua. I have argued principally against Australia's promotion of military exports on moral grounds but there are economic grounds for opposing Australia's moves in this direction. The market is shrinking but as I have indicated the competition is increasing. Australia cannot compete in areas of highly sophisticated equipment like aircraft nor can it compete with the cheaper labour markets in Asia-countries like India, Pakistan, South and North Korea and China. </PARA>
<PARA> One argument has been that this country should find openings where we can compete, areas such as the export of minesweepers to countries in the Persian Gulf. Fortunately, of course, the war ceased last year so, unfortunately for the marketeers, that market disappeared. One problem is that there are no prospects for long-term major conflict in this part of the world-again from the point of view of the arms sales merchants. Apart from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia virtually all countries in the region are loosely or closely aligned with the West or are trying to be non-aligned and self-sufficient like China. There are longstanding counter-insurgency wars like those in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Burma, however. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are military forces whose main role is for internal repression, from Pakistan and Burma-or Myanmar as it is now called-to China and South Korea, as well as the national security states in between. It is my chief fear that the military hardware being promoted at AIDEX is either to keep the military happy in national security states like Malaysia and Thailand or for internal repression in other countries which proclaim to be democracies like the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have seen in the last few years, countries such as Sweden and West Germany have been involved in arms deals reeking of corruption. As the competition increases, short cuts are taken. Add to this the transfer of arms through dummy companies, third and fourth country middlemen, the use of faked end-user certificates, ships which disappear from the seas only to reappear halfway around the world with new names painted on their bows and new flags flying from their masts, and weapons flood into tragic countries like the Lebanon, the Gulf states, Myanmar, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, though everyone publicly deplores the bloodshed. Only this year, we learned that South Africa is exporting to 32 countries despite the United Nations arms embargo. Everyone sold to friend and foe during the Gulf War, and dozens of countries to both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> Far larger than this blatantly illegal black market for weapons is the grey trade of selling through respectable and democratic countries to questionable regimes and terrorist movements around the globe. For example, Britain, which will be taking part in AIDEX, frowns on arms sales to Libya. However, it will readily issue one of its own companies an export licence to sell to, say, Greece which is a friendly country, a fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ally. A company in Athens would then have little trouble persuading the Greek government to issue a licence to export to Syria. From Syria the weapons could be dispatched to Libya, the Palestine Liberation Organisation or almost anyone in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the military export companies now established in Canberra is Plessey Australia Pty Ltd which sold radar equipment to Iran in 1987 on the basis that it was a defensive system intended for use along the Soviet-Iranian border. One Ministry of Defence official commented that he knew the radar systems would not be used in the Gulf War because, `We have diplomats who can go and check these things out'. In reality, Britain's diplomatic presence in Tehran was limited to a section of the Swedish Embassy. The Iranian Government has often refused foreign diplomats permission to travel in sensitive areas of the country, especially along the Soviet and Iraqi frontiers. Needless to say, Britain will be well represented at AIDEX, and so will Plessey. </PARA>
<PARA> France has often been criticised for allowing French companies to sell arms to warring Iraq, Argentina and Chile, under military rule, and a whole range of despotic Third World regimes such as the Central African Republic under the Emperor Jean Bokassa and Papa Doc's Haiti. France, as I have already noted, will have the largest display area at AIDEX. This is the world that we are walking into. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also where HMAS Tobruk proposes to go next year in its capacity as a floating arms bazaar after delivering the old Diggers to Gallipoli. Yet when I asked a question about where it was going, all I received was a non-answer worthy of the ex-National Party Premier of Queensland in his heyday. I would suggest that the main reason we are doing this is to offset our own imbalance of payments, which at the military level is caused by the import of capital equipment costing well over $1 billion a year through the mid-1980s. I would therefore suggest that at the practical level Australia start by reducing its own military expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> On Monday we read that the United States is reducing its defence expenditure by $10 billion. The Soviet Union has drastically reduced its inflated military budget by 14.2 per cent and factories that produced tanks are now producing many other socially useful products. Other countries have reduced or held back on the expansion of their military expenditure with a few tragic exceptions. The 1980s has been one of the bloodiest decades of history but as it draws to a close many of the longstanding conflicts seem also to be drawing to a close which is a very hopeful sign. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding question remains: Why is Australia increasing its defence expenditure as a proportion of the overall budget from 8.8 per cent in 1979 to 9.6 per cent this year? We have no perceived enemies. As the 1981 Katter report, Threats to Australia's Security; Their Nature and Probability observed, only one country has the ability to mount a successful invasion of Australia, and that is the United States which has no motive to do so. Some of us might cynically observe that it has no need to anyway as the cultural invasion took place long ago. Any other country would take five to ten years to develop that capability. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to envisage why any country should invade or harass Australia. It is much cheaper to trade with than to invade Australia. The savage irony is that Australia could well become a base for arming the region-a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are no submarines to threaten Australian shipping in this part of the world, apart from those in Japan, China, Indonesia and India, yet we are contemplating the sale of submarines to Thailand, India and Canada and possibly other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of resolving potential regional conflicts, non-military solutions represent the best way forward. Working to promote common security, encouraging the creation of regional forums to promote cooperation and understanding, and developing mechanisms for negotiations, arbitration and non-violent conflict resolution would be more profitable than arming Australia and the region. That is the direction that Australia should take. By putting the emphasis on non-offensive defence for Australia and common security for the region, Australia need not import expensive military equipment from abroad. In turn, we do not need to seek a doubling of our military exports to offset these costs, nor the holding of exhibitions like AIDEX '89 to bring together the merchants of death from around the world. Our research can be directed into socially useful forms of production along with our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I was cheered to read recently in Time magazine that Soviet defence plants are now cranking up their output of television sets, refrigerators, sausage machines, vacuum cleaners, pasta equipment and washing machines. This is a real peace conversion, but I would rather that Australian research and Australian industry never had to get into developing military hardware in the first place, apart from a modest production of items for our own coastal defence, and not for export. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area concerns me and that is the creation of a lobby group in Australia who have a vested interest in maintaining a strong military force in Australia. We have read recently of the problems that the United States and the Soviet Union are facing in beginning to run down rather than expand their military programs. There are people in the military, in intelligence and in industry who do not welcome the end of the Cold War. They thrive on secrecy and paranoia and threats. As an article in the Canberra Times observed on 2 October this year:</PARA>
<PARA>The arms world is a dirty business although run, on the face of it, by gentlemen and retired officers. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to see the creation of such a lobby in Australia. In the last decade, arms bazaars have been cancelled in Anaheim and San Mateo in the United States, and in Rotterdam and Wiesbaden in West Europe, as a result of the protests from churches and peace groups. After two years of growing protests, the organisers of the annual Military Electronics Expo announced in 1980 that they would hold no further arms fairs anywhere in the USA. It seems that the tendency is now to hold such events in Asia and Australia, and it is sad that having cancelled PADEX in 1986, the Government has taken a step backwards by allowing and encouraging AIDEX 89. I sincerely hope that this will be the last such arms bazaar ever held in this country. </PARA>

Senator Schacht started the debate by saying that he was going to pay tribute to a major statesperson who had died.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fiji. Senator Parer, the second speaker in the debate, took the occasion to make an attack upon what he called the integrity of the Goss led Labor Party in Queensland. It is Senator Parer's right and privilege in the adjournment debate to do this, but it raises a number of questions. The first question it raises is a question of credibility. In the context of post-Fitzgerald-report-modern Queensland, is an attack upon the alleged lack of integrity of a Labor opposition credible from a Liberal senator when he has not one single word to say about the proven level of corruption in Queensland under the existing National Party Administration? Of course, there is no credibility in that. Senator Parer's lack of objectivity and of even-handedness paints him as someone who is defending the status quo and, by extension it could be argued, the corruption that he never referred to within Queensland. I reject all his remarks about a lack of integrity on the part of the Goss led Labor Party. To allege that problems in Queensland are associated with a leader of a party who is recognised universally for his integrity is a major act by Senator Parer that stretches credibility beyond measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question it raises is the question of ethics. Parliament has the right of privilege for the purpose that it should be free to discuss any matter. That is a prerequisite for open democracy. But there are times in which the limits of that privilege are extended. Senator Parer said today that the law had been broken in Queensland. True, he amended that by adding `in my opinion'. He also said that constituents alleged that Mr Hollis's campaign is being run out of Garry Johns's office. Then he asserted that taxpayers' money is being spent on trying to elect the Labor Party in Queensland. Those are allegations, it is true. The fact that not one shred of evidence was ever presented suggests that those allegations do not have too much to back them. To simply make an allegation and let it hang in a pre-election context is a reflection of bad faith on Senator Parer's part. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question it raises is the question of Senator Parer's judgment. He has had incorporated in Hansard a letter in order that he might make an attack upon Mr Frank Bradley, who it appears is a member of the Labor Party. It is interesting to read the letter that is exhibit A in Senator Parer's attack upon the integrity of the Labor Party. The letter is headed, `A Call To Restore Honour And Dignity To Queensland And Our Parliament'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> May I please raise the issue of the Queensland elections and the urgent need to restore the honour and dignity of our Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Our traditional institutions are in jeopardy. Public morale is at a low ebb. Corruption stalks the land. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party is at fault through its contempt for the Parliamentary process and our long established Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA> The power of Parliament as the people's house is in danger of disappearing altogether unless principled and farsighted folk take a strong stand at the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA> It is plain that the Liberal Party cannot win enough seats to lead the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what they say now, the Liberals will do a deal with the Nationals after the election. That's their usual politics. All they can promise is more of the same. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in such a mess! Only you, the electors, can save our State. </PARA>
<PARA> Wayne Goss and Labor are the only team who can be completely committed to a strong Parliament through Mr Fitzgerald's reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time for those of us who usually vote Liberal to use Labor to stop the rot and restore the dignity of Parliament and the honour of our State. </PARA>
<PARA> We are fortunate that Wayne Goss, a sensible and sincere lawyer, is on hand to lead the Labor team and do the job for us. </PARA>

Exhibit A from Senator Parer is nothing less than a letter from a confirmed Liberal and a past serving parliamentarian who rose to the distinction of being the Speaker of the Parliament in Victoria asking electors in Queensland to vote for the Labor Party. This is Senator Parer's weapon to allege corruption against the Goss Labor team. Thank you, Senator Parer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 28 September 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In proposing a training levy or tax for all companies with a payroll exceeding $200,000, does the Minister also intend to provide a tax incentive to those companies which spend in excess of the required percentage of payroll on approved training schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Can the Minister also confirm that 40 per cent of submissions regarding industry training in Australia were opposed to government-initiated funding of industry training and that only 25 per cent supported the proposed training levy.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Can the Minister also confirm that it is the Government's intention to collect a training levy or tax of 1 per cent of companies' payroll from 1 July 1990 and that the levy will rise to 1.5 per cent in 1991-92 and that at this stage no method of collection of the levy nor its distribution amongst training bodies has been verified.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Training Guarantee is intended to provide a spur to those enterprises where training performance is inadequate. It is a minimum requirement and well below what best practice firms are already doing. Enterprises which have a strong commitment to training will not be penalised. However, the Government does not intend to provide incentives for training through the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 40 per cent of submissions were opposed to Government-initiated funding, while 35 per cent of submissions supported a Training Guarantee to some extent. More importantly, however, about 60 per cent of submissions supported some form of collective action to improve the training effort. While peak employer bodies and individual employers were opposed to any form of government imposed levy no one has convincingly demonstrated how to maintain the momentum of training reform without some form of compulsory funding arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention is to introduce a Training Guarantee set at 1 per cent of payroll with effect from 1990-91 rising to 1.5 per cent after two years. The emphasis is on requiring all enterprises with an annual payroll above a certain threshold, likely to be $200 000, to spend a minimum amount on approved training activities, with any shortfall between required and actual expenditures being collected as Government revenue to fund additional training activities. The Government has not taken a decision on collection or disbursement mechanisms for the Training Guarantee because it is seeking a co-operative implementation approach with the States. The Commonwealth will also be holding discussions with peak employer groups and the ACTU on implementation issues.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3099" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Many countries provide social security benefits to residents (including Australian citizens) on the basis of their affiliation with the particular country's social security scheme. Entitlement in most cases, particularly in Europe and the Americas, would depend on contributions made to the national social security scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Contribution-based social security schemes which provide benefits on the basis of contributions made during periods of employment usually also credit contributions for deemed periods (such as army service, child raising etc). Deemed periods may not be available to non-citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> On available information, the only country which denies entitlement on the basis of citizenship is Lebanon which will not provide social security coverage to non-Lebanese citizens unless the non-citizen's country provides reciprocity. South Africa has restrictions on payment of age pension-only available to non-citizens after 5 years residence.</PARA>
<PARA> Many contribution-based schemes have underlying ``safety-net'' welfare schemes. These schemes provide income-tested benefits to residents, regardless of citizenship. Spain, Malta, Canada and Italy are some examples.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Most social security schemes provide coverage for the main contingencies of old age, invalidity and death. Many have cash benefits or payments in kind for family allowance, unemployment and temporary incapacity for work while others also provide coverage for work-related accident or illness through national social security schemes or private insurance; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Contribution-based schemes require minimum periods of contributions from earnings for benefit eligibility. Specified contributions during nominated periods immediately before the contingency are usually also necessary-particularly for the short-term benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Welfare schemes normally award income-tested benefits to legal residents without prior periods of residence.</PARA>
