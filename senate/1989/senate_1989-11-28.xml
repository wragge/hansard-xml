<PARA> (1) are opposed to the holding of an Arms Bazaar, AIDEX '89, at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra on 28-30 November 1989</PARA>
<PARA> (2) believe that it is inappropriate for Australia to seek to offset its balance of payments deficit incurred through the import of expensive and unnecessary military equipment by seeking to double military exports over the next three to five years</PARA>
<PARA> (3) regard it as offensive that on one hand we offer foreign aid to neighbouring countries to improve their material standard of being, while on the other hand the merchants of death seek to persuade their rulers to buy military equipment which is entirely inappropriate to the needs of the people</PARA>

<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collection system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister representing the Prime Minister and Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the continuing campaign of industrial action by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in Victorian meatworks, which is estimated to have cost the beef industry in that State close to $50m since the end of May? Is he further aware that Deputy President Riordan, in a judgment on 13 November, described as `reprehensible' the stoppages which have continued after the insertion of a bans clause?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the same Riordan who I think would not have any reputation as being hard on the trade unions. Given that the Government, through former Minister Willis, has said that the bans clause procedures are moribund, and given the strong backing of the Government for the common law actions against the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, would the Government similarly strongly support the use of common law against this union which continues to defy the decisions and directions of the Industrial Relations Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would make no prior judgment about it. I would wait and see what circumstances emerged. Having said that, I do have a passing knowledge of the dispute to which Senator Chaney refers. No doubt, it is extraordinarily damaging to the meat industry in Victoria. Not only did Deputy President Riordan have something to say about this, but a Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission handed down a decision which apparently has not been accepted by the parties, and by the union in particular. I apologise. I think that relates partly to Queensland and partly to Victoria. The industrial action in Victoria has been going on for some time. Riordan inserted a bans clause on 1 November. I accept Senator Chaney's suggestion that no action has been taken in respect of that at this stage. I will try to obtain further information from the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the Minister to examine the history of these rolling strikes; to examine the defiance of the Industrial Relations Commission, which is part of the pattern of behaviour; to examine the destruction not merely of private business but of Australia's export trade; and to advise the Senate whether in those circumstances, where there is clear defiance of the Commission, the Government would support the use of common law actions by employers who have received absolutely no satisfaction from the other processes which are available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to press reports of the comments of the Western Australian Minister of Police, Mr Ian Taylor, regarding a bikie gang war in Western Australia. What action does the Minister intend to take in regard to this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3429" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. This is `Bikie Wars II'. I did notice the comments of Mr Taylor from Western Australia. It is a typical case of a provincial Minister dumping all responsibility where it does not belong, that is, back to the Federal Government. If Mr Taylor had the slightest knowledge at all of our deportation laws, he would know that I am hardly likely to start deporting victims of crime. What I have consistently said is that if a criminal act has occurred and a conviction occurs, and the criminal act involves violence, I will have no hesitation at all in deporting those particular individuals. But I cannot just willy nilly pull out of the hospital some bloke who has been shot and say to him, `You are a victim of a bikie war. I am sending you home'. I would have thought that the major job in Western Australia was for the police to catch the perpetrators and prosecute them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The secondary issue, however, is serious, in as much as it is rumoured that a thousand of the victims' friends from New Zealand are going to arrive over here in some way and start a major brawl. We have contacted the New Zealand police and obtained the names of at least 1,000 of the New Zealand bikie gang, and we will use that list to make sure when people arrive in this country that they are not coming here for the wrong purpose. There is a section under the Act which allows us to return them to New Zealand straightaway. But I am not about to stop everyone who has a tattoo or a leather jacket getting off QF1 and say, `You can't arrive here'. The trans-Tasman agreement is a little more serious than that, I would believe.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a little unfortunate in that I thought we had finally started to bury some of the myths surrounding New Zealand immigrants to this country. This year 27,000 New Zealanders will permanently settle in Australia. All our surveys show that they are younger, more skilled and less prone to criminal activity for the age group than the Australian average, and the old image of the Bondi New Zealand dole bludger has well and truly been put to rest. The unemployment rate of New Zealand born citizens in this country is below the Australian average and, especially considering their age range, that is even more surprising, and the same with criminal activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney should not distract me; I was just about to wind up. The honourable senator wants a short answer and I was just about to wind up. Criminality for that age group is again well below the Australian average. I hope that intemperate remarks made by someone looking to blame someone else in Western Australia do not again spark an anti-New Zealand feeling in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. Is the Minister, by giving a very brief answer-in fact, a non-answer-to the question, relating to a serious matter before the people of South Australia at the moment, saying that he is satisfied with interest rates which are double those of many comparable countries, inflation which is double that of the average of the seven major industrial countries, the highest current account deficit relative to gross domestic product (GDP) of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country and declining real wages in five out of the seven years of Labor's term in office?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that. It was a very deft supplementary question that the honourable senator cobbled together, and I shall comment on various parts of it. Certainly, I am not happy with the high interest rates which currently prevail in Australia. As the honourable senator knows, I have answered questions about that matter almost every day in the Senate for some weeks now, and I do not propose to repeat the answer. As to the comment that the inflation rate is double that of our trading partners, that is partly true in respect of some of our trading partners but it is not true in respect of others. But the rate of inflation in Australia is too high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product is concerned, I am not satisfied with that, but I think the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP is exactly the same as when the Liberal-National Government went out of office in 1982. As for wages, yes, it is true that there has been a lowering of real wages for adult males in Australia during the period of this Government. On the other hand, household disposable income has increased. The only year in which household disposable income declined by more than a very modest sum was in 1982, the last year of the coalition Government. I do not think the honourable senator mentioned the question of employment, but the Government is very satisfied with the employment growth which has taken place in this country and which has contributed to rising per capita household incomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade relates to two rather contradictory public statements issued by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock. Is the Government guilty of `timidity and equivocation', as Mr Peacock claims, in not to date taking legal action against Pol Pot in the International Court of Justice? Is Mr Peacock's recent conversion to this litigation proposal a rather desperate attempt by him to gain the high moral ground he had apparently abandoned, at least to my confusion, as recently as 15 November when he issued a press release proposing that the Khmer Rouge be part of an interim Cambodian Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3430" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Peacock, in a rather long and fierce press release which he issued yesterday, criticised the Government for `timidity', `passivity', and `equivocating and refusing to take a lead' in initiating action against Pol Pot, and those who were his deputies in the 1975-79 period, in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) under the Genocide Convention. It was, of course, the Labor Government, through Mr Hayden, that first internationally raised the possibility, in 1986, of establishing an appropriate international tribunal to determine the culpability of the Pol Pot leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We continue to regard this proposal as an attractive one and are continuing to explore ways of implementing it. We do so not only because properly documented findings of guilt by a credible international tribunal would no doubt have a major impact on international public opinion, but also because it might help to define with more precision the identities of those who should under no circumstances be allowed to play a role in the future of any Cambodian administration -and, as such, would address one of the numerous practical problems that need to be addressed before free elections can be held.</PARA>
<PARA> However, if the proposal is to be implemented, a practical way of doing so must be found. It is the present judgment of the Government, based on detailed consideration in 1986 and subsequently by our own international lawyers, that, contrary to Mr Peacock's assertion, there are formidable procedural and jurisdictional obstacles standing in the way of the initiation of an action by Australia against Pol Pot and his deputies in the International Court of Justice. That is why Mr Hayden did not put the proposal forward in those terms and why it has not been pursued in the International Court since then.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me spell out the position a little further, Mr President. While it is true that cases heard by the ICJ involve states, rather than governments, bringing actions against each other, and while both Australia and Cambodia are states-parties to the Genocide Convention, for all practical purposes litigation has to take place between governments which are in effective control of the states in question. Even if the court were prepared to regard an action in the present matter as properly initiated against the Coalition Government of Democratic Cambodia (CGDK), which is only in effective control of the seat in the United Nations and not anything else in Cambodia, rather than the current Hun Sen administration on the ground in Phnom Penh, the Court, nonetheless, has made clear that it will pronounce judgment-and I quote from a 1960s case which is still, I believe, good law-`only in connection with concrete cases where there exists at the time of the adjudication an actual controversy involving a conflict of legal interests between the parties'. It will be remembered, for example, that in the French nuclear test case the court held that it would not consider Australia's claim for a declaration, given that France had undertaken not to conduct any more atmospheric tests.</PARA>
<PARA> So there is a very real question, accordingly, as to whether the court would accept jurisdiction where what would be involved, on Mr Peacock's idea, is Australia seeking to initiate an action against a regime which is no longer in effective control of the state of Cambodia, in relation to events more than 10 years old. There is, moreover, a very real political, or perhaps I should preferably say `diplomatic', problem in the present environment for Australia, which has refused to give any formal recognition to the Pol Pot regime as the legitimate government of the state of Cambodia, in effect doing so-if only for the formal purposes of this litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, having said that, if Mr Peacock does have access to what he describes as `extensive international legal analysis' by reputable international lawyers credibly establishing that the various legal concerns I have expressed are ill-founded, and credibly establishing that there are no serious practical obstacles standing in the way of initiation of proceedings, I would be very glad if he would make that material available. Certainly, the Government would give very serious consideration to pursuing such a case if we genuinely thought it would not be rejected by the Court, just as we would, of course, be prepared to support any other government which was willing and proved able to initiate such proceedings itself. Until such a case is established and not just asserted, it is proper to regard Mr Peacock's contribution to this debate-whether or not it was an attempt, as Senator Collins says, to recapture the high moral ground-as just another example of the politics of the grand empty gesture which he has made peculiarly his own.</PARA>
<PARA> I finish by saying that in the absence of the availability of the ICJ there are simply no other international courts or tribunals which could possibly play a relevant role. A more realistic approach to the question of determining Pol Pot's guilt has always seemed to the Government to be the establishment-preferably by multilateral international agreement but, failing that, on some ad hoc basis-of an essentially informal tribunal of senior, respected, international legal figures. There would be no authority in this context to compel anyone's presence or to apply sanctions of any kind, or even make a declaratory judgment of the weight that a judgment of that kind would have in the International Court. Nonetheless, presumably, some effective exercise in weighting and balancing the available evidence would possibly be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden raised this possibility when discussing the issue internationally, as he did quite extensively after he first raised it at the Association of South East Asian Nations post-ministerial conference in 1986. At the time he was forced to conclude that there was not sufficient international support in practice to proceed with that proposal. It may be that in the present environment there would be more such support, and I will certainly take the opportunity to discuss the question in the course of my contacts with foreign ministerial and other relevant figures over the next few months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second question on this matter from Senator McLean, who is obviously showing quite an interest in it. I mentioned, when I was asked the first time, that I had written to the New South Wales Government and I have now received a response from Mr Hay, the Minister for Local Government and Planning in that Government. In his response, Mr Hay stated that the Wyong Shire Council referred a draft local environment plan to his Department so that a report could be prepared and, based on that report, the Minister would decide whether to approve the proposed rezoning of part of the North Entrance Peninsula to permit a tourist facility and golf course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hay tells me that a revised plan has been submitted in which this proposed tourist facility does not involve lake foreshore areas or the dredging or destruction of estuarine and wetland areas. Wyong Council has deferred its consideration of plans which could affect the lake foreshore and the beach frontage. I have received Mr Hay's assurance that he will have regard to the issues I have raised, in particular the migratory birds agreement, when he looks at zoning and future development of the peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second part of the question, the overall responsibility for the coordination role for the operation of that migratory birds agreement is via a working group of the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM). However, the responsibility for any specific site remains the responsibility of State legislation and that is a matter for State consideration. Mr Hay has indicated that he accepts the responsibility of the New South Wales Government to adhere to the principles of the migratory birds agreement. I only hope that his Government lives up to that responsibility, but I must say that I am encouraged by his response and at this stage I see no need to raise the matter with CONCOM.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jones for his question. I am sure that all honourable senators will be horrified at the apparently very violent and savage act of the drug barons of Colombia in, as they have claimed, bringing about the explosion of an aircraft with the loss of 107 innocent lives. I have mentioned in this chamber before some terrible statistics, taken from Time magazine, of drug related murders in Colombia over the past seven years-108 politicians, 157 judges, 17 journalists, 1,536 policemen, 3,491 narcotics officers, 408 soldiers, 118 guerrillas, 3,100 civilians-a total of 8,935 persons. What is clear is that the drug barons have declared war on their people and, as we know, they have also targeted Australia, or Australians, as a marketplace where they can generate cash flow to fund these nefarious murders and terrorist activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of that, I am pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I have been able to announce today that we will be helping to fund a sophisticated computer project in Colombia as a practical means of helping to fight the South American drug scourge. Indeed, this aid project will be co-funded by Australia and the Netherlands, with an Australian contribution of $150,000, operated under the banner of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. This special aid project will allow the operation of a computer databank project with combined law enforcement and preventative education objectives and will be implemented by the Colombian national council on narcotics drugs.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the years the Australian Government has had some experience in the provision to overseas countries of computer assisted methods of combating drug trafficking. In Thailand, under the auspices of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Australia has for some years been providing assistance to that agency, particularly in relation to its computer projects. That assistance has been very well received. Of course, such assistance not only is of benefit to the country concerned but, in the case of Thailand, it helps Australia as the war lords of the Golden Triangle traffic heroin into Australia. One hopes that what we do in Colombia will also help to stem the tide of cocaine which is very clearly being targeted on Australia. The Government and the peoples of Colombia have obviously been resisting this murderous activity of the drug barons in a way which is full of courage. But they need every assistance possible. I believe the international community is standing in solidarity with the Colombian people and their elected government and I believe that this enterprise, this project being undertaken by Australia with the very ready and willing cooperation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will stand as a very real symbol of the way in which the Australian people are standing with those in Colombia who are obviously the target of these terrible terrorist activities.</PARA>

The Department has decided to grant visas for the tour and I see no reason to interfere with that decision.

People in country areas will be thrilled to hear that they will see these internationally-renowned performers. The capital cities' loss, in fact, will be the country cities' gain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department's decision to grant entry to the Moscow Circus followed extensive consultations with the Director of Michael Edgley International, Mr Michael Edgley, the Australian circus owners, the Showman's Guild of Australasia and Actors Equity of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And they have not been given very much thought. The honourable senator began with the false assumption that I quoted with approval what Mr Justice Brooking said on a particular point. He began with that assumption and he went on to make a number of others. For example, he made the assumption that the Commonwealth Government could have intervened in a civil action in the Victorian Supreme Court between the airlines and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. I doubt that very much and I doubt whether the Commonwealth Government, or any other government, would be given the right to intervene in any appeal against that decision. So there are a number of assumptions which are not quite correct. Further, in relation to whether this Government would take legislative action to protect what the honourable senator terms the right to strike, I answered that question yesterday and I do not need to repeat that answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The right to strike has always been inherent in the common law. However, the right to strike is limited from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from circumstance to circumstance by the legislative action of various parliaments or various types of industrial relations systems which exist in various common law countries and States of the Commonwealth here. This case involving the air pilots, which Mr Justice Brooking decided last week, is not new in the Australian context. The honourable senator has been sitting in this Senate when other judgments of a similar kind have been made about which he or anybody else has said nothing in particular at that time. So I think the right to strike is there. I do not think it can be a totally unqualified right.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday in answer to a question from Senator Chaney, there are circumstances in which the common law courts will be reluctant to entertain jurisdiction because there is an industrial code of some kind or another covering the field of industrial relations issues. I think that has been so in a number of cases here in Australia. In the air pilots case there was no such industrial code; there was no employment relationship. At the time the proceedings were brought employment had been terminated. So the fact of the matter is that the legislative prescriptions in this country in various State jurisdictions and, to some extent, in the Federal jurisdiction have limited the right of action by employers against employees exercising the right to strike. Undoubtedly, the right to strike exists and has for a long time.</PARA>

First, has the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs ascertained how and when former Victorian National Safety Council of Australia Chief, John Friedrich-alias Johann Hohenberger-entered Australia? Secondly, is Friedrich registered as an Australian citizen? If so, on what date was he granted citizenship and how was he able to conceal the fact that he was an illegal entrant? Thirdly, can the Minister explain how an illegal entrant came to be appointed to head the Victorian branch of the National Safety Council of Australia and thereby develop privileged access to possibly sensitive information from a number of Commonwealth government departments and statutory bodies? Fourthly, does the Minister intend to grant Friedrich an entry permit to enable him to remain in Australia after 19 December, at which date he will presumably be subject to mandatory deportation under section 17a of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me put it in this way, Mr President: nothing in my answer would go in any way against anything that is held against Mr Friedrich in court, I believe. From my point of view, we have no record of entry to Australia or grant of Australian citizenship to Mr John Friedrich. Mr Friedrich's marriage certificate shows his place of birth as Munich, Germany. Mr Johann Friedrich Hohenberger arrived in Melbourne on 20 January 1975 and was issued with a temporary entry permit until 22 January 1975, when he evidently departed. We have no records of any subsequent re-entry by Mr Hohenberger. The Department believes that Mr John Friedrich and Johann Friedrich Hohenberger are the same person. This view is also supported by the Australian Federal Police. The Department has written to Mr Friedrich's solicitor to establish Mr Friedrich's immigration status. In fact, we have written on two occasions and no reply has been received to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the third part of the question, it does not fall within my ministerial responsibility if an organisation outside the Federal Government's jurisdiction appoints someone to a particular position or not. As to the last question, any action by my Department to detain or deport Mr Friedrich at this stage would be inappropriate in view of the potential Victorian Supreme Court proceedings. Any future action on this matter will depend on his immigration status at the outcome of the court proceedings and consideration of other relevant factors.</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that after 19 December mandatory deportation will exist and it will be one of the factors, I hope, that will discourage illegal immigrants from staying in Australia. I know that all sections of the Act were not given full support in this chamber. However, they will become law and it will be much more difficult for illegal entrants to remain in Australia and, once discovered, it will be much easier to return them to where they came from.</PARA>

I also draw Senator Jenkins's attention to, I think it was, a New South Wales Supreme Court ruling of two months ago. If the legal authorities in this country seek to have Mr Friedrich stay here, they may seek an injunction to do so.

<PARA>I understand that Senator Watson said that because some concern has been expressed in Tasmania about this aspect of the coalition's Economic Action Plan. If I might say so, with a classic piece of Opposition newspeak, Senator Watson has attempted to allay this concern by talking about the integration of Skillshare and Jobtrain with only the name changing, but he has neglected to advise readers of the Mercury of the savings which are inherent in the Opposition's plan. In the attachments to the coalition's Economic Action Plan, the relevant shadow Minister, Mr Beale, says this:</PARA>
<PARA>Skillshare, a scheme built on the ruins of the discredited community youth support scheme, will be phased out as soon as possible. Emphasis on finding employment for the long term unemployed and disadvantaged will be concentrated through the Jobtrain program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports in several newspapers today which in similar terms quote Senator Chris Puplick, the shadow Minister for the environment, in criticising the Prime Minister's announcement of the terms of reference of the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry into the forestry industry. The first thing I say about this is that the Government's legislation on the Resource Assessment Commission was supported in the end by the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Australian Petroleum Explorers Association, the National Farmers Federation, the National Association of Forest Industries and by conservation groups. It appears that, notwithstanding that support, Senator Puplick has another view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second point, I might say that the Resource Assessment Commission is headed by a distinguished judge in Australia, Justice Stewart. For this reference he is joined by a former Associate Professor of Economics at Macquarie University, David James, and the Chief Research Scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Wildlife and Ecology Division, Graham Caughley, to constitute a bench to inquire into forestry in Australia, in all of its dimensions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A bench for the Commission. Commissions in this country have benches if there is more than one person sitting on them. I could go on and enlighten the honourable senator but to do that would take all of Question Time. I do not have the time. The honourable senator's enlightenment will have to wait for a more appropriate opportunity. The information that is currently available for a consideration of a reference of this nature is held by forestry commissions in the various States of Australia but is also held, for example, in the Australian Conservation Foundation's Wood and the Trees document, a study into plantation forestry by that body, and in the Forest and Forest Products Industry Advisory Council (FAFPIC) plan for the future of the industry. Both of those organisations would say, if one were to ask them, that that information is now old and a little out of date and needs updating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any case, this Government has currently on foot with the States a survey to constitute a national forest inventory for Australia and, as we speak, is fashioning a national plantation strategy for Australia, not to mention the fact that forestry information coming out of Tasmania since the historic Labor-Green accord-which has led to the Salamanca agreement between the industry, the Government, the Commission and environmentalists on management of forests in that State-has also produced quite startlingly new evidence and is set to produce further evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, our agreement with the State of New South Wales for a south-east forest agreement covering studies on flora and fauna, flitch mills, small and round wood, value added and saw milling will produce new and better evidence. Therefore, given that this format-the Resource Assessment Commission-is to invite the public and/or community organisations and industry groups to make submissions to it so that there can be a sense of public inquiry, it is proper that it should take the time span allocated to it. The criticisms of it by the Opposition are nothing short of carping, narrow and insensitive, and we expect to come out of this process a sustainable development recommendation. This is the very sort of process recommended in the Brundtland report-the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development-and is the sort of route that this Government announced in its environment program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service underwent a full review, resulting in the Lindsay report. An interim copy of that report was delivered early in 1988 and a full copy later that year. As a consequence, the Government reviewed the operations of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. In doing so, it consulted widely with industry groups, including the National Farmers Federation. The result of that review was a big tick by all the organisations concerned that we had a lean and efficient organisation which would guarantee the very high standard of quality and protection that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service delivers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I am aware that the Opposition spokesman for primary industries, Mr Bruce Lloyd, has just issued a media release in which he says a number of things that I had previously cautioned the Opposition not to say. He makes aspersions about the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in relation to fire blight when he knows full well that a discussion paper is circulating on that subject and that no decision has been taken. He makes aspersions about transmittable gastroenteritis when he knows that nothing has happened yet and that we are in fact in consultation with pig producers around Australia and reviewing their concerns about that issue. He makes aspersions about black spot, when that was an example of successful detection by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and about nashi fruit when he knows that no protocol is yet signed.</PARA>
<PARA> We have here a group of misrepresentations about the effectiveness of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I now again and for the final time caution Mr Lloyd and ask him to stop trying to undermine the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service because, if he were to continue this process, I believe it would do serious damage to Australia's export effort.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Opposition is proposing direct cuts of $10m in funding under its Economic Action Plan. As a consequence of other changes, the total reduction in funding to the Quarantine and Inspection Service would be something of the order of $26m. Therefore, the Opposition would be gelding the Service quite considerably of the essential funds it needs to deliver the protection to the rural community. If this continual criticism of the Inspection Service continues, the Government will have no option but to raise again the sorry dilemma that arose for rural producers in this country when Australia's reputation as a fair and successful trader was besmirched by the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, the meat substitution racket and a number of other events that affected our trading position in the world as a producer of good traded goods on the world market. I conclude by saying that there is something passing odd about Mr Bruce Lloyd's press release of last week relating to meat inspectors, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA>This measure alone would remove 350 or about 2000 meat inspectors, the major employment category and cost to AQIS.</PARA>
<PARA>If it removed 350 or about 2,000-there are only about 2,000 meat inspectors employed-according to Mr Bruce Lloyd's own words there would be no meat inspectors to carry out the essential work that is being done in Australia in protecting the public of Australia and ensuring a high standard of quarantine and health protection for overseas clients of our meat output.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 August the Government tabled in the Senate Health Insurance (Vocational Registration of GP's) Regulation, Statutory Rules No. 270 of 1989. This was done as part of the Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance which reported on the vocational register of general practitioners. Today is, I think, the last day on which any honourable senator could give notice for disallowance of this regulation. I simply wish to indicate that, after considering this matter, the Opposition has decided not to give such notice. As will be known, we opposed the passage of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1989. We have now had a look at the regulation which has been promulgated as a result of the passage of that Act and under section 10 of the Act. Concerns which we raised were in relation to the question of control of certain activities by way of regulation. In terms of the practical operation of the register, however, the crucial issue is not what is now contained in the regulations but rather what is contained in the guidelines published by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), which are used to assess the eligibility for admission to the register. The regulations state that the document containing these guidelines is publicly available in the Sydney office of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, they are not a Government document; they are a College document. But the Government is working from them for the purpose of this legislation. In order to provide access to public information on a matter which has detained the Senate and which has caused a great deal of debate, it would assist the parliamentary process if the Minister would ensure that the guidelines promulgated by the College, which are now to be used as the basis for making decisions with regard to vocational registration, were formally tabled in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to refer very briefly to the chapter relating to the Defence Force Ombudsman. It is interesting that the number of people going to see the Defence Force Ombudsman has fractionally reduced this year. I am glad of that. I would like to see the number reduced even further. By that I mean in no way to imply that the Defence Force Ombudsman is not doing a very important and valuable job. However, I regard the figure as somewhat of a barometer as to how well the military and the Department of Defence are dealing with matters relating to their own people. If the numbers of people who feel obliged to go outside their normal avenues for redress, to the Ombudsman, are reduced, that will be an indication that their problems are being solved within the normal channels. As I say, the numbers have slightly reduced this year. That includes the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority, the Defence Housing Authority, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Veterans' Review Board. The actual total of the Department of Defence, as compared with the three Services, is up just fractionally. So it is a bit of a mixed picture. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention to a few matters. A number of structural changes seem, to the Ombudsman, to have gone some way to improving the time taken by Defence to process or finalise complaints made to him. He reported a noticeable improvement as a result. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Indications over the three months of operation suggest that the new procedures will go a considerable was towards meeting these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>Those objectives are quality and timeliness of redress decisions. One of the most important things in getting help through an Ombudsman is to get a timely and qualitative redress. It has been drawn to our attention that the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary to the Department must both authorise an ex gratia payment. Of course, there are many occasions when the defence forces and the civilian part of the Department do not agree on issues. I believe that the Ombudsman's suggestion that this matter should be resolved is an important one. I hope that the Secretary, who is referred to on page 117 as having had his attention drawn to the matter, will very quickly put internal arrangements in place to obviate any possible problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to draw attention to concerns money which has been withheld by the Department, for whatever reason, for long periods and which is finally paid over to somebody who has made a complaint to the Ombudsman. There is presently no provision for interest to be paid on that money and it seems grossly unfair, when money is held for a couple of years or more, that interest should not be paid. The Ombudsman is seeking to have interest paid on that money. I hope that members of parliament will support the Ombudsman in his wish to see that introduced. Of course, the Ombudsman faces the continuing problem of lack of resources. He also draws attention to the fact that a cutback in resources bears very much more heavily on a small organisation such as the Ombudsman's office than it does on a large organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very important matter that the Parliament and all citizens should remember; that is, the Ombudsman is an independent office designed to protect the rights of citizens. From personal involvement I have had with the Ombudsman's office, I believe that the members of that office fulfil that role fantastically. They have given me a great deal of help when I have needed it in representing my constituents. There are many occasions when a member of parliament cannot have access to documents which are available to the Ombudsman. It is very important that the Ombudsman has the resources that are needed so as to maintain his independence and continue with the important work which he does for the citizen. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to the annual report 1988-89 of the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman. In his prefacing remarks to this report, the Ombudsman states that a most significant achievement of his office was the establishment that a fee for review of decisions being charged by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA) to review decisions was invalid. He deals with this matter in great detail in chapter 6 of the report, that is, the chapter on Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs complaints. In this section the Ombudsman states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The acceptance by DILGEA, after my intervention, that there was no legislative basis for the $240 fee it was charging applicants to the IRP attracted considerable attention. </PARA>
<PARA>Everyone who sits in this chamber knows that to be the case because that matter was brought before the Senate on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman remarks that some $2.7m had been collected since 1987. I remind honourable senators how that situation arose. In the August 1987 Budget, the Government announced that it would be charging a fee for review of change of status as far as prospective migrants were concerned. That fee was charged from September 1987 although the legislation did not come before the Senate until November that year. The clause which set out that this fee was to be charged was amended so that it was not present in the Migration Act. A number of us complained that the Government was continuing to charge that fee, but the Government indicated that it believed that it still had the right to do so, even though by that stage it had received legal advice that the fee was most likely unlawful as it was deemed to be a tax and not a fee at all. In the report the Ombudsman states:</PARA>
<PARA>My conclusions on the illegality of the fee were based on the various legal opinions available to DILGEA, including advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicating that, in the absence of legislation, the fee was probably unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department had also obtained an opinion from a Queen's Counsel that it had about a 60 per cent chance of winning any legal action in the courts with regard to the fee, but the Ombudsman remarks that this did not seem to be a particularly strong basis upon which to collect about $2.7m in fees. The Ombudsman continues:</PARA>
<PARA>I formally recommended that collection of the fees cease; that all fees collected should be refunded; and that no action be taken by DILGEA to recover its legal costs from my complainant. DILGEA accepted only the first of these recommendations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That recommendation was that collection of the fee should cease. That happened in March this year. The Ombudsman goes on to say that a compromise solution was reached after some discussion between the Minister and the Ombudsman. As a result of those discussions, fees were refunded to people who had paid them between 12 December 1988 and March this year. Also, anyone who had paid under protest before that date could recover fees on request. However, during the Estimates committee hearings it was revealed that very few people had requested that the fees be repaid to them. Of course, when people see on an application form that a fee is payable, they are hardly likely to protest that the fee is unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to this fee the Ombudsman also stated that one of the reasons the Department gave that it did not want to refund the money was that the $2.7m had already been spent. That seems to be a strange rationale. I am not quite sure how that will stand in a court of law when restitution is demanded for any other circumstances. The Ombudsman also states that with regard to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs a total of 883 complaints have been received this year, which is a significant increase. That is a rise of 78 per cent in written complaints and a rise of 23 per cent in oral complaints. So it appears that a great deal of the Ombudsman's time has been taken up with complaints of this Department. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of some concern to me that this may well be the last annual report of the Inter-State Commission. As a Tasmanian I have long regarded this body as being very important to our fair treatment at the hands of the Federal Government, no matter which party should be in power. It has maintained its role as an independent watchdog, which is the job given to it by the Australian Constitution. Its role is to look at trade and commerce and all laws made thereunder. Section 103 of the Constitution provides that the members of the Inter-State Commission shall hold tenure for seven years, shall receive remuneration, and cannot be removed during that time except on an address of both Houses of the Parliament for proved misbehaviour or incapacity. That independence was guaranteed in the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is effectively gutting that body and removing its ability to act as a watchdog. It is very clear why that is: the Government has not liked the results of the independent reports that it has received. A few months ago in this place we had condolences for the late Mr Justice Merv Everett, a fine lawyer and a fine Tasmanian. As a former member of the Australian Labor Party and a former senator he was still able to be independent in his decisions relating to the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. Against all the wishes of members of this Federal Labor Government who wanted the scheme cut back, he and his members were able to demonstrate the fairness of that scheme and the need for its maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> This Inter-State Commission has also brought down a number of other reports relating to transport and the need for micro-economic reform which this Government has studiously ignored and failed to pick up and do something with. However, it has also failed to consult the Inter-State Commission about the proposal to integrate that body with the Industry Commission. The Inter-State Commission took the view that aspects of its present role and function had not been considered in the Budget context. It had a duty and a right to put its views to the Government but those views were ignored. As the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the continuing role for the Inter-State Commission . . . is for the Commission to be a `free trade watchdog' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, this Government is not prepared to accept the reports that a free trade watchdog will give. Its role is to identify discrimination and preference in the operation of the Australian federal system. Its role is to draw attention to practices that are contrary to the national interest. This Government only looks after sectional interests; it is not interested in independent watchdogs who talk about the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Inter-State Commission should be allowed to continue. I presume that the Government is proposing to continue to pay these people to sit and do nothing. I will be interested to hear the Government's justification for that use of taxpayers' funds. I for one condemn the Government for its cynical exercise. It will be revealed to all and sundry, as the debate proceeds, exactly what the Government is up to. In the meantime, I take this opportunity to support the Inter-State Commission and to put on record the respect which those on this side of the House have for the reports of recent years which have come down from this body. They have been of vital importance in changing the national attitude to micro-economic reform-micro-economic reform which this Government has studiously ignored for the sake of the sectional interests represented by its mates in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. This Government parades its interest in the subject but actually does nothing. The Inter-State Commission, in its conclusion on page 24, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission considers that . . . the procedures developed by it and the perception that it is an independent, objective body is by virtue of its constitutional standing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In submitting the annual report of operations of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) for the year ended 30 June 1989, the President and the commissioners of the Inter-State Commission felt it necessary to include in the report not only details of projects undertaken during the year, but also some additional material in relation to the future of the Commission. If the Industry Commission Bill 1989, which is due to come before the Senate this week, is passed in the form proposed by the Government, the Inter-State Commission will be amalgamated with the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and the Business Regulation Review Unit to form the Industry Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The charter of this Industry Commission will be to become the Government's major review and inquiry body in industry matters. Included under industry matters would be all future references on transport matters, the only reference which the Inter-State Commission was chartered to investigate under the Inter-State Commission Act 1975. The ISC's annual report is really that body's only opportunity to voice its objection to the Industry Commission Bill. It is interesting that the commissioners do so and I consider that they were correct in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally, I object to the amalgamation of the roles of the IAC and the Inter-State Commission. I do so on three principal grounds. Firstly, I believe that it would be constitutionally incorrect to incorporate the Inter-State Commission into what is essentially a government-controlled body. The Inter-State Commission was established under the Constitution as an administrative body with `such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary . . . relating to trade and commerce and of all laws made thereunder'. The only way to assess the constitutional consistency of the amalgamation would be through the High Court of Australia. However, there is unlikely to be a High Court challenge. The Inter-State Commission is to be left with no resources to mount one and, at this stage, there has been no indication that any of the States will intervene on its behalf. We sincerely hope they do. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I deplore the manner in which the Government has gone about deciding to amalgamate the Inter-State Commission and the IAC. It made this decision without any consultation with the Inter-State Commission. Thirdly, the role of the ISC is to be an objective arm's length body examining and advising on matters of trade and commerce that require a balance of national and State interests or of competing State interests. It is not in the best interests of this country to have this body under the control of the government of the day and, therefore, subject to its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the achievements of the Inter-State Commission for the last financial year, the year saw the publication of the Commission's report on the harmonisation of road vehicle regulation in Australia and its preliminary and final reports resulting from its waterfront investigation. On the waterfront investigation, I believe that it was the special independent status of the Inter-State Commission which allowed it to win the confidence and cooperation of the States and, thus, undertake this study successfully. This independence would be lost upon amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator from Tasmania, like Senator Newman, I am particularly aware of the expertise of the Inter-State Commission in the area of transport, and here I speak with reference to the work done by the Inter-State Commission with regard to the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. I commend the Inter-State Commission on its work over the years and particularly during the last financial year. I register my disapproval at the move by the Government to amalgamate the Inter-State Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>We have before us an issues paper entitled Teacher Quality which was prepared by the Schools Council for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. This interesting paper has been in circulation in the education sector for some time and there have been quite a number of responses to it. In the short time available, I wish to draw attention to a small number of matters. The paper contains nine very interesting recommendations and eight suggestions. Suggestion No. 2 is crucial and urgent and I hope that the Government will do something about it before the new academic year begins. The suggestion is:</PARA>
<PARA>That, as the Schools Council believes that sooner or later four-year training must be a necessary minimum for the great majority of teachers, more data be gathered on its costs and on the scaled implementation related to the supply and demand situation. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not concerned about that. Rather, the paper draws attention to a problem which is occurring from the amalgamation of colleges of advanced education (CAEs), which generally have three-year teacher training courses, and universities, which tend to have four-year teacher training courses. When those CAEs are amalgamated, most of the courses will become degree courses. So there will be quite a number of three-year degree courses in teaching and another lot of four-year degree courses. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the attractiveness for teachers, it is obvious that the three-year courses will win out-a teacher will be able to get into the classroom a year earlier, earn a living a year earlier and receive exactly the same type of recognition in the education community as teachers who have completed a four-year course. If the Government is genuine about wanting a four-year-trained teaching force, as I think there should be in this country, it will have to move very rapidly to do something about this anomaly that has arisen directly as a result of the Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion, which is also extremely important, states:</PARA>
<PARA>That higher educational institutions continue to explore and research selection processes to improve the likelihood of those admitted to teacher education courses being suitable for teaching. </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment there is a dearth of applicants for teaching. This fact was exemplified by the main newspaper in my State, the Courier-Mail, which reported that one of the top people in mathematics graduating from school this year said that he would need to have his head read if he thought of going into teaching. With that type of attitude abroad, where the best in the community see teaching as an also-ran profession, we are on a slippery road to where the United States currently is with teachers being paid about the same as bus and tram conductors and being valued at about the same level. If we want that situation, we are heading in the right direction. Unless the teaching profession is given the right kind of resources and status, we will be proceeding down that very slippery road, no matter what other type of so-called economic moves this or any other government wishes to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other item I wish to refer to relates to the section of the paper that deals with students with disabilities. It is unfortunate that the paper falls into the identical trap that most people who talk about disabilities fall into. It talks only about what we can do for students with disabilities. In terms of attracting teachers for children who have learning, physical or emotional disabilities, it never mentions the fact that we should be seeking actively to encourage people with disabilities to enter the teaching profession. There is absolutely no mention in the paper that they would be extremely well qualified to teach as they themselves suffer from disabilities and would know what it is like to exist in our community with those disabilities. As with anybody else in our community, a large number of those people would be very well qualified if they were trained. It is a pity that there is no mention of or support given to that aspect in this paper on teacher quality. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper itself is excellent. I recommend it to honourable senators to read because teacher quality will be the major ongoing debate over the next few years in education. This paper is an excellent start. I think it shows that we have in the National Board of Employment, Education and Training a body that is willing to tackle the major issues that are emerging in the profession. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper is the annual report regarding consultants engaged under Section 4 of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984. It relates to the use of ministerial consultants by the Government. Although the figure is not shown, from answers to separate questions that have been asked by me and others the fact is that in 1988-89 no less than $2m of taxpayers' money was expended by the Government on the use of ministerial consultants. That represents a sixfold increase over the last five years. The total cost of the use of ministerial consultants since 1984 is a staggering $7.5m. That figure is not contained in the annual report. The cost of consultants as well as the details of them ought to be included in this annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of consultants employed by Ministers has got absolutely out of hand. There has been an enormous increase in the number of staff resources available to Ministers in the life of the Hawke Government. The growing use of consultants is only one of numerous ways in which the resources have been built up. It is nothing less than a backdoor way of getting around the staff ceilings that are supposed to apply to ministerial staff, just as they apply to Public Service staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of consultants is extraord- inarily extravagant. If one looks at the list of consultants, containing their names and the uses to which they are being put, one has no doubt that the Government is using this section of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act to enable ex-Labor members of Parliament, Labor Party candidates and Labor Party apparatchiks to be employed and to earn a few dollars-in fact, many dollars-at taxpayers' expense. There are some notable exceptions, but the list of names of the consultants who have been engaged by the Government in the last 12 months, in 1989-90, reads like a Who's Who of the Labor Party. That is a continuation of the trend that has occurred in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I and many others on this side of the chamber have continued to draw attention to what we believe is a blatant abuse of this Act of Parliament and a blatant abuse of the taxpayers of Australia. It is time this came to a halt in the interests of proper administration. If we expect to have the people of Australia pulling in their belts as the Government asks them to do and restraining demand, to see the Ministers of the Government squandering taxpayers' money on this use of consultants in a way that is, as I said, deliberately designed to get around the normally accepted procedures and rules applying to the engagement of staff of Ministers sets an extraordinarily bad example indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be a requirement that the cost of consultants be a separate Budget item. That does not apply at the moment. The cost of consultants is hidden in the Budget Papers. It is regarded as a running cost. There is no budgeted item. There is no proper opportunity for review of those costs by the Senate, by the Estimates committees or by the Parliament. Major reforms need to be undertaken in terms of that issue and other issues that relate to the engagement of consultants on Ministers' staffs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report relating to the fitout works for the Australian Taxation Office in six leased office buildings in Box Hill and Moonee Ponds, Victoria, Adelaide and Perth is the first of a series of the similar proposals the Committee will be examining. As the functional requirements of the Taxation Office are similar at each location, each building will provide approximately 20,000 square metres of office space, ground floor shopfront space and a restricted staff entry point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the fitout proposals stems from three factors, which are the Australian Taxation Office's computer re-equipment program, office decentralisation policy, and modernised accommodation requirements. The Australian Taxation Office is undertaking a major computer re-equipment program and a survey of its office accommodation has shown that the majority is technically unsuitable for the installation of new equipment. The Government has approved a leasing program for the Australian Taxation Office which will enable it to place staff and equipment in purpose-designed buildings by mid-1992. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Australian Taxation Office is implementing a policy of decentralising its larger offices from the central business districts of major cities to suburban or country sites and modernising its accommodation requirements based on a space allocation of 20 square metres per employee. The Committee believes that the proposal will provide a better working environment for staff, lead to improvements in efficiency and productivity and provide a better service to the public. The estimated cost of the proposal is $46.1m at July 1989 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report relates to the need for the provision of an additional apron facility at Sydney Airport. There is currently a shortage of domestic apron facilities at Sydney Airport to accommodate jet aircraft, ranging from small corporate jets to large, wide-bodied domestic aircraft. The situation is expected to become more critical following deregulation of the domestic aviation industry on 1 November 1990. The Federal Airports Corporation has received 23 applications from existing and potential new tenants for expansion of existing facilities or for new developments where apron frontage sites are required. The Committee believes that this need exists regardless of whether a third runway is built in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Towards the end of the sitting last night I was referring to the position of full bore rifle clubs around Australia, the representative body of which is the National Rifle Association of Australia. Some time last year an attempt was made by the Department of Defence to move responsibility for the full bore rifle clubs away from under the umbrella of the Department of Defence and with the States, under the various State laws. Following representations that the Opposition received from the rifle clubs around Australia and their associations we decided to take the opposing view and, with the help of the Australian Democrats, the regulations were defeated and the status quo remained. There are various reasons for keeping the system as it is. Briefly, we need a uniformity of laws pertaining to this sport throughout Australia. We can have uniformity in other sports throughout Australia, but there are very few sports which require people to carry arms interstate. Full bore rifle shooters could have great problems if there were six different sets of laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Rifle Association of Australia has been under the umbrella of the Department of Defence since 1904-just about as long as the time since Federation. The original purpose was to provide training for marksmen for use in wars should the need arise. Marksmen from the movement served with distinction in both world wars. Now in more modern times we have national and international competition, and considering the matter of safety on ranges the system should remain as it is. I know that certain representations have been made since the regulations were defeated for the Rifle Association personnel to get around the table with Department of Defence officers to work out a suitable solution. I ask what progress, if any, has been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were some discussions between the Department of Defence and the rifle clubs. At those discussions the Department put a number of proposals to the National Rifle Association of Australia and asked it to consider them. It was given several months to give an answer. It then requested an extension of time because it was seeking some legal advice. After that, the chief Defence negotiator was on sick leave, which delayed the process, and the difficult situation that we have had with the pilots has kept it going a bit longer. I understand that a meeting between the Department and the Association is set down for 15 December. I will be happy to report to Senator Panizza on progress after that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the matter of the use of Army ranges by rifle clubs around Australia. Part of the deal has been that the rifle clubs have had the use of Army ranges, and vice versa. Certain ranges have been leased by the Department of Defence to the rifle associations. I believe that even a private range owned by the Rifle Association of Victoria is used by the Army. The Government's idea in the past few years of selling off ranges has been a worry for the associations. In the case of Sydney and Perth and, I believe, Brisbane, a compensation agreement has been in position since 1904 or 1905, whereby if the Army decided to sell off the ranges the clubs would be compensated not only for losing the use of the facility but also for facilities that were erected on the ranges by the associations over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that in Adelaide and Melbourne there was a great oversight, and with different executive officers being involved with the associations there was a misunderstanding in relation to the agreement between the Department of Defence and the rifle associations of Victoria and South Australia. Although the agreement previously existed, either it was not put in writing or it is no longer around. When the Williamstown rifle range in Victoria was sold the clubs had to move to another place, without compensation. Does the Minister have any idea of varying these agreements that are in place with Sydney, Perth and Brisbane? Also, will he consider compensating the Rifle Association of South Australia, which is the next worrying one, and the Rifle Association of Victoria-even though no-one seems to be able to get hold of the agreement which apparently was in place originally? In the case of Adelaide it could be able to move elsewhere if the Department of Defence decides to sell the range, as was the case in Williamstown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that the agreement for compensation has relevance for the Anzac Range in Sydney but not for the others. Senator Panizza also referred to the Williamstown range, and I am advised that the Rifle Association of Victoria had a look at its legal position and decided not to pursue compensation in the courts. Honourable senators will appreciate that litigation is currently proceeding between the Commonwealth and the association in Sydney over the proposed sale of the Malabar range. I am not certain to what extent I should comment, given that the case is actually proceeding. I prefer to leave that matter. I am not advised of any compensation plan for any other range. I am happy to take up the honourable senator's suggestion with the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) but so far there are no plans, as far as I am aware, for compensation should clubs be moved off ranges where the Commonwealth is seeking to sell the land.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his reply, and I certainly do not want him to comment about the Anzac Range, as that matter is sub judice. I know there is an agreement in relation to the Anzac range and in Brisbane, but I will not comment about Brisbane because there is no suggestions of a shift. I am led to believe there is no proposal in relation to Perth. There is a rumble about the Department of Defence doing something in Adelaide. However, I understand the position as stated by the Minister. I know that the Rifle Association of Victoria has decided, after seeking legal advice, not to pursue compensation. As I said before, their situation is affected by the passage of time. Nearly 100 years, give or take seven or eight years, has passed since the agreements were put in place, and in a lot of cases it might even have been a gentlemen's agreement; I do not know. That does not mean that the Government or the Department should not listen to points made and consider the matter of compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During last night and this morning the Department of Defence has set to work in an attempt to answer the honourable senator's queries. In respect of questions about Operation Immune, the honourable senator referred to liability in relation to service aircraft. The original question was actually asked by Senator Michael Baume and a response was provided to him on 9 November. I have a copy here that I will table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman asked about the agreement with the airlines. Again, that question was asked by Senator Baume and the response provided to him on 9 November. Senator Newman also asked about costings. A check of the records reveals that the honourable senator asked for costings on the Boeing 707s, and they were provided on 9 November. I have here the equivalent data for the other two aircraft types and I will table that. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a question about ministerial direction. The Minister of Defence is now able to produce the document, and I have a copy here. I have now dealt with all the questions raised in relation to Operation Immune. There was then a question about the review of service allowances. The schedule was provided to the Committee secretariat this morning, and there is probably no need for me to table that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the Arthur Young report, it is being printed and the Minister for Defence will decide on the date of release when it is available to him. I think that I answered the questions on the Sanderson review yesterday; the report will be tabled soon by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman then asked several questions concerning Arvin Consultancy Pty Ltd. It will be simplest if I go through these matters, as they are not unimportant. The honourable senator asked on what occasion the Minister for Defence visited New Zealand in relation to the frigates contract. The Minister visited New Zealand five times. On each occasion a number of issues were raised; the frigate project was only one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked whom the Minister saw when he was in New Zealand and the answer is that he saw almost everybody: Government Ministers and officials, Opposition frontbenchers, other parliamentarians, members of the armed forces, industrialists, businessmen, unionists, protesters and, of course, journalists. Mr Hickman did not accompany the Minister to New Zealand on any of these visits. He was never responsible in the Minister's office for solely handling the frigate project. It was always the responsibility of a number of people in the Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman asked on how many occasions the Minister and Mr Hickman met with representatives from AWS and AMECON, where the meetings were and what matters were discussed. I do not think anybody could give a table on this. The Minister, Mr Hickman and other staff members who were responsible made themselves available to both AMECON and AWS whenever the consortia sought to speak to them. They discussed whatever the consortia chose to raise with them within the bounds of probity and recognising the distance which naturally the Minister and his office wanted to maintain from the tender evaluation process. That is the extent of the response I have and I will now table the documents to which I have referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answers and I wonder what was so difficult that it has taken from 10 October to give me those answers. Clearly the questions may not have been able to be answered on the night but they must have got bogged down in the Minister's office en route, because there is no other indication in the answers just given for the need to take to 28 November to give them to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also curious at the response about Mr Hickman having responsibility in the office for the AMECON project. I noticed the emphasis placed by the Minister on the word `sole' in that reply. I also draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, on press releases being issued out of the office of the Minister for Defence at that time, the contact person for the frigate project was in fact Mr Hickman. So, while he may not have had sole responsibility, he clearly was authorised to speak on behalf of the Minister to all who wished to discuss that matter at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have not yet seen those answers, I have not had the benefit of studying them. I will do so closely when I receive them. I also thank the Minister for his other answers. He gave the impression that I had not in fact asked for the costs of the three classes of aircraft, but that is not so. In fact, page 313 of Estimates Committee D Hansard showed that I twice asked about this in the one area of questioning. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to see what the subsidy is per hour on each of the three classes of aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to know how much per hour that is for each of the three classes of aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on again, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think I have made my wishes known. If you can supply them, I would be very grateful. </PARA>
<PARA>The Acting Chairman, who I think was Senator Cooney, said:</PARA>
<PARA>You have done it very lucidly. </PARA>
<PARA>So, clearly Senator Cooney had no problem understanding exactly what I wanted. I am grateful those answers have now arrived. I would not want to be seen to be niggling at the hour of finally receiving the information for which I have waited so long. As I have said, I appreciate the fact that the other material has arrived. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the list of allowances which has been waiting for attention in the Department of Industrial Relations, I find that rather curious, because it does not include any reference to the allowance for hazardous service for the men posted to the Iran-Iraq border peacekeeping force. That determination has finally been made, and I understand it was determined on 16 November. It is now 28 November. I understand from the answer which has just been given to me that this was a list of matters under review at the Department of Industrial Relations as at 7 November. How is it, then, that the Iran-Iraq allowance was not listed as needing attention on 7 November?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, may I take the opportunity of apologising to Senator Newman. There is no question that, at the page of Hansard to which she has just referred, she did ask for all of the information. I apologise that I did not acknowledge as much in my answer. Senator Newman is quite right and I am not. Senator Newman then asked a question about this list of service allowances. The reason why the hazardous service allowance was not on it is that it had been settled prior to today and I think the Department saw no need to include it, given that the matter had been decided. However, I admit that, given a description of the matters under consideration at 7 November, it probably should have been there. It was not simply because it had been decided in the interim.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. As he will be well aware, I have been concerned about this allowance for a long time. I have asked him questions about it in the chamber over a long period and I am delighted to think it has finally been determined. Clearly, the situation is no longer so dangerous that the departmental officers could not make the trip and assess the danger. Nonetheless, it is welcome. I recall that during the hearing there was a suggestion that perhaps the allowance would not be backdated. I threatened to go to the Department of Industrial Relations and frighten the life out of people there. I do not know whether it was the departmental officials or my threat that did it, but whichever it was I am glad to see that it has, in fact, been backdated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I now move away from the specific questions and look, instead, at the report of Estimates Committee D to the Senate. There are a number of items relating to the Department of Defence which concerned the Committee. They are: assistance to the civil community; the Sanderson report; whether the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal is in breach of its statutory obligation under section 58 (h) (6) relating to the review of pay and allowances every two years; and the purchase of 15 light armoured vehicles-the LAV25-in a rather unusual manner, partly in that it was very speedy compared with the norm in the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would first like to speak about the Sanderson report. I expressed concern during the hearing in fairly trenchant terms, and my colleagues were fully prepared to support me in my criticism. This study by General Sanderson needed to take place. However, I feel that it was flawed from the beginning in the terms of reference which the general was given. I mean, in particular, that he was not proceeding parallel with an equivalent, concurrent civilian study, which I think is desperately needed in the Department. He was restricted as to what he could look at under his terms of reference. I see we have a copy of the terms of reference now. The general was told to look at a number of things. One was that, in the logistics area, he could look at removing any duplication between service officers and commands, as far as is practicable. That highlights to me the fact that there was any amount of duplication and wasted effort in terms of military and civilian work in a variety of areas in the Department, but he was not given a similar instruction to look at removing any duplication between military and civilian employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 6 of his directive he was told that the nature of the structural changes envisaged could affect departmental structures and working arrangements, and he was to consult with relevant areas in the Department and identify areas in which his proposals might impact on civilian staffing arrangements. It was a bit like telling him to go out and do the job with one hand behind his back. What is desperately needed is a total review of the civilian and military interface-to use a word I cannot bear. If the waste through double-guessing that we know goes on in the Department could have been studied, or the two areas of the Department-the civilian and military areas-could have been studied concurrently, we might have had a result of more long term value to the defence of Australia and the morale of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that Mr McLeod, the Deputy Secretary, Budget and Management, said that the Secretary had done an equivalent civilian review but when he was asked further about the matter he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary's review has not been contained in a single report as such, as was the case with the Sanderson report. It has been the sum of a number of different reviews and exercises of restructuring within the Department that have occurred as part of the normal process of review. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked whether there was any reason why the Secretary's review could not be made public as will happen with the Sanderson report. Mr McLeod said:</PARA>
<PARA>In some cases there would have been documents which would have given rise to the Secretary considering his options as to the manner in which the top structure of the Department should be reorganised. </PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The results of that review process are not necessarily fully reflected in a documentary form. </PARA>
<PARA>He never really came to grips with why there could not be any public study of what had been happening in these so-called reviews of the civilian side. I, for one, have my doubts about how much civilian review there has been. It seems to me that every time I try to ask questions about redundancies or rationalisation on the civilian side of the Department there is simply a shuffling of figures which draws rather heavily on the fact that a number of people have been moved out of the former Office of Defence Production into Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd and Australian Defence Industries and that is really not what I am on about at all. I am looking to see how that Department can be fined down to be an effective and efficient body. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning again to General Sanderson's report, its implementation is taking place and is expected to be finalised by February next year. The Committee found, and said so in its report, that factors of its implementation were quite discriminatory; there was quite inappropriate treatment of military officers compared with civilian officers who have been made redundant and no attempt was being made to treat service positions with the same redeployment opportunities which are offered to senior public servants. I and my colleagues believe that it should be within the competence of the Department of Defence to actively seek redeployment for displaced officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter relating to the Sanderson report which I find particularly offensive is that, even to this date, I understand that officers who have been fingered for redundancy have not been told specifically what their redundancy packages will be. They have no choice in the matter. They are being compulsorily made redundant. They have a gun at their heads but they do not yet know what their financial package will be. They do not know what they will get or when they will get it. How can anyone in that position make plans or work out finances? It is one of the most badly managed manpower cases I have ever come across. It is disgraceful in the extreme that there has been no public protest from the Defence Force leadership. It is also despicable that two Ministers for Defence have allowed this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are all very well aware of the terrible wastage rates from the defence forces, which are continuing. One of the reasons for the wastage spelled out in the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which reported last November, a year ago, was that the defence forces felt that they had little or no support from either their political or military leaders. The way in which the Sanderson report is being implemented is a classic case of lack of support. Just before I finish talking about the lack of support that we give to our servicemen, I draw attention to a plight facing some servicemen, although not a great number. It is a case of lack of understanding of the special requirements put on people who are asked to move from place to place for the sake of their country. This Government has failed them in the ways that really show that their service is important and that therefore as people and as human beings they deserve protection. I am talking about a case-there are increasing numbers of such cases-where a father has gone through the divorce courts and has the custody of his children. Such a man is not entitled to a married quarter in the Australian Defence Force, even if he has his mother to keep house for him. </PARA>

Surely a man who does not have a dependent spouse but who has dependent children living with him should be entitled to a married quarter and, therefore, removal expenses. After all, such a man would need that married quarter and removal expenses because he does not live where he chooses to live but where the Defence Force requires him to live and he has to move where the Defence Force requires him to move.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is best to take the last point first. Senator Newman is simply not correct. It has always been the case-I suppose `always' is a big word, but it has been the case for a long time-that the test is one of dependency, not marriage. Senator Newman referred to fathers. If a service father can demonstrate that he has dependent children, he is eligible for married quarters; there is no question about that. I invite Senator Newman to ask the person whom she alleges has complained to her to contact either me or the Department because her information is simply not right. There must be some other element in play of which we are not aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not quite certain what to say about the general thrust of Senator Newman's remarks concerning lack of support for service personnel, except that, if they are looking for support, they will not go to Senator Newman. Redundancy issues are never easy. When people are made redundant, inevitably there will be a certain amount of discomfort and pain. That cannot be avoided. But from the outset we have sought to minimise that discomfort and we will continue to do so. The redundancy package for the people in question has been agreed to. All those affected are aware of what is in the package and we expect final Department of Industrial Relations approval in a very short period. </PARA>
<PARA> To go back further to those things that led up to this, it is sufficient to say that the Sanderson review certainly looked at the issue of logistics, including in the Department. Since the end of October we now have a new organisation in place which incorporates the Secretary's review of logistics and its recommendations. </PARA>

At that stage they knew it was still subject to approval, which made them all feel very uncertain. Even if the Minister does not think that that is uncertain, they do. They did not know the financial details; they only knew the principles on which the package would be based, which was leading to very great unhappiness in the people to whom I have spoken. The Minister has said that the time of redundancy is never very happy; but at least it is a lot better if redundancy is an option or if one is given help in finding alternative employment. These people have not had any assistance with redeployment, according to the questions we asked and the answers we got during the Estimates committee hearings. They are being treated completely differently from those in the Senior Executive Service in the Public Service in that the Defence Force personnel have no choice in the matter; they are being made compulsorily redundant. In those circumstances one would expect the financial package to be more generous than the standard package offered to people who choose redundancy.</PARA></TALK.START>

Would he also answer exactly what he meant when he vaguely mentioned that people are being redeployed in the Public Service?

At the Estimates Committee D hearing-indeed, in the report-there were questions that related to redeploy of officers in this position to the Australian Public Service. That is why I raised the question. It is in the report and I am attempting to answer the queries that have been raised there.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will move on to another item that has been commented on in the report; that is, the purchase of the LAV 25 armoured fighting vehicles. In this case $25m was allocated for the initial purchase of 15 LAV 25 wheeled armoured fighting vehicles from the United States Marine Corps, including spare parts. The cost of the initial purchase was about $25m. The Committee was not informed of the processes undertaken to access the priority of this need relative to requirements for other equipment and stores. The Committee reported that it considers that the purchase of the vehicles would be an appropriate matter for review by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or another parliamentary committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This purchase was not mentioned in the Additional Estimates in April. We were told that the resources came from the existing appropriation for equipment and stores, but we were not informed of the process undertaken to get the priority, as I have just said. No arrangements were made to ascertain any Australian industry participation in any additional purchase, and yet we have been told by the Minister that we will need 100. This has added $25m to our balance of payments problem. The vehicles have not been trialled in Australian conditions; they were not evaluated against possible competitors; there are no reports that assess whether a wheeled or a track vehicle was more suitable for our climatic conditions and terrain in the north of Australia where the 2 Cavalry Regiment will be relocated, and these vehicles are for 2 Cavalry Regiment. The Committee had been told last year that one of these vehicles was to come to Australia with the Americans for trials during Kangaroo 89. That did not happen. The first thing we knew was that the Government had bought 15 of them. Major-General Francis, Assistant Chief of Materiel for the Army, confirmed this at the Estimates Committee hearings. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There was no comparative physical trial or competing vehicles: that is correct . . . we did move very quickly, and we short-circuited the system when the opportunity arose. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be true to say that we have any recommendations that put the LAV above the other contenders. It is our assessment that this vehicle is probably the best . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly the way I would have imagined the taxpayers of Australia would expect defence procurement to operate. Certainly it usually operates on the same basis as anybody with hardening of the arteries-with great difficulty. It is so out of character for any purchases of any magnitude-even small ones for that matter-in the Defence Department to proceed at that pace. One really does wonder how this was allowed to go ahead. I have my suspicions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ives, First Assistant Secretary, Resources and Financial Programs Division, suggested that the $25m had to be spent before 30 June, if I recall. I could think of plenty more deserving things that $25m could have been spent on-personnel for one. If it has to come from the same vote, then I regard other areas as more needy. I would have thought that the Defence Department might have moved, first of all, to improve our defence capability and, secondly, to improve our morale. If the Minister has a look at Puckapunyal, for example, he will see that we are short of spare parts for the existing tanks and the armoured personnel carriers. The Armoured Regiment at Puckapunyal at the moment has four tanks without engines at all. God knows what it will do in an emergency. These tanks have been cannibalised for their parts to keep the others running. There is a long time delay in getting spare parts throughout the Defence Force but particularly with the Armoured Corps. This is having an enormous effect on morale. The purchase of the LAVs before dealing with these essentials only exacerbates the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> When I asked Major-General Francis whose idea it was to purchase these vehicles, I was told it was collectively that of the Army, the Defence Force and the Department in conjunction with the Minister. Of course it had to go to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to get his approval. I then asked whether it was the Minister's idea and Major-General Francis said, `I think the Minister's interest in this project is well known'.That says it all. That is our Rambo at it again. I believe that the all-party committee--</PARA>

<PARA> I would now like to raise what is perhaps a much smaller matter: flying suits. There is a shortage of flying suits. There has been for several years. I was told at the Estimates Committee hearings that the problem was that we wanted a two-piece flying suit as opposed to the one-piece suit used by the Americans. I was not told why we needed a two-piece suit. No definite answer was given, just a vague indication that it was the preference of the aviators. I have a copy of the Army supply bulletin which has the Nomex flying suits shown on the sensitive list. The list as at August 1989, headed `Sensitive Items', states:</PARA>
<PARA>Procurement of Nomex flying suits has been delayed since 1983 due to the unsuitability of the US one piece coverall and the new RAAF 2-piece suit. Depot stocks have been exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on in some detail about the matter:</PARA>
<PARA>Delivery is near completion. Units are not to demand for the new item as issues will be made in accordance with priorities laid down by Army Office. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>An EDD of early 1990 has been confirmed for these suits. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it quite extraordinary that the provision of flying suits has been delayed since 1983. I am further amazed that although the specifications for the two-piece flying suit were ready in 1987-two years ago-they still will not be ready until early 1990, given the urgency of an item that has been sensitive for six years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of Senator Newman's comments, I think it is necessary to look at the purchase of the light armoured vehicles (LAV). I will just give a little background to that matter. Fourteen LAV-25s and one LAVR wheeled armoured fighting vehicle have been acquired for delivery by mid-1990. The requirement for the wheeled armoured fighting vehicles was not recently identified, but it was identified in 1987 as a priority in the Government's White Paper, which looked at a requirement for rapid and effective ground force operations across northern Australia. It is not difficult to understand why high priority was given to the acquisition of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles in time for the 2 Cavalry Regiment's planned move to Darwin in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The LAV-25 has been under consideration for two years or more as part of the development of the wheeled armoured fighting vehicle proposal. The Chief of the Defence Force advised that the purchase of the LAVs was necessary to evaluate operational concepts for the wheeled armoured fighting vehicles in northern Australia. As I think Senator Newman mentioned, about 100 vehicles may eventually be acquired, depending on funding priorities. I could not give an absolute time for that acquisition. The procurement was made under United States foreign military sales regulations, which enable the vehicles to be acquired very quickly. The then Acting Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) agreed with that approach. A logistics and training package is included in the intitial cost of about $25m, which compares very favourably with vehicles of similar capability. By procuring vehicles from the LAV family, Australia has been able to take advantage of the Marine Corps' extensive comparative evaluation of armoured vehicles, including trials in a wide range of climatic conditions and terrains. </PARA>
<PARA> The LAV was one of a limited number of vehicles that could provide the capability sought by the Army. In addition to the advantage of its immediate availability, life support costs for the vehicle are expected to be significantly less than those for comparable vehicles due to our access to US logistic support systems. When it is appropriate-and I think what I have just said lends weight to the argument that it was-defence equipment acquisition can take place with some flexibility in procurement procedures. This was an opportunity that was too good to miss and we did not miss it. That is why it was not included in the 1988-89 Additional Estimates. Due to the size of this initial procurement, the potential for Australian industry participation was limited. Obviously, it will not be ignored and it will certainly be an important factor when the main component of the need for wheeled armoured fighting vehicles is considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman referred at one point to some tanks which have been cannibalised for spares. We are awaiting tank spares from Germany as part of a normal order. I am advised that there is no evidence of operational shortfalls due to spares shortages for tanks in any event. In the current strategic circumstances, tanks are not of the highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now go to the question of flying suits. Army pilots and crew obviously spend quite a lot of time not dressed in flying suits; they do not fly 24 hours a day. During those periods on the ground, like the rest of us they want to be comfortable and they need a uniform that is versatile and suited to ground operations. A two-piece flying suit is cooler and more comfortable in that it allows for better air circulation around the body. It is less restrictive than a one-piece suit. Additionally, it may be worn with the shirt tucked in or left out. The two-piece suit also offers extra fire protection on the waist-thigh area when the shirt is worn inside the trousers and gives a greater range of movement for the upper body than does a one-piece suit. The one-piece suit needs to be fitted more precisely than the two-piece suit-I am sure it does-with the resultant need to provide a greater size range than for the two-piece suit. The two-piece suit is cheaper to maintain because the whole uniform need not be discarded if only one part is worn or damaged. For all these reasons the Army prefers to use a two-piece suit. I understand that a prototype has been produced. I am not certain of the stage that that is up to. I seek Senator Newman's indulgence in allowing me some time to find out. </PARA>

We recall that, in 1987, Senator Tate tabled a report on fraud which gave instructions to departments to get moving and to put control and review measures in place. It has taken the Defence Department two years to do that. I am very glad to recognise that it has, but I am concerned that it has been such a slow action. When we compare how quickly that Department could spend $25m on some light armoured vehicles and how slowly it has put in place measures which could be saving it many millions of dollars if fraud is taking place in that Department to any level, it is a bit of an irony that one could be so quick and one could be so slow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it is fair to give the impression that the Department or the Services generally were not concerned about the prospect of fraud and were not doing anything about it. We had an Inspector-General, we were using the military apparatus and we had quite an extensive set-up for looking at fraud. As a final phase of developing an approach to ensuring that fraud is minimised or eliminated, it was decided to add that extra element of the Australian Federal Police. But there was already in place a very active anti-fraud grouping within the Department, and I think that showed the Department's bona fides in wanting to eliminate even the possibility of fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>

But as it has taken over 12 months to put into place two Federal policemen who were offered by the Australian Federal Police all that time ago, and as it has taken the Department two years actually to announce its fraud control plan, I do not find his answer very convincing. I have the press release of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) dated 22 November-which was Wednesday last week-in which he stressed the importance which the Government attaches to the identification and prevention of fraud. The Government certainly does not move very fast if it regards fraud as important. I would have thought that it could have moved a lot faster for something it thought was important. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The report of Estimates Committee D also referred to assistance to the civil community. That was referred to in the majority report and it was also referred to in a reservation by my colleagues Senators MacGibbon and Reid and me. We have very serious concerns about assistance to the civil community. We followed this matter in some detail during the Estimates Committee hearings and we were not satisfied by the answers we got. I have a copy of a document entitled Defence Instructions (General) DI(G) 01-2-which was issued pursuant to section 9a of the Defence Act 1903 and sets down the policy and procedures for aid to the civil community. We asked a lot of questions about that document and it was made clear to us that the document really had a persuasive influence on the Department and the defence forces and it gave them a guide. I could get out the Hansard now, if I chose to, and go through all the words that were used to suggest to us that it was an indication of how the defence forces should operate. At no time was there any suggestion that Defence Instructions (General), were referred to and allowed for in the Defence Act and that the Department was bound to operate according to the procedures laid down. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the officers who were answering our questions described those defence instructions as merely self-imposed disciplines or general policy statements. Specific questions as to whether the DI(G) applied to the provision of the aircraft for the civilian air lift known as Operation Immune were simply avoided in the officers' answers. In the Estimates Committee hearing officers revealed in answers to us that Defence had provided the aircraft following a decision of Cabinet and through instructions subsequently issued by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). It does not appear that the Minister gave any instruction which would have overruled the procedures laid down in the DI(G). From the evidence which we received at the Estimates Committee, it appears that the Defence Instructions (General) were simply ignored because the Minister had said there was a Cabinet decision to use Royal Australian Air Force aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one thing. However, I have here a copy of a document which makes it very clear that the Defence Instructions (General) have the force of law and that it is mandatory for the Department to follow them. I fail to understand why the Department did not treat its own Defence Instructions (General) as having the force of law when it was well aware that it had an opinion from the Attorney-General's Department which said that it was obliged to implement its own Defence Instructions (General). Perhaps the Minister could explain to this chamber why it was not given that authority in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any suggestion that officers of the Department of Defence, or anyone from the forces, attempted to mislead the Committee is something that I must strongly resist. I think it would have been reasonable for those officials to assume that Committee members would be aware that the Defence Act is the only authority for the issue of Defence Instructions (General). They would not have felt the need to point that out. They would have assumed that degree of knowledge. So, I do not find that any sort of problem. Then we get to the nature of the instructions themselves. The instructions are written for the internal administration of Defence Force procedures. They are not, and never have been, all embracing, and no-one has ever suggested that they were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Defence Act makes it clear that the Government, through the Minister, can assign tasks to the forces as seen fit. If and when the Minister or the Government decides to issue an instruction to the forces and it contravenes Defence general instructions, so be it. That is quite properly within the Act and quite properly within the power of the Government and the Minister. In these circumstances the Department would go to the Minister and say, `This is the way we would normally conduct ourselves in this situation'. Obviously, it is then up to the Government to decide whether that is adequate in the circumstances that are prevailing at the time. On this occasion, one would have to say that the circumstances prevailing were not only different from normal but extraordinary, to say the least. The Government, therefore, needed to take action and instructed the forces accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a very close friend of the Minister, David Simmons, for many years. I have not had any battles with David Simmons and do not anticipate having any. He and I are the closest of friends. We have not been at war either on a major scale or on the most minor. I think Senator Baume misunderstands the process. I think the program itself misunderstood the process and that is perhaps why Senator Baume does. If one were to look at who might have talked to a journalist on this question, the areas in which one would have to look are simply far too great. I could not promise to cover as an example those who prepared the document, their company and those to whom they might have shown documents. It simply would not be possible. So I do not propose to take action. I do not regard this as that serious a matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I do not regard this matter as being as serious as Senator Baume seems to regard it is that I understand the process, and that is that the proponent-in this case, the Department of Defence-hires a consultant to prepare a draft of an environmental impact statement. That is what has happened at Jervis Bay-a draft. That draft is then the subject of discussion between the proponent and my Department. At the conclusion of that process, the draft can be and usually is modified and then it is put out for public comment. In this case-I would have to check-I think it is three months. So in my view, the leaking of a preliminary draft before there is even a draft that goes to the public will not matter all that much. We are simply going through the very normal process of the proponent and its consultant talking to my Department prior to the publication of a document for public comment. So I do not regard it as being terribly serious. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `the Minister for Defence', who is not Mr Simmons. Mr Simmons did not make the decision to have an environmental impact statement (EIS) to examine whether Jervis Bay-full stop; not alternative sites, but Jervis Bay-would be an appropriate site for two distinct matters: firstly, moving an armament depot from the western suburbs of Sydney and, secondly, ultimately and many years in the future possibly moving the fleet. There are two distinct items. So in the first place it is not a matter of the Minister and his mate Mr Simmons-although the word `mate', I know, in the Labor Party can have many meanings-having a dispute. It is a matter concerning the Minister for Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the second place, I did not deal with the leaking of the draft environmental statement. I dealt with the leaking of letters from the Minister's Department to the Minister for Defence about the draft environmental impact statement. If, when the Minister's Department writes letters to another Minister relating to a matter on which no decision has been taken, it is now to be regarded as customary and acceptable that such letters should be made public, perhaps the Minister will do us the courtesy of tabling them in the Senate each day. It would save a lot of inconvenience. We could then see the nature of this war between him and the Minister for Defence. It would be out in the open. We would not have to wait until Four Corners published those letters-a copy of which I now have, by the way-on the television screens to demonstrate that there is a clear disagreement between the Minister and the Minister for Defence about, and this is the key point, whether it was appropriate for the Minister for Defence to limit the environmental impact statement to whether it was appropriate for Jervis Bay to be used or whether it should examine all possible alternatives on the east coast. That appears to be the burden of the disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister busily denies the existence of an internecine war between him and the Minister for Defence, let me remind him of what he agreed was basically correct in Senate Estimates committee hearings when I asked him whether he was properly quoted by Alderman Sue Hanley in regard to the Shoalhaven region. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson told us it was most unlikely the Navy could come up with an EIS which would satisfy the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Ultimately, the Minister's response was:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know its exact words but it was something along those lines, yes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Defence had asked that the EIS be done because his Department wanted to move there. However, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories admitted during Senate Estimates committee hearings that he had said to Alderman Sue Hanley that it was most unlikely that the Navy could come up with an EIS which would satisfy the Federal Government. According to this Minister's definition that does not involve any disagreement with the Minister for Defence. </PARA>

I do not know who has seen it; maybe one has to be on the special departmental leak list to get it. However, these letters have been leaked, aimed at damaging Minister Beazley's plans, firstly, to move the ammunition depot and, secondly, to see whether or not it is reasonable to move the Navy as a whole to Jervis Bay. They are the matters that are germane to the question I was asking. The Minister says that he does not propose to take action on the leaking of those letters. I ask him whether he regards as normal and acceptable that interdepartmental correspondence should be leaked to the media. Do we take the Minister's initial response that he does not propose to take any action to be some tacit acknowledgment that it is acceptable behaviour for his Department to seek to subvert the activities of other departments by leaking correspondence which is hostile to their objectives?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is absolutely no evidence that my Department did what Senator Baume claims-absolutely none. So, I do not have to deny anything, not a thing. Furthermore, Senator Michael Baume did not listen; so I will tell him again: I point out that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr David Simmons) is the Minister handling this, not the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). However, just for the record, Mr Beazley has been a friend of mine for just as long-and I am not at war with him, either. Clearly, as this process has gone on and on-and I might say that the environmental impact statement has taken a long time to get here-problems with the EIS have become apparent. The Prime Minister has mentioned this, and so have I, in public before. There is no great news about this. It is very old hat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say again that these leaks cannot be attributed to my Department without some evidence. Mind you, when it comes to the use of the smear, Senator Baume's record suggests that evidence is the last thing he ever cares about. Having said that, there are God knows how many people who have seen these letters, in the Department of Defence and in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories-not to mention people in the company that was doing the EIS in the first place. So, yes, there have been some problems with it, and I have referred to them. In no way does that mean that the Government has decided that it will not do it, but it does put on notice the Department of Defence and in particular those who are preparing the EIS that a great deal of care must be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is now generally acknowledged, and it should be acknowledged even by Senator Baume that Mr Simmons who has carriage of this matter in his portfolio did agree to my providing those letters. So, there has been no shock or horror about this; it has been a quite normal procedure. These letters form part of the normal process; that is, commenting on a draft before it is made public. The thing will be made public anyway in the space of the next few weeks. The letters that have been leaked are `FOI-able', and would have been in the public arena at some point, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders why there is such a huge outcry. Of course, it is only from Senator Baume. The community at large does not think that this is the hottest issue in town, and never will. In the remarks that I made last week at the launch of Professor Buckley's landmark study of environmental impact statements I stressed-because this is stressed by his work and the findings that he has published-that the best environmental impact statements and the ones that most effectively predict environmental consequences are those that result from processes which have involved public participation to a maximum extent. Over the next few months we will have a draft ready for public comment and for three months everyone will have a chance to look at the EIS and give their comments. That will be an important phase in this operation and it is one that I eagerly await. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for effectively confirming that the leaking of documents from his Department when there has been disagreement with another department is par for the course. Apparently it is considered that it is not the hottest game in town, it does not really matter, it is inconsequential, everyone can see it on television, so why bother about it, anyway. I note the Minister's response to the question of ministerial responsibility in his Department, and it does not surprise me; it is in keeping with his normal standards of behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now ask whether the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has any views on the Royal Australian Navy's case for removing the armaments depot from Newington. There was an impression in last night's Four Corners program that a view was held that there is no sound case for moving the ammunition depot, the armaments complex, from its present location in Sydney's western suburbs. No doubt the Minister is aware of the fact that the armaments depot at Newington involves a chain which does not meet North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) safety requirements. Some people say that that is not relevant. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sanders" NAMEID="1J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator Sanders</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true. It does meet NATO requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have an interjection that it does meet NATO requirements. I must say that I am much more inclined to take the advice that I have received that it does not. The present problem that we have with that armaments depot, as I understand it, is that its location on the Parramatta River, where it has been since 1881, poses real logistical and safety problems. There is another defence armaments depot at Kingswood, which is near Penrith. At present armaments are transported by road through Sydney between Kingswood and Newington and from Newington by barge via the Parramatta River to fleet units in Sydney Harbour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the proposed move of the armaments depot to the north-western part of Jervis Bay-and that is nowhere near the other proposed developments-went ahead, Newington would close and armaments would no longer travel between Kingswood, Newington and Sydney Harbour. The Navy has taken the view that, as Sydney has developed, it has become more difficult to meet appropriate safety standards for the storing and handling of armaments. The present system is also manpower intensive, time consuming and costly. Both the Federal and New South Wales governments are agreed that the Navy's ammunitioning process should be moved. Jervis Bay is the preferred new location. </PARA>
<PARA> We thus have a situation in which both governments have agreed that this ammunitioning process should be moved somewhere, with Jervis Bay being the preferred location. It is alleged that, because this ammunition is moved defused, it is therefore not a danger. Anyone who has seen ammunition depots attacked and the evidence of explosions in them would know that, when defused, there is still the prospect of explosions, given the right unfortunate circumstances. In any event, there is no doubt-and it is unarguable-that the burden of opinion, State and Federal, is that this depot should be moved. </PARA>
<PARA> Jervis Bay is a beautiful area, and I have spent at least one week every year holidaying there, particularly in the wilderness section. Therefore, I was intrigued by the footage chosen last night-and it was beautiful footage of Jervis Bay-for screening on the Four Corners program. I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that there are thousands of houses around Jervis Bay. The suburb of Vincentia is probably the fastest growing single community on the south coast of New South Wales, and it is located on the shores of Jervis Bay. Huskisson is a well known fishing holiday resort. Callala Beach, Callala Point, Callala Bay and Hyams Beach are all very well developed permanent and temporary holiday areas with a very large permanent population. </PARA>
<PARA> It just struck me as incredible that the integrity of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) is such that it was able to show not one house when photographing Jervis Bay. The impression it gave was that, in its entirety, it was as pristine as the beautiful sections of wilderness that exist in the area surrounding the present naval training station, HMAS Creswell, and certainly those areas where, if the fleet as a whole moved down, two kilometres of the total 65 kilometres of shore would be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not argue the merits or otherwise of the fleet moving there, because I do not have the vaguest idea about that. The proposed armaments depot is to the north-east on a degraded, burnt-out area of forest, and what I have seen of that makes it clearly a sensible, rational and useful choice as an area on which to place an armaments depot-certainly a far better place than the western suburbs of Sydney, where the depot is surrounded by millions of people as the armaments are brought to be loaded onto ships. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Navy has pointed out, an armaments complex well inland from the north-western side of Callala Beach and in State, not Commonwealth, territory would affect a degraded pine plantation inland from the bay. However, a jetty on the bay would be needed. With good planning, such a jetty would not affect the bay greatly or be very noticeable. It is possible that no dredging or breakwater construction will be necessary, and disturbance to sea grass and marine life can be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we heard none of that in last night's Four Corners program-not a skerrick of the Navy's position was mentioned. The ABC can be one-sided and dishonest if it wants to be. It can show not a house in the whole of Jervis Bay if it wants to, but I wonder what its point is. I wonder to what extent the ABC has been a convenient weapon of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) in this matter, deliberately setting out to damage the Navy's position. The Navy believes that the safety buffer zones required around the armaments complex will ensure that the environment is not disturbed and will actually help to protect native plants and animals. The depot site is remote from residential areas, public utilities and major road systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I suggested that perhaps it suited the Minister's book that the ABC took the course that it did on Four Corners is that that approach is in line with the continued attack of the Minister's Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories on the proposal. Whether or not the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) still has the carriage of it at present, the attack has continued-and this was the public arena element-on the proposal, even the armament area proposal. As I understand it, initially the Navy wanted there to be two entirely distinct and discrete environmental impact statements, one related to the movement of the fleet and the other specifically related to the ammunition proposal. That was admitted before Senate Estimates Committee D. I can tell the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that and save him the trouble of checking whether I am right; of course I am right. The Navy admitted that it should not have agreed to making it one lumpy 1,600-page-or whatever it is-environmental impact statement, but should have had separate statements. </PARA>
<PARA> I am wondering whether the Minister and his Department, as part of their campaign against this overall proposal, maintain a position against simply the ammunition proposal. As I have said, it would bring major benefits to the people of Sydney and would remove the chain of carriage of high explosive ammunition from the far west of Sydney through highly populated areas of Sydney, even though the ammunition is in a defused state. Does the Department lump this proposal in with its disdain for the rest of the Navy's proposal to move to Jervis Bay?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether the producers or journalists on the Four Corners program or I would be more insulted by the honourable senator's allegation that they were in some way a tool of mine. I think Andrew Olle would be having a coronary at this moment if he heard the allegation. I have already said that I did not speak to anyone connected with Four Corners about the program. There was no reason why I should have done so, and I did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will cover some of the points Senator Michael Baume has raised. He referred several times to the continued attack on the proposal by the Department and by me. There has not been any attack. My Department is exercising its responsibility to ensure the integrity of the environmental impact process. It does that by going to the consultant who has prepared the report on behalf of the proponent-in this case the Department of Defence-and saying, `This draft is inadequate in these ways. You will need to do more work on these sections'. Last night, one of the matters referred to by the Four Corners program was the question of the armaments depot. What my Department quite correctly said was that more work had to be done to justify the need for the move. There is nothing wrong with that. That is the Department fulfilling its statutory requirement. That is the Department doing its job. That is what it is there for. It performs that task on every single EIS, and that it would do so on this one is a matter about which I can only say I am happy. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding this ammunition wharf, I will not say that I agree with everything that Four Corners might or might not have said. I do not know what the program did say, because I did not see it. I was in this chamber answering questions from Senator Boswell and others when it was on. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Boswell" NAMEID="YE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator Boswell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very important questions, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I was in here; I was not out watching television, so I do not know what may or may not have been said. It has been suggested to me, and Senator Michael Baume has repeated it, that there was a suggestion in the program that large scale dredging might be necessary for the preferred option of a jetty into Jervis Bay and that breakwaters might need to be constructed. There is no question that the Royal Australian Navy has made it clear that that is not the case, and I acknowledge that. However, I did not ask Four Corners to say the opposite. If the program did, I hope it pays more attention to the cause of accuracy. Whether I make a recommendation for or against it, certainly one has to acknowledge the good work that has been done, and make sure that any inadequacies in that work are remedied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should also be noted that under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act proponents have to look at alternatives. The extent to which they do so can be debated, but feasible alternatives must be examined and it is the job of my Department to ensure that that is done. The idea of combining the two environmental impact statements was decided a long time ago-I think before I was the Minister. I do not believe I was responsible for it but, having said that, I do not regard it as an issue. No-one from Defence has at any time raised it with me and I do not think it is a source of continuing discussion between departments. Whether there are two environmental impact statements on the fleet base and the armaments depot or just the one makes precious little difference. It is a big issue, one that will not go away, and it needs public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is an argument to say that even defused ammunition should not be transported between these houses in Sydney, there is probably an argument from some residents around Jervis Bay to say they do not want it transported through there either. As to whether a jetty into the bay is an environmental problem, I suppose beauty, or the lack of it, is in the eye of the beholder. For all those who assert it does no environmental damage, I am sure there will be those who will assert that it will. The important thing is that I, and my Department, have not got a position on this. We will simply wait to see the final draft, what public comment does to that draft and what final document comes from that. At that point I will make a recommendation. I might say that that is all I do. I do not make the decisions around here; I just make recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally speaking, it is the Minister. Mr Temporary Chairman, I hope you will allow me the indulgence of answering that interjection, because it is reasonable. Normally it would be the responsibility of the Minister to make those decisions, and that is mostly what happens. On very big decisions the normal form is for the Minister to bring the matter to Cabinet. I imagine that a proposal such as this would be the subject of a Cabinet decision at the end of the day, but that would be up to the Minister to decide, and I have never asked that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that neither I nor my Department has a position. The only position we have at the moment is to observe our statutory duty to ensure that there is an environmental impact statement adequate to cope with the very serious environmental questions that are raised by either an armaments depot or a fleet base move to Jervis Bay, and adequate to ensure that all those who have a vital interest in this question can pick up a document and, at least, see the pros and cons of their argument traversed in that document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where Senator Michael Baume's argument was leading or what he was defending. I do not know whether his concern is for the safety of the people of Sydney or whether he wants to see that the Royal Australian Navy gets its way, but he made some statements which are false. The Newington depot conforms fully with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirements. If there is any difficulty, it is with the wharf and the man-o'-war anchorage which requires a public risk waiver to be issued. The Newington depot itself fully complies with NATO requirements. As Senator Richardson rightly points out, maybe it would cause the people of Sydney to be slightly less afraid of weapons if they did not come from Kingswood and go to Newington, but what about all the people along the several hundred kilometres from Kingswood to Jervis Bay? They would be put at risk on a very high risk road which, in fact, is the location of a number of accidents and these weapons would be subject to explosion if involved in an accident on the road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ammunition issue should be broader than simply whether the depot should be at Newington or Jervis Bay. The Navy itself has recognised the desirability of having ammunition stored further north along the coast. The port of Gladstone has offered itself both as a fleet base and as an ammunition depot, and this would be a likely alternative. The site need not be just either Jervis Bay or Newington. Perhaps the Navy should look at its operation in terms of neither, and move the ammunition depot further afield and avoid all these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The ammunition depot in Jervis Bay would be in two parts, which I did not feel was adequately spelt out. One of the parts will be in degraded forest, and the wharf could be located adjacent to a very fine rain forest area on the coast, and would degrade that. The whole area on that side of Beecroft Peninsula is of great Aboriginal significance, which is a further reason why the ammunition complex should not be put there. I did not quite follow the argument presented by Senator Michael Baume that somehow, as there was settlement at Vincentia and Huskisson, one is supposed to derive from that that it is okay for the ammunition depot or the Navy to go there. He seemed to be very upset that Four Corners did not show the settlements around Jervis Bay, but why should it? At issue were the naval developments which would change the whole aspect of Jervis Bay tremendously. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that I have explored these topics I would like to ask the Minister about his confidence in Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd. I have long been wary of Sinclair Knight and Partners. Ninety per cent of its business is in engineering and about 10 per cent in environmental impact statements. It has a built-in conflict of interest in its operations as Four Corners and documents issued before that program have pointed out. Is the Minister still confident in Sinclair Knight and Partners? Is he still using it as the primary source of the environmental impact statement (EIS) material? At the end of the day, will he continue to use Sinclair Knight and Partners or will he perhaps seek some other inputs to the EIS?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, it is a matter of looking at what process we are faced with. I do not hire and fire the consultants employed by departments or companies in relation to the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS); that is entirely a matter for them. It is my job and my Department's job to ensure the integrity of the process by very carefully monitoring what they are doing and ensuring that it is adequate. The only comment I make about Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd-I am not in the habit of making comments about companies doing EISs; I do not think it appropriate that I do so-is that any suggestion that their participation will guarantee them additional work is simply not true. They have no contractural right to more work. Any other work that they may seek, be it as environmental consultants or in their capacity as an engineering firm, would have to be won by competitive tender, or at the very least by following the normal processes laid down for government purchase of services. So I do not think that suggestion is true. I will not comment on the adequacy or otherwise of companies, but I will comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the impact statement itself.

The proposed site is inland and north-west of the bay and well removed from populated areas. If the Minister needs a map showing the location and its relationship with the populated areas, I am happy to provide him with one. The proposed ammunition depot is a long way away from any housing, apart from the odd farm on the road leading from the proposed depot to the proposed wharf. I mention that in passing because obviously the Minister did not know what he was talking about on that matter.

Very often it is too difficult to pursue trespassers. The crime of trespass is not yet a hanging offence. It might be if Senator Baume had his way, but it is not at this stage. I am not sure whether it is worth the Defence Force's while. I have never asked the Services whether that is the reason, but the advisers are nodding, so it looks as though I have picked it. Having said that, I do not approve of the actions of many people who trespass on the Beecroft range, including Australian Democrats senators who have done so. I have said a number of times in here that, no matter what arguments we have for the protection of some very special areas around Jervis Bay, I cannot accept that the Beecroft range is one such area. I cannot accept that it is environmentally sensitive and I definitely do not accept the argument that it is an area of Aboriginal heritage. Having looked over a very long period at the Jervis Bay sites identified, there is really not an argument over the Beecroft range. That was a piece of sensationalism by a number of people; as some of them are my friends, I will not name them. We must look at environmental issues with a clear, cool and sane head. That does not mean that every area is worth the big argument-only some. In the Jervis Bay area, Beecroft range certainly does not come into the category of an area about which environmentalists should be arguing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. As I was one of those who went out on the Beecroft range, I feel that perhaps I should explain our position. The point is that it is people's land; it is Aboriginal people's land and is significant to them. I went out on that range with an Aboriginal woman, a member of whose family had been killed in the early 1900s by an unexploded bomb, weapon or shell on the range. They grieve every time the shells hit that range. They suffer when the drum and drumsticks are hit by fire. The range is a remnant of a former time when the Royal Australian Navy had control over the area when HMAS Albatross was operating at full force. It is a kind of historic remnant that should not be there now. The whole area should be a national park. The undeveloped part of Jervis Bay should be a national park. I believe Senator Richardson is indicating in the negative and looking somewhat--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not quite hear what Senator Richardson said, but I do not think he agrees with my contention that it should be a national park. But it should be. The Navy has other areas that it can use for its shelling. It no longer needs that area to be contiguous to aircraft operations; there are other areas that it can shell. It is a unique area that should be preserved. The Navy has done a very good job and I give it full credit for stopping development in the Jervis Bay area. If the Navy had not had the control that it had, the place would be wall to wall condominiums. I give the Navy full credit for the job it has done in the past in preserving that area. But it is time for the Navy now to look at the greater good and say, `Yes, historically it was an accident that we had control of this area. We looked after it over those years but now, for the benefit of Australia, we will relinquish that control and give it over to national park status'. I mean a real national park-not one that will be subject to the whims of the New South Wales Government. But that is another issue. The point is that the Beecroft Peninsula is a very valuable area. It is worth saving in itself. Those who go out on the range to try to stop the bombardment do not do so just to be mischievous; they believe in their hearts that the bombardment should stop, and I too am of that opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief as I do not wish to debate the Beecroft range national park proposal at great length. Senator Sanders is someone who has fought for parks. An area has to be very special before I will go out and fight for it. It is true that the Royal Australian Navy has done a great job in maintaining Beecroft to the point that it is very often used for public recreational purposes, and I applaud that. National parks ought not to be those areas so modified by human behaviour. It is ludicrous to suggest that areas that have been bombed for 60 years are in some way pristine enough, good enough, to be national parks; they are just not. This is an area that is well looked after. I have no doubt that the Royal Australian Navy will continue to look after it well. I hope that it will continue to be used for recreational purposes, but that is not what national parks are about. What I am looking for as regards national parks, World Heritage areas and all the rest of it are those special parts of Australia that, hopefully, have not yet been greatly modified by human behaviour. If there is one form of human behaviour that modifies an area, it has to be bombing.</PARA></TALK.START>

All I can say is what I said the other day: whatever announcement is to be made, that announcement will come at the end of a proper tendering process which has to take into account all the technical and contractual considerations as well as the competitive prices. This was an open tender and, as with all open tenders, it will be decided on merits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to follow up the matter raised in Senate Estimates Committee D of the A4 aircraft that are being leased back by the Australian Government from the New Zealand Government in order to provide fleet support work. As the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is aware, these aircraft were sold by the Australian Labor Government, obviously very foolishly and recklessly, to New Zealand at a give-away price. We now have to hire them back in order to provide fleet support work for the Royal Australian Navy. They will be stationed at HMAS Albatross where they were originally stationed before this Government so damagingly depleted our resources by selling these excellent aircraft, which are not only first rate for fleet training, but also probably the best ground support aircraft still in general service.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. When he eventually gets the information and reveals it to us he might mention to us which of the aircraft are continuing New Zealand aircraft and which are Australian aircraft that have come back under different colours. My understanding is-I think the Minister's answer obfuscates this-that the great bulk of these aircraft came from Australia. In any event, as I understand it, they are to be rotated during the contract. The rotation arrangement under which New Zealand will be providing a service to Australia will mean that at some stage those aircraft sold to New Zealand which are serviceable, which have not crashed or been severely dealt with by the New Zealand pilots, will at some stage come back to provide this service. Sure, they will be supplemented by some A4s that the New Zealand Air Force already had, but I do not think the Minister's answer, which seeks to obfuscate the position, denies the fundamental point that the aircraft that will at some stage be servicing these requirements are aircraft we sold, very foolishly, to New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot say what the `formula' was in that sense, because I am not sure whether I have an exhaustive list, but, as I think I outlined in this chamber some time ago, the airlines are providing some of the costs, such as fuel and ground handling costs, but were not recovering costs which in any case would have been borne by the Defence Department: capital costs, salaries, et cetera-that is, one would imagine, the more normal element of this. They are recovering an element of costs for spares and maintenance. I cannot yet say whether that recovery will be the total cost; that is yet to be determined. But I have said here before, and I think the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has said, that the Department of Defence, if necessary, will be looking at a supplementation in its estimates later to make up the shortfall.</PARA></TALK.START>

Having said that, once the problem begins it is the job of government to look at how it can solve it. In doing so, at the very beginning of the dispute, the Minister quite correctly identified the defence forces as one means of easing public hardship and very quickly told the Chief of the Defence Force of his views on that. Subsequent to his laying down those views, there were consultations and negotiations with a whole range of people; and eventually Cabinet made a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of this chamber the very real concerns that I have on this matter, which I believe are evident from the line of questioning that I have been following today. The chamber should be aware that the Defence Instructions (General) require-they have the force of law-the Defence Force to follow certain procedures in the use of defence assets in assisting the civil community. They lay down that the Defence Force must either get full cost recovery or fulfil the requirements for waiving it. In this case the Defence Force did neither; therefore, I believe that the charges levied on the airlines, despite this document, which does not cut across that at all, are invalid and will have to be replaced and the airlines will have to reimburse the Defence Force for the full cost of the charters. I just put on the record that I have taken this matter to the Auditor-General and asked him to investigate. He has given me a verbal assurance that he will do so. It is in the light of that that I ask that all the documents relating to the Minister's directions to the forces be tabled in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave an indication some time ago about seeking the Minister's advice on the tabling of other documents. That was an extraordinary performance by Senator Newman. There is no question in anyone's mind, including hers, that the Minister for Defence and the Government can issue instructions to the Department of Defence-to the forces. Of course, that is what was done on this occasion. There is absolutely no doubt about that whatsoever. If the Minister wanted to make another instruction about this tomorrow afternoon, he could do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Irrespective of the Defence Instructions (General), to which the honourable senator was referring earlier, there is no doubt about the legal and constitutional capacity of the Minister for Defence to issue instructions. On this occasion the Minister issued an instruction; negotiations took place afterwards over quite a protracted number of weeks; there were Cabinet discussions and eventually a Cabinet decision; there were meetings between departments and between Ministers-all of which is the absolutely normal process of government going on at an abnormal time, when an extraordinary situation had developed because one group of pilots decided to hold our economy to ransom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go back to the matter that Senator Newman was dealing with before the suspension of the sitting for dinner-namely, the actual amount by which the taxpayer is subsidising the airlines for each hour that the airlines use a government aircraft. In the replies to questions taken on notice, the Government advised us that under the agreement with the airlines, Defence is recovering an assessed amount per hour flown for spare parts and contractor maintenance but not for fixed costs such as salary costs, capital amortisation or overheads. The airlines are directly responsible for the provision of fuel, accommodation, meals and transfer costs for Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircrew and maintenance staff, ground handling, aircraft cleaning, in-flight rations and other minor miscellaneous expenditure. We were also told that the cost recovery rates per flying hour for spare parts and contractor maintenance-that is the total amount, apparently, to be claimed-for a 707 was $1,500 an hour. It was then stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The reason this is very relevant is that Senator Newman was told, in response to question on notice No. 103 in which she asked for the hourly cost of a 707 to the Air Force, that the full running cost per hour is $12,031 as against a recovery rate of $1,500 an hour. It is true that not all of those costs would be capable of being recovered because the Air Force costs include petrol, oils and lubricants amounting to $1,983 an hour. Those costs are being paid for by the airlines themselves; they are providing the fuels, as I understand it. The airlines are directly responsible for the provision of fuel, among other minor items. So of that $12,031 we can take out petrol, oils and lubricants. We still have a figure of about $10,000 an hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It interests me to know how many other costs can be deducted from the $10,000 an hour. The cost to the Air Force of replacement spares when running these aircraft is assessed at $2,191 an hour, whereas the allowance for spare parts and contractor maintenance is set at only $1,500 an hour to the airlines. It would be rational if increased usage brought about a diminution in the hourly cost. Obviously, the longer an aircraft is used the less will be the impact on costs per hour. If that $2,191 an hour in replacement spares comes out instead at $1,500, we are still left with a contractor servicing cost of $2,953 an hour. If, in fact, the $1,500 an hour that the airlines are being charged is supposed to represent a combination of replacement spares and contractor servicing, which totals something like $5,000 an hour, I find it absolutely extraordinary that the economies of scale involved in greater usage because of the airline strike have, if you like, reduced the replacement spares and contractor servicing costs by something greater than one-third. It is simply untrue, I would think, that that would be the volume of the reduced incidence of costs per hour. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying all these things to outline the need for the Government to come clean on these figures. Massive amounts of money per hour are involved. Look at the salary related costs: in-house maintenance costs amount to $851 an hour; crew costs amount to $888 an hour; salary related departmental administrative on-costs-and Senator Newman might be fascinated by this item-amount to $1,323. In other words, the salary related departmental administrative on-costs are 50 per cent more than the crew costs. This seems, once again, to reinforce the point that has been made by Senator Newman that it costs much more to administer an army than to have an army. It costs much more in administrative on-costs back at Russell Hill or somewhere than it costs actually to pay the crew. Maybe there is an explanation for this that will reveal all. Then, non-salary related departmental administrative on-costs amount to $883 an hour. We have something like over $2,200 an hour on various departmental administrative on-costs-one salary, one non-salary. On top of that, we have $959 in capital costs per hour. Allowing for economies of scale on some of the other items, it is evident that the Air Force is picking up a bill probably of about $8,000 an hour. The Air Force is still picking up about $8,000 an hour for the hours during which the aircraft are being used by the airlines. As well, the Government is being paid $1,500 an hour. So, every hour these Air Force planes are in the air, there is a loss per hour of about $8,000. That is the sort of cost that Senator Newman was talking about. It is the cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that Senator Richardson realised that when he talks about the cost to the Australian public of the airlines dispute basically he is talking about the cost to a relatively small proportion of the Australian public who are consistent users of airlines and who have been massively inconvenienced by the arrogant activity of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, equally matched by the arrogant behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It takes two to tango. In this matter, the Prime Minister has behaved with no less arrogance than the Federation of Air Pilots or, it seems, the employers. It is only right, now that these figures have been revealed, for the Government and the Minister to indicate whether it is correct that the defence forces have to directly subsidise the airline companies by about $8,000 an hour when they use a 707. When does the Government intend to work out what the cost to the Australian Defence Force has been? As I understand it, the timetable is for these aircraft to be withdrawn by Christmas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I explained to Senator Newman earlier, all of these costs are fixed costs which we would have been paying anyway. So we do not regard that as a problem. The main point Senator Baume is missing out on is that these costs are predicated on the basis of a normal year for a 707 in our service. That normally works out at 250 hours a year. That is what the costs are based on. In the space of just two months, to the middle of this month, they have flown 540 hours, which is an extraordinary difference and which must have a substantial bearing on the costs which have been supplied to Senator Baume as a result of the question on notice. So when one takes into account that quite massive operational difference, it must have a proportionate effect on the costs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I addressed a question to the Minister. I mentioned that the Defence Department contract for the maintenance of the Hercules fleet of aircraft in Australia had gone to New Zealand. The Minister informed me that the contract had not been let. I then asked the Minister whether any person in the Australian companies that tendered for that contract had been advised that the contract had been awarded to New Zealand. The Minister responded that no-one had been so advised. I found that strange, and I contacted people in the Hawker Pacific aviation company. They sent me a press release which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In response to verbal advice from the Department of Defence that a contract for maintenance of RAAF C130s Hercules aircraft is to be placed with Air New Zealand Hawker de Havilland. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister is playing semantics and saying that the contract has not been let but that it has informed Hawker de Havilland that it will not get the contract, that it has been awarded to New Zealand, then the Minister is misleading the Committee. Hawker de Havilland would not have put out this press release unless it had been informed by the Department of Defence that that contract had gone to a company outside Australia. I point out the seriousness of this matter to the Minister. I note that he has not intentionally misled the Senate but obviously he has got the wrong advice. I note that the Minister has asked his adviser, who is checking. We might be able to leave the matter until that advice is received. </PARA>

No contract has been let until the Minister has approved and announced it. I am advised that he has not. So I cannot play with words over that. Secondly, I rechecked with the adviser who was here regarding the question of whether anyone in the industry was advised that a contract was about to be let to a New Zealand outfit. He repeated that in so far as he was aware, no. But he has gone to check with the officer who gave the actual advice at the time that Senator Boswell asked the question before dinner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to another matter. A point is made in the Estimates Committee D report to the Senate that members of the Committee directed a significant number of questions on matters of fact to the Department in advance of the hearing and that the Department took a large number of further questions on notice at the hearing. The report made the following point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While recognising the workload associated with answering these questions, the Committee considered the Department should be capable of more rapid response. Most, if not all, of the questions related to matters of fact and the requirement of a department to answer such questions from Estimates committees is a predictable feature of the Public Service routine. The Committee expects prompt and full answers to the questions of fact that its members direct to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>One question which I asked, and which prompted a response that was wrong-surprisingly, especially as the response came from the Minister-was whether the services are acting as agents for the airlines in their activities. I wanted to know whether any negligence involved in any accidents, for example, would involve a claim on them by a passenger. Senator Richardson responded:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that all I can say in answer to Senator Baume-and obviously I would have to have this checked with some superior legal advice to mine-is that I would imagine that anyone flying on Air Force planes at the moment is contracting not with the Air Force but with the airlines through which they booked the ticket. I would imagine that any action they would have for some injury that might befall them would be against the airline. But we would have to check that. </PARA>
<PARA>The thing that interested me was that at the Estimates Committee hearing it was asserted that it was not known, that that advice had not been looked into at the time the deal was done with the airlines about providing aircraft. Yet the written response that I get is that the established legal position was confirmed prior to setting up the arrangements for Defence Force assistance to the airlines. It does not say by whom it was confirmed. Perhaps the defence forces were not aware that it had been confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> The following response was provided to a question asked in the Senate Estimates Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>Claims by passengers or their dependants arising from injury or death in the course of carriage by Defence Force aircraft are covered by the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963. The general effect of that Act, which applies the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act 1959 to such carriage, is that the Commonwealth is liable as operator of the aircraft without proof of negligence but subject to a statutory upper limit of $100,000 for the claims in respect of each casualty. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commonwealth has been accepting a very large insurance risk, if you like, over the many thousands of people it has been carrying in defence service aircraft. That intrigues me, because I would have imagined that the private carriers would be paying insurance premiums to cover such insurance risk. Here is another hidden cost that the private carriers have been relieved of by this generous Government-I suppose, in the circumstances, I could say, `From a great height', as they are up in the air. It disturbs me that here we have another instance of a hidden subsidy. I do not know what the size of the subsidy is, because I presume that the Commonwealth does not insure for these kinds of risks. That is the normal style. I ask the Minister whether, in view of the special risk being undertaken, special private insurance was taken out and, if so, whether the airlines were charged with this cost that they would otherwise have to face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The airlines did not take out separate insurance and were not charged for our costs, given, of course, that our costs do not exist. I do not think we actually carry a policy on this. Given that there is a limited liability of $100,000, the Commonwealth simply agreed to carry it. I did say in answer to a question at the time that that is what I imagined and that I would have it checked, et cetera. As it turns out, the legal position of the Commonwealth being liable as the operator with an upper limit of $100,000 was established prior to setting up the arrangements with the Defence Force to assist the airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I understand his acknowledgment that, by the Government accepting this risk, it was relieving the airlines of yet another cost. I do not know the size of it, but it is another of those hidden costs that the Government has relieved the airlines of. It has taken on a very considerable risk. The $100,000 referred to by the Minister is per passenger, when planes such as the 707s take well over 100 passengers. The potential cost and the risk taken by the Government is very substantial. No doubt, the cost that would have fallen on the private operators had they had to insure against that cost would have been considerable. It is just another example of Government largesse to its mates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to ask a brief question on another matter. From the answer to a question from Senator MacGibbon which was taken on notice, the failure rate of engines in the patrol boats appears to be substantial. In fact, it appears to be remarkable. I think the reply to his question is that five engines have been totally replaced since 1988. Is this the normal failure rate of engines? What is the reason for the failure? What action has been taken to recover costs? What problems have emerged from any inquiry that has taken place? Is there an anticipated further failure rate in patrol boat engines?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problems in the engines to which the honourable senator refers were not related to any one fault. The record of these engines up until the time of the failures had been good, and I understand that it has been good since. For some reason we had four unrelated and different failures in a short period. The engines are out of warranty, so there is no action that the Commonwealth can take to recover any costs of repairs or parts. Given that the performance of these engines has apparently been pretty good since, we have no reason to expect any further failure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now want to deal very briefly with responses to questions that both Senator Newman and I asked during the Estimates hearings about the rights of the Minister to alter the arrangements under which aircraft were provided for carrying passengers in aid of a civilian situation. I asked in particular, whether there were any limits on the powers of the Minister to make orders relating to the defence forces being used for non-defence purposes. The question I asked was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the limits to instructions that can be issued by the Minister for the ADF?</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, the simple response was that there are not any, except those set by the Constitution. I must say that this struck me as being of concern. The reply says:</PARA>
<PARA>1. a. Section 8 of the Defence Act (consistently with established constitutional practice) vests the general control and administration of the Defence Force in the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA> b. Command of the Defence Force and the arms of the Defence Force under s 9 of the Defence Act is exercised subject to and in accordance with any directions of the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>I accent that-`any directions of the Minister'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> c. Section 9a of the Defence Act empowers the Secretary of the Department and the Chief of the Defence Force to jointly have the administration of the Defence Force, subject to the powers of the Minister in s 8. </PARA>
<PARA>2. On the question of whether there are limits to the instructions the Minister can give, the Minister can give instructions in relation to the control and administration of the Defence Force which are within the powers of the Executive Government under the Constitution. Accordingly, the Minister for Defence can provide directions for the exercise of the command and administrative powers over the Australian Defence Force provided those directions are themselves in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth. In practice, additional constraints on the powers of the Minister for Defence would include the policies of the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit of a whimsy; this Government's policies do not appear to rest heavily on the precept that strike breaking and the use of the defence forces to break strikes is part of its policies, but that is for the Government to determine. Apparently, that provision imposed no constraint on this Government. The reply continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . of which he is a member, the conventions of the Cabinet system and his accountability to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>A Minister's accountability to parliament is all very well if Parliament knows what he has done. Parliament has not been able to find out what the Minister for Defence has done. We have had to ask inch by inch and batter our way through a wall of silence to find out what has been done. If the Department is going to provide us with answers saying that the accountability of the Minister is one of the very few constraints on a Minister's activities, and this Government does not tell us what is happening, then I believe we are in a very serious constitutional position. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman has only recently received a letter that states that the Minister had said he wanted full cost recovery. I think that was in August. He is the Minister. With the Government apparently taking a different view, we do not find out specifically what directions have been given. In response to a question I asked about 10 minutes ago, we were told by the Minister, `We cannot let you know that; a freedom of information request is in. We do not know whether we can let you know exactly what the instructions are, as we have not made up our minds about it'. It seems to me that this is a serious matter of basic principle. If the basis on which the Minister is at all limited in the exercise of his power to do anything or to issue any directions and his accountability to the Parliament is one of the constraints, then this Government has just totally shown its contempt for the Parliament by not providing this kind of detail. </PARA>
<PARA> In that sort of context the sorts of concerns expressed by Air Vice-Marshal Collings, retired, about the unlimited capacity of the Government to instruct the Defence Force to do anything, despite the Defence Force's regulations, and to ignore or overrule those regulations, seem to me to be very real. Following my questions of Admiral Beaumont before Estimates Committee D, Air Vice-Marshal Collings wrote to me, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, there is a basic contradiction in Adm Beaumont's reply: he starts by saying that the relevant Defence instructions are `simply self-imposed instructions within the Department of Defence.' He then concludes by saying that `the instructions to which the Air Vice Marshal was referring were, in fact, derived through the authority and power of the Minister, and not by any other means.' You will note that in my letter I specifically said that the Instructions are issued on the authority of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>He therefore takes exception to the admiral's statement that he, Air Vice-Marshal Collings, was not aware of the origin of these departmental instructions. The key point in the letter is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The first argument was that the Minister could override or vary the requirements of the Defence Instructions as the instructions are self-imposed administrative rules. I have no argument with the first part of this statement but of course in such a serious matter as the pilot's dispute, one would expect that the Minister's accountability to the public would require a public statement on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if it is a special case then the public deserves to know why the actions by the Minister go against the general caution in the instructions with respect to use of the ADF in industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt in my mind that what happened went against the general instructions because of the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with this strike and his determination to break the union for whatever purpose he had. I must say that I agree with what Air Vice-Marshal Collings says in another letter, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We seem to have a situation where expert opinion in this country thinks that because the use of the ADF in this dispute is popular with a large section of the public then the consequences are unimportant, where this is far from the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any official statements on the matter I must assume certain facts. Firstly, the dispute is not considered a national emergency or the ADF would have been `called out' by an order of the Governor-General-in-Council. One would certainly expect to have been appraised publicly of such a serious action by the Government-wouldn't one? The use of the ADF must therefore be on the basis of assistance of a non-emergency nature to the civil community. . . If that is so, then the full cost of the operation should have been recovered or the public purse would have been used to unfairly advantage one section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that all these issues have been raised before. All I want to say is that the action taken by the Government imposes on it a special requirement to come clean, and this Government has failed to do so; it has ducked it. The only information is information that has been teased and weaselled out of it. We are still waiting for the terms of the deal. We are still waiting to find out why this Government has broken the ADF's own rules. I believe that this is a matter of major principle, and it would be very nice if the Government could at last come clean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this afternoon, when replying to Senator Newman, I covered the question of instructions to the Australian Defence Force and the power of a Minister. I find it extraordinary that we have to look at a call-out by the Governor-General in this respect. After all, we are not asking the Air Force to strafe the Hurstville headquarters of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. We are not asking it to use force or bear arms against the Australian people. We were asking it, in the event of this extraordinary action by the pilots, to perform a public service. The power of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) over the defence forces has surely never been in question and, if he has the power to make regulations, he has the power to change them. Quite clearly, the Minister, and indeed the Government, decided what the defence forces ought to do and instructed them accordingly. They have acted accordingly, all quite properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This suggestion that the Government has failed to come clean is really incredible. The reality is that day after day for months the Government has been subjected to matters of public importance, censure motions and questions. This has gone on for all this time and the Government, as always for this Government, has quite properly responded because it has had nothing to hide. We have provided to Senator Newman, over the last few hours, quite a number of documents that outline Government decision making on this matter. I would have thought that there has never been a government in this country as prepared to make available information as is this one, and the way in which we have done so on this occasion is exemplary for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To hear this Minister in this Government-which has done its utmost to keep from the public view what the facts of the subsidies are; the hidden subsidies; and the hidden deals-say that the Government has nothing to hide is extraordinarily at odds with the fact that the only basic information we have got is what has been teased out of this Government because of the energy of, and continued attacks by, people like Senator Newman at Senate Estimates committees or in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been embarrassed into a position where it has had to release that sort of information. It has not released any piece of information of substance willingly, without having been nagged or cornered. It has not released the deal that it did with the airlines yet. It has not released how much it is costing the Royal Australian Air Force per hour under these new arrangements with these new depreciation rate hours. In other words, we have no idea what the benefits have been to the two major private sector operators. Any information we have got has come over the dead bodies of this Minister and this Government. If the Government has nothing to hide, it has behaved in an incredible way by not releasing information until it is forced into it, and we have still to see a lot more. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion on this particular matter, I point out that the report of Estimates Committee D, which was agreed to by both the Government and Opposition members, said this in relation to the Defence Instructions (General) (DI(G)):</PARA>
<PARA>It would be unfortunate if any ministerial direction so to use the ADF was to weaken unintentionally-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know about unintentionally-</PARA>
<PARA>the protections built into the DI(G). </PARA>
<PARA>The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee accepts that the Government has the power, subject to the law, to determine the circumstances and conditions under which the ADF is used to assist the civil community. This power clearly extends to varying conditions specified in the DI(G). However, it can be presumed that DI(G) were drafted so as to protect the interests of the Commonwealth while permitting appropriate use of the ADF in assistance to the civil community. </PARA>
<PARA>As we have noted, DI(G) were varied, and they were overruled. The Minister changed them-the Minister of the Government which has nothing to hide on this matter. I think his response is pathetic. </PARA>

The decision will be made and announced by the Minister. He has not made that decision and he has not announced it. Until he does, any advice, verbal or otherwise, from the Department of Defence, the Royal Australian Air Force or anyone else for that matter has no authority at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -We find ourselves in an extraordinary position, as I think the Minister would agree, where, in a press release, Hawker de Havilland Ltd says it has been advised verbally that it has lost the contract, and we have advice from the Minister that he has issued no instructions. I suppose we will have to leave it to everyone to draw their own conclusions as to what really did happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am grateful that this contract has not been let to New Zealand, perhaps the Government may have had a deathbed repentance and seen the error of its ways in awarding a $20m contract to New Zealand, as this press release states. I will be delighted if this is the case, but I hope false expectations will not be built up in Hawker de Havilland in north Queensland, which expected to get the contract and has got the facilities to service these planes, because it has been advised that the contract is going to New Zealand. That story has been carried in the press. If Hawker de Havilland in north Queensland was told that the contract had not been let and that there was a chance that north Queensland, or any other Hawker de Havilland facility, would be awarded this $20m contract, and then the Government was inconsiderate enough to award the contract to New Zealand, the Minister would be in a very embarrassing position. </PARA>
<PARA> Every day there is a matter of public importance raised or a question asked making the Government aware of Australia's balance of payments difficulties. Awarding a $20m contract offshore for our own defence facilities will certainly not help our defence industry or our balance of payments problems. I cannot ask the Minister about the commercial considerations relating to each tender submitted because, if the Minister is as good as his word, the contract has not been awarded. However, I ask the Minister to advise the Minister for Defence that there are special considerations which have to be gone into before this contract goes offshore. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, has the Department of Defence received United States of America State Department approval to have US manufacturers' defence equipment maintained in a country which does not have strong defence relationships with the US? That is a question for Mr Beazley to consider before he gives this contract out, and before it goes overseas. How can a contract involving the economy, security and defence work be given out overseas? These considerations must be observed. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister has just got the contract on hold to be awarded at a later date-after this Saturday or some time like that-then the Minister will be in a very embarrassing position. I ask the Minister to take on board the message that I have given to him. If the $20m contract for our C130 Hercules has not gone to New Zealand, then he should use all the persuasive power that he can, and all the pressure that he can mount on his colleague Mr Beazley to make sure that that contract for Australian defence equipment is allowed to be pursued by Australian workers to provide jobs for Australian workers and to improve Australia's balance of payments figures by saving a $20m bill being paid to the firm in New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA> As to the remarks Senator Boswell made about New Zealand, and about the $20m, the balance of payments, et cetera, I can only say that it was the Fraser Government that negotiated the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand which calls upon us to treat New Zealand as our own in these matters. While I cannot give any information as to the possible reaction of the United States if we were to award the contract to New Zealand, one wonders how much the United States could object, given that New Zealand currently maintains for the United States the C130 that services the Antarctic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter relating to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) Act arrangements for service personnel. I refer specifically to a letter that I have received from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) in response to representations that I made to him. I will do so without referring to the former serviceman's name because that is not specifically relevant. I want to know whether this is a situation that arises frequently. In his letter the Minister refers to my representations and goes on to point out that any member who re-enters the Defence Force has the opportunity to elect to repurchase into the scheme for his or her past service, the cost being generally 5.5 per cent of the salary on re-entry for each year of service purchased. He goes on to comment about the arrangements for payment back and says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Such purchase enhances the benefit on age retirement and allows for the payment of pension on retirement with less than 20 years current service. </PARA>
<PARA> All members who purchase past service have the potential to benefit from that action and it is for that reason that the DFRDB Act requires that payment be completed in all cases and any amount outstanding on discharge becomes a debt to the Commonwealth and must be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the point that I wish to raise. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Those who are classified Class B who are discharged with less than 23 years of service on Class A are in this category. </PARA>
<PARA>He says that they do not gain any advantage from this and then says:</PARA>
<PARA>However neither the member nor his service could foresee the invalidity discharge. The member presumably took such a possibility into account before electing to purchase his past service. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me to be patently absurd to suggest that anyone who had been in the Services but left and then went back would be doing so foreseeing the possibility of invalidity. He then goes on to deal with the facts of the case in particular, which I will present to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), who is at the table, so that he will understand precisely what I am talking about. He says that this man served from 12 April 1966 to 11 April 1972 and re-entered on 17 February 1981. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>He elected on 20 July 1981 to purchase his six years past service. He was paying this off at $15.70 per fortnight. He had paid some $1789 by the time he was discharged on invalidity grounds on 28 February 1986. A further $3328 was outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he is being pursued for that now that he has left the service. This is not quite in the same category as the $20m that the Minister was talking about a short while ago, but it is very big money to my constituent. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was originally classified as Class C, which entitled him to a refund of his contributions, including the amount he paid for his past service. In addition, he was entitled to an additional payment equal to half his total contributions. This additional payment included an amount equal to half the payment still owing for the purchase of his past service. There was no point in requiring him to make payment of the outstanding debt at that time as it would have been immediately refunded to him. Mr . . . received full recognition of his past service in Class C benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr . . . sought reconsideration of the Class C decision and on 21 November 1988 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal set aside the decision and classified him as Class B from the date of discharge. As a result of that decision Mr . . . receives a Class B pension. The Class C benefit already paid was recovered from the arrears of pension due to him. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that Mr . . . was discharged on invalidity grounds-</PARA>
<PARA>that is an understatement; it is unfortunate-</PARA>
<PARA>and classified at a level where he did not benefit from his earlier decision to purchase his past service. </PARA>
<PARA>How the Act could be worded in such a way as to potentially penalise any serviceman in that fashion is beyond me. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless I confirm that Mr . . . is required to pay the amount outstanding at his discharge to finalise the purchase of his past service. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to give what the Authority considers is the appropriate rate of payment at which he may pay, et cetera, and says that if he feels a lower rate of recovery is appropriate he should speak to the Authority. The Minister concludes in the last paragraph by saying that he trusts that this has clarified the matter for my constituent. I can tell the Committee that it did not clarify it for my constituent and it certainly did not clarify it for me. I cannot believe that the Minister, knowing that the Act penalises servicemen in this fashion, does not do something about it. Knowing that, I cannot believe that he does not take the appropriate step to make an ex gratia payment to expunge the debt when he says in his letter that clearly the officer has received no benefit from it. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent received a letter dated 22 December 1988 setting out his entitlements as a consequence of his discharge and indicating the rate of fortnightly repayment thereafter. There was no mention whatever of paying any money back to him. Subsequently, in March, to my constituent's astonishment, he got a letter saying, `It has come to our attention that at the time of your discharge you were purchasing previous service under section 89 of the Act'. It went on to give the total cost of the purchase, stated that he had paid so much and still owes $3,000-odd. It then stated, `As this amount represents a debt due and payable to the Commonwealth, I have no alternative but to request that your remittance for the above amount be forwarded'. There was absolutely no explanation in this letter as to how this came about. I am sure honourable senators can imagine how somebody would feel on receiving such a letter. I suggest that the letter could have been worded much better. He could at least have been invited in to have explained to him what had happened and why the money was owing, if it is possible to give an explanation of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister implies in his letter that this happens quite frequently. I would like to know whether it does happen frequently and how many people have been affected by this and have had to pay back what are considerable amounts of money long after they have been discharged and thought they were getting on with their lives in a different fashion having had to leave the Services on the ground of invalidity. How many current cases are there? Why does the Minister not seek the authority either to amend the Act or at least to give him some discretion as to whether he persecutes servicemen in this fashion or gives them some chance to get on with their lives?</PARA>

We seem to have got to a situation where the Minister, Mr Beazley, was clearly aware of the Defence Instructions (General) on aid to the civil community. He issued an instruction on 23 August to the Department of Defence for the use of the RAAF aircraft, in which he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Prime Minister intends that the airlines should retain responsibility for ticketing and seat-allocation, and that the Commonwealth would recover from the airlines the full costs of operating these services. </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, there seems to be no conflict there as far as I am concerned. The Minister understood about the DI (G). He issued an instruction to the Defence Force which was not in conflict in any way with the DI (G) and, therefore, both were operating side by side in a legal sense. So far there is no problem. However, we now find that there has not been full cost recovery and we turn, therefore, to the document signed by Mr Hugh White, a Senior Private Secretary to Mr Beazley, dated 28 August, as I have already said, in which he refers to his telephone advice of 24 August to the Department. I remind the Committee that that was one day after the Minister's direction to the Department for full cost recovery. Mr White stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to confirm my telephone advice of 24 August 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, one day after the Minister's determination-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Prime Minister has agreed-</PARA>
<PARA>not `the Cabinet has agreed', mind you-</PARA>
<PARA>to a schedule of maintenance charges for RAAF aircraft chartered to the airlines during the current dispute as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>B707</PARA>
<PARA>$1500</PARA>
<PARA>HS748</PARA>
<PARA>$800C130</PARA>
<PARA>$970</PARA>
<PARA> I would be grateful if you would arrange for the airlines to be advised of these charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also be grateful if you could prepare for the Minister's signature a letter to the Prime Minister and a copy to Senator Walsh, asking that Defence receive supplementation to its budget to cover the difference between these charges and RAAF operating expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>Could I now be told whether the Senior Private Secretary to the Minister for Defence is correct when he said in his minute of 28 August, `The Prime Minister has agreed to a schedule of maintenance charges'? Should that read, `The Cabinet has agreed to a schedule of maintenance charges.'? I remind the Minister that before the suspension of the sitting for dinner he told the Committee that the Cabinet had decided on this matter. </PARA>

Perhaps the Minister could now tell me why there has been no full cost recovery. I have asked him that before and he has given me the answer that the public benefits. The public is benefiting by the provision of planes and seats on aeroplanes. Why was there no full cost recovery from the airlines which are charging full economy fares, not having to pay landing and navigation charges on this, and getting an airline dirt cheap, courtesy of the Australian taxpayer?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise that the Australian people have suffered a fantastic amount of benefit through the excellent service provided by the defence forces during the airline dispute. As a Tasmanian, I recognise that especially because we have had virtually nothing but Defence Force aircraft into Launceston from the middle of August this year until about a week ago. Nobody would know better than I the benefit of having the Defence Force. That is not the question at issue. The question at issue is why the airlines, which have been getting so many benefits from the taxpayer during this dispute, should be getting the benefit of no full cost recovery from the defence forces so that the Defence budget is in jeopardy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, the letter of 5 September from the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) reveals his concern as to how he will be left financially with his budget. Not only will the Defence budget be in jeopardy but clearly the citizens who are flying in trying conditions-if they can get a seat at all-are also being asked to pay for the privilege of the airlines having a cheap run. The Minister is chortling away on the front bench opposite but he is not prepared to explain to the Committee the justification for the lack of full cost recovery in the use of our Defence Force aircraft. His silence is a condemnation of his Government's action in the whole matter. He and his Government stand condemned for this, as they do for so many other aspects of the airline dispute. The people of Australia will be the judge of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Committee's attention to the letter which Mr Beazley sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 5 September and in which he spelled out the problems related to the hourly costs of the aircraft. He also drew attention to another matter which has not been raised on the public record; that is, that the RAAF has had to cancel a number of its own scheduled services because its aircraft are under charter to the airlines. Consequently, Defence has been required to pay fares to the airlines for Defence personnel to travel on chartered RAAF aircraft. He said that the cost involved was being captured and will not be finalised until the dispute is over. Mr Beazley spells out in his letter of 5 September his concern that he had already advised the Prime Minister as to the adequacy of these charges being made to the airlines. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In advising you on the schedule of charges, I pointed out . . . the adequacy of these charges to cover RAAF's actual maintenance expenses could not be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to point out that the RAAF was in the position of having to pay fares for its personnel to travel in these RAAF chartered aircraft because they did not have enough aircraft available to use for its normal purposes. He pointed out also the effect that that cost was having on the Defence budget and that he wanted confirmation of the agreement to supplement for the shortfall in actual maintenance costs which would not be recoverable from the airlines and any other additional operating costs incurred as a result of the RAAF aircraft not being available for normal operations. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have a copy of the Prime Minister's response. From the way in which this Minister has had to have teeth drawn out of him today and previously in the Estimates committee hearings, I presume that he will not produce the Prime Minister's acknowledgment that he will meet these costs. He probably will not because he probably will not be in government when the April Estimates committee hearings come around. Goodness knows what a mess we will have to clean up when we try to deal with this, as in so many other parts of the economy that the Government has ruined. I leave that issue for the moment and draw attention to the fact that there are still outstanding documents which have not been made available to this Committee. </PARA>

One of the points that Senator Newman has just made-if I recall her terms accurately-is that she has not seen the letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in relation to this matter. I assumed-and the advisers indicate to me that they too assumed-that the letter, which is dated 18 September and date-stamped 19 September as having been received in the Minister's office, has been tabled. That is a letter to the Hon. Kim C. Beazley, MP, Minister for Defence, and signed by the Prime Minister.

There is no undertaking in the letter. I would not want to be holding my breath while the Prime Minister tried to find the money to replace the Defence vote.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now want to turn to the frigate contract. This is a long and involved matter. There is no doubt that the Federal Government has something of a debt to pay to the New South Wales Government because the enormous activity of the New South Wales Government in supporting the Australian Warships Systems (AWS) tender meant that the competition presented to Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) encouraged a much lower price than might otherwise have been the case. As it was, the AMECON tender was about $350m less than the AWS tender. The New South Wales Government activity resulted in massive pressure being brought to bear on AMECON to ensure that a fair proportion of the work would be done in New South Wales even though the New South Wales tender had not been successful. The result is that an offer of about $1,200m of work has been made to New South Wales, including about $700m for Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the contract between the Commonwealth and AMECON was signed on the tenth of this month. But it is also understood that the contract places no binding obligation on AMECON to put work in Newcastle or New South Wales. As I understand it, the only overall obligation is to meet an Australia and New Zealand industry involvement target of 80 per cent. Letters of commitment from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) have been sent to New South Wales reiterating the claims made by AMECON about placement of work in New South Wales and a Cabinet subcommittee has been nominated to oversee the project and to maximise opportunities in the Hunter. That subcommittee is made up of Messrs Beazley and Morris and Senator Button. However, when the Defence Department Deputy Secretary, Dr McIntosh, appeared before the Senate Estimates Committee he stated that the Defence Department could not give any firm guarantees as to the level of work that Newcastle or New Zealand would get from the Anzac ship project. He also said that the Federal Government could, if it wanted to, approve the removal of work if there were sufficient reasons, such as significant industrial disputes or large cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government has written to, and sought clarification and assurances from, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and members of the Cabinet subcommittee. The Deputy Premier of New South Wales and the Chairman of the Hunter Economic Development Council have written and, as I understand it, no satisfactory guarantees have been made in response to those letters. Now that the South Australian election is out of the way and any questions of allocating goodies in South Australia will no longer be an election issue, I suppose we have to recognise that a Federal election will be coming up early in the next year. As most of the marginal seats in the coming Federal election appear to be in Melbourne, no doubt the Government could well have political objectives in being fairly relaxed about whether it will stick by its undertakings to Newcastle in particular, and New South Wales in general, that they will get their share of the contract, particularly as absolutely no guarantees have been given. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, this Government cannot keep treating Newcastle with contempt or it will find that there will be the same sort of response at the next Federal election from the Newcastle region that there was at the State election. I confidently expect swings of up to 15 per cent against Labor if this Government keeps up its arrogant disregard of Newcastle and the Hunter region which is evident in its treatment of the region on this frigate matter. It is about time that some hard and fast guarantees were given about the work.</PARA>
<PARA> This offer of about 40 per cent of the Australian contract work for New South Wales has been made on several occasions and was reaffirmed by AMECON on 11 October. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the letters from Mr Beazley and Mr Hawke to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, on these matters. </PARA>

<PARA>My dear Premier</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 11 August 1989, signed jointly by yourself, the Leader of the NSW Opposition, the Secretary of the Labour Council of NSW and the Mayor of Newcastle, concerning the ANZAC Frigate Project. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say that the ANZAC Ship source selection decision was in no way influenced by any misconceptions regarding Newcastle's ability to undertake this project. I had full confidence in the region's workforce, industrial relations and economic and social infrastructure. I was also most impressed by the energy and solidarity displayed by the people of Newcastle in support of their bid for the project. Like yourselves, I give no credence to the notion that Newcastle is suitable only for low technology industry. The ability of the Hunter to manage this project, the benefits it could provide to the region and the advantages of the M Frigate were fully considered in the source selection decision. However, the large price advantage inherent in the AMECON bid, $350 million or 10% of the contract value, and the management, financial arrangements, logistics support and industry package aspects contained in AMECON's tender made it the clear cut choice for the contract award. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it did not secure the prime contract, Newcastle will gain enormously from its share of the project work. The project will bring to Newcastle a full range of shipbuilding skills, not only the traditional steel fabrication work. Other areas in NSW will also benefit and the State will receive about 40% of the work in Australia on the project. </PARA>
<PARA> A Cabinet Committee, comprising myself, Peter Morris, the Minister for Industrial Relations and Senator John Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has been established to maximise opportunities for the Hunter to participate in the Frigate Project and ensure that it receives its fair share of electronic and engineering work. </PARA>

You will be aware that the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Hudson, has publicly stated the Navy's total satisfaction with the MEKO 200 design and emphasised that the Navy decision to recommend selection of AMECON was independent and preceded further higher committee consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has from the outset fully recognised the important role which the project would be able to play in promoting the restructuring and development of Australian industry. We have consistently stated that price and industry participation would be key factors in the tender decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Both consortiums offered excellent designs and industry participation packages. The AMECON tender was, however, $350m lower than the AWS bid. As you would appreciate, this margin far exceeds the two percent cost differential which you nominated in our meeting on 4 August as an acceptable premium for placing the ANZAC Ship contract with the Newcastle-based consortium for regional development purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would take this opportunity to emphasise that NSW, and the Hunter region in particular, stands to benefit greatly from the ANZAC Ship tender decision. Under the AMECON bid, $700m will need to be invested in Newcastle industry and some 1,200 jobs will be created there. AMECON plans to build 58 hull sections and assemble and launch 5 of the twelve ships built at Newcastle. Overall, NSW will have about 40% of the industry work in Australia, matching the level of work going to Victoria. The share of work going to NSW stands to approach 50% in the event that New Zealand decides not to participate in the Project. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 August, after the Government's selection of the AMECON tender, I had useful and constructive discussions in Canberra with the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, Alderman McNaughton. I can assure you, as I assured Alderman McNaughton at our meeting, that the Federal Government is committed to working in full cooperation with the New South Wales Government to develop proposals for the advancement of the Hunter region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government looks forward to a continuation of the bi-partisan approach which characterised the lead-up to the decision on the frigate project. I am confident that NSW will admirably meet the challenges of participation in this major defence project and that work on the ANZAC ships will do much to develop Newcastle as an important shipbuilding centre into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written in similar terms to Mr Carr and Mr Easson and have discussed these issues with Alderman McNaughton. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the chamber. I restate that the contract between AMECON and the Commonwealth places no obligation on AMECON to put work in Newcastle or New South Wales. As I understand it, AMECON has declined to reveal details of its potential subcontractors-in other words, to test where the work is to be done-claiming that its bids are commercial in confidence. This, of course, imposes a severe constraint on the New South Wales Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Industrial Supplies Office of that State in discharging their legitimate role of encouraging New South Wales industry to seek business with AMECON as first, second or even third tier subcontractors. It would be noted that the prime contract is a fixed price turn key contract bounded by function and performance specifications and by local industry guarantees. Selected subcontractors will be identified in an annex to the contract. The prime contractor will have considerable freedom to make changes to the SEL within the bounds of the contract. Presumably, AMECON is unlikely to make changes unless it increases its profit margins or lowers technical risks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the longer term, AMECON seems to have no defensible position in refusing to release information as it certainly acts against competition in the attainment of the highest levels of Australian industry involvement. It seems to me that there is no real impediment to AMECON releasing a list of all the alternative major subcontractors now. Has the Government any intention of suggesting to AMECON that it might do that in the period since 10 November? When will the Government give an iron-clad commitment, or when will it require an iron-clad commitment, relating to the $700m of work at Newcastle? Will it do so before the next Federal election, or will it duck it? I believe that it is important that AMECON's intentions for the State dockyard site in Newcastle should be revealed before the next Federal election, and I believe that AMECON's list of potential subcontractors should be revealed before the next Federal election in order to permit New South Wales industry to place competitive bids for the work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I would like to make in response to Senator Michael Baume is that, when we take into consideration all the subcontractors who have had to deal with AMECON in the preparation of its bid, we have to remember that AMECON has had to go out and seek competitive bids from a whole range of subcontractors and make its decisions before it comes to the Government. All of that having been done, these subcontractors are under a contractual obligation to AMECON to perform. On the assumption that each and every subcontractor performs, I do not see any problem at all. Nothing would change in AMECON's intentions and every bit of the promised percentage to Newcastle would go to Newcastle. But it would not be responsible, let alone proper, for the Government to insist that each and every part of the subcontractor work takes place with the intended subcontractor if that company could not perform. In a massive contract like this, one cannot deny that it is imaginable that some will not perform, be it for whatever reason-industrial relations obviously being one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That does not all work to make one think that in some way Newcastle might suffer. It could well be that the Victorian or South Australian components of this contract do not perform and that more work will need to be sent to New South Wales. There is no guarantee that any inability to perform has to be in Newcastle. Like Senator Michael Baume, as a New South Wales senator I have faith in the Newcastle end of this business holding up its end, performing creditably and delivering on its promises. That being the case, none of us has a worry. In the Estimates hearing of 10 October Dr McIntosh, in referring to AMECON, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It had gone out and got bids from subcontractors all around Australia and New Zealand and overseas for those parts and its tender was based on those costs. The expectation quite clearly was if those costs were maintained by the subcontractors and they were firmly bid to the winner, that is where they would stay. That is the basis on which the contract is being drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA>Further to that, when talking about the main contract, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>He would have to put in a contract change proposal to make those changes and we-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>would have to agree to the contract change proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>That places AMECON in a very difficult position if it is choosing to walk away from any part of the work. Dr McIntosh's answer in response to a question from Senator Baume is pretty relevant to what Senator Baume is talking about now. Senator Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been advised that Transfield, for example, has no contractual obligation whatsoever to undertake the proportion outlined in Newcastle or even in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr McIntosh said:</PARA>
<PARA>That `whatsoever' I would not agree with. It has no absolute requirement, but it certainly has quite a strong requirement to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Baume was told then still applies. What is more of concern to me tonight is that AMECON-Senator Baume referred in his question to Transfield Engineering, but AMECON is a bit more than just Transfield, so I will refer to it rather than Transfield-has shown not the slightest hint that it wants in any way to walk away from promises it has made to the Newcastle end of the deal. I have had some talks with AMECON. Like many members from New South Wales, I have had representations from, for example, the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, not to mention people such as Allan Morris, the honourable member for Newcastle. Because of those representations I have subsequently spoken to some people from AMECON to ask them what their intentions were. They have made it very clear to me that all the undertakings they have given the Government about what work will be done in New South Wales and what percentage of it will be done in Newcastle will be kept. They saw no problems with them and were proceeding along the lines they had indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us not attempt to talk up some withdrawal of what Newcastle will get. It would seem to me that Newcastle will get the work but, as in any other part of Australia or indeed New Zealand, if a company in Newcastle cannot perform, AMECON would have the right to approach the Government about going somewhere else. But, given the faith that I have in Newcastle, that may well mean that, as contractors fall down in other places, the Newcastle percentage of this contract will be increased rather than decreased. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that very full response. My expectations would be that industrial relations in Newcastle would be far better than they are likely to be in Williamstown in Melbourne. That is one of the reasons why I would have thought there was a burden of benefit in providing the tender to the New South Wales tenderer in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned about two other matters. The first is the price expectation of a $350m cut in the sense that the AMECON tender is $350m less than the Australian Warships Systems one was. Secondly, and in particular, the New South Wales Labor movement, particularly under Michael Easson, has been totally and completely cooperative and responsible in its response to this whole project-far more so than has been evidenced in Victoria. Newcastle has been through its traumas. They are well and truly over. There is a spirit of cooperation and determination in Newcastle that, quite frankly, does not exist at Williamstown to my knowledge. My impression is that a lot of the scars of the recent disputes in Williamstown are still there. There is a more cooperative and progressive work force in Newcastle. I think it recognises the changed direction. I believe it is absolutely vital to the morale of that work force that something more positive than the assurances that have been given take place, by way of either contractual statement or something else. But I take the Minister's point about assurances from AMECON rather than from Transfield. I beg the pardon of Mr Belgiorno Nettis. He had also given an assurance that he would stick by the Newcastle commitments. I do not believe that I am just being like Oliver Twist, asking for more. I think the Newcastle work force deserves a greater sense of commitment than is given in the statements that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some other problems with this contract, relating to the $350m price difference. As I understand it from Senate Estimates, it was the price difference which was the essential difference between the two tenders and all other things were held to be equal. I have some problems about that, too. I want an assurance that when the contract was signed it was for the original price. I have heard a lot of rumours of something like a $400m price rise, one way or another. If that has taken place, it would raise serious questions about the merit of that tender price. Perhaps we can look into that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another question to be answered. It relates to Blohn and Voss, who have retained Signaal to advise and assist in design issues surrounding the integration of equipment into the Anzac frigate. The Swedish Government has asked Ferranti of the United Kingdom and PEAB, which is now BEAB, to advise it on the design of the combat system, the quality of which in relation to the Anzac ship specifications is now apparently of great concern to the Swedish Government. </PARA>
<PARA> AMECON offered the BEAB combat system after positive guidance, as I understand it, by Defence officials during the tendering process because the system AMECON preferred, which, I understand, was Sintacs, was ruled out by Defence on cost capability grounds. I now understand that the PEAB system, which has already been of questionable relevance to a frigate, has failed on a Norwegian ship and, as a result, the Swedish Government has selected Ferranti of the United Kingdom to assist the now BEAB to redesign the system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a question to be answered here. Maybe it can be resolved satisfactorily. I am concerned that there is, perhaps, evidence of Australia entering into a contract with an unproven and perhaps even now failed combat system, that is, unproven in terms of AMECON, and that this technical risk is a little compounded by the Commonwealth not insisting that Blohn and Voss be part of, or a shareholder in, the prime contractor. I ask the Minister to respond on these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would welcome any colleague from Victoria. As soon as he got here he would probably knock one of you lot off and I would be delighted. Senator Baume mentioned that he thinks the scars of recent disputes are still in Williamstown. To be fair to John Halfpenny, who I think behaved very responsibly in this exercise, and to the Victorian unions, the industrial package which was achieved at Williamstown was a landmark package for Australian industrial relations. I do not think I could suggest even by implication to Senator Baume or to the Senate that it was lacking. I believe that that agreement will stand the test of time. In another category, which has nothing to do with Anzac ships, but with the Antarctic ship which I am trying to have built at Carringtons, there was a four-day strike there a few days ago. So not everyone in Newcastle does what we would like, even though I have the highest regard for Carringtons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Baume does not fall victim to a tendency being shown by a number of his colleagues on other matters, and that is of believing or parroting the line given to him by the losers in any contract battle. This one was very hard fought. In the weeks leading up to the decision, like Senator Baume I was lobbied by AMECON and by AWS. They were beating paths to my door, to other Ministers' doors, to Premiers' doors and all the rest of it. I took the opportunity of noting down all the complaints that AMECON made to me. I actually had a briefing from Defence prior to the Cabinet decision. I think Admiral Beaumont and Dr McIntosh were the two people who came to see me. I put to them many of the points put to me-the facts, to hark back to a debate yesterday-by the AWS group. But these facts turned out not to be facts, or to be non-facts, when examined. The main thrust of the AWS line was that in some way this was a vastly inferior ship. Certainly they were able to allay my fears as to whether that was true. So I had no problems with the decision to go ahead with an AMECON bid. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the factors that weighed most heavily in the minds of the Cabinet in making that decision, I think I was typical of all the members of the Cabinet in that certainly we felt that the price differential-given what I said to the honourable senator earlier, which is that there was no great difference between the two vessels-was just too great for us to walk away from. But the $350m, which was certainly an apples versus apples comparison, was if anything underdone by Defence. In an effort to ensure that no-one could query the absolute use of discretion by Defence, the absolute lack of bias by Defence, it bent over backwards to give AWS a fair go. On my reading of the figures, certainly the $350m was way under what I thought the difference was. In any event, the $350m difference has been increased to a $500m difference on the signing of the contract by the choosing of some cheaper options. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator mentioned this PEAB system, which was selected on an existing system, so that one could actually see how it was in operation, compared with the alternative, which was not in operation. So, it had nothing to do with cost capability. I am advised that we are unaware of any combat system failure with this system. </PARA>

Nonetheless, I think that some of the things seem to be of such moment that it is better to get them out of the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the PEAB system, what concerns me is that I have been under the impression that this combat command and control equipment and systems-which is probably the highest value area of the contract, valued at $900m for eight ships-could be in some kind of doubt in relation to its design and performance. I understand from the Minister's earlier response that there are no doubts and that he has heard no comments that it is critical. I must say that I am interested in that, because the information I was given was that the Swedish Government did have some concern, together with the fact that the actual system needed to meet specification is nowhere near in existence and, at best, there is only one derivative on a Danish inshore patrol boat. I assume from the shaking of the head that that is also a furphy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I am always concerned about the scope for escalation in contracts. We are sitting in a building which is the classic example of escalation of costs in contracts. In fact, the Department of Defence is aware of escalation in contracts. The HMAS Success is the classic example of escalations in contracts. To what extent are there special arrangements in this contract which will in fact prevent the sorts of escalations that we have seen in so many of these Defence Department contracts?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Minister is getting that information: in 1986-87 I think the Budget approval figure for the FFG contract was about $859m, while it is now $1,216m-something like a 40 per cent increase. That was my advice; I do not know how accurate it is. But there does seem to be potential for continuing rises in these types of contracts. In simple terms, as I see it, this means that the estimated FFG program cost has escalated by some 50 per cent in the three years surrounding the sale of the Williamstown dockyard. My point is that if a similar sort of escalation took place in this case we would be looking at some horrendous cost increases. </PARA>

Obviously there is some allowance for exchange rate variations, and it is always possible to have some big variations there, but nothing of the order that the honourable senator is speaking of in that other contract. With the change in the situation at Williamstown, I would imagine that the impetus for the big cost increase would be gone anyway, even if it were not a fixed price contract. I think if that same contract were run through again we would do very much better.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that is so, because of the changed structure, how can AMECON guarantee the performance of the ship to the Commonwealth's satisfaction, when the Commonwealth does not know the nature of that relationship, as I understand it, and does not in fact have direct access to the design agent, as it would have had under the original structure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One final point I wanted to raise basically is the question of what happens in relation to this fixed price contract if the contractor seeks variations. There must be some appropriate structure for variations. The reality is that there is no such thing as a fixed price contract in this business, no matter what the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) says. It sounds beaut, but there is no such thing. There is always a capacity for significant variations. I wonder what the basis of variation is and what structures exist to supervise the variations. What would be the role of the Auditor-General in such cases?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise the matter specifically from my experience of looking at what happened in the case of building this new Parliament House building. The Auditor-General dramatised the fact that a failure to provide effective cost control created real problems. The Minister might well say that that is up to the principal contractor, but I cannot imagine that in such a situation the Commonwealth Government would allow the principal contractor to go broke if, for example, costs had got away for a variety of reasons. I want to reassure myself that at this point the Commonwealth knows of no potential cost rises of any substance that are in the pipeline or could reasonably be expected to be in the pipeline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things that certainly impressed me about the AMECON bid-and I am sure that it had a similar effect on my Cabinet colleagues-was the quality of documentation and the comparison between it and that offered by the competitor. There was no doubt that the documentation received from AMECON showed that the AMECON consortium had a much more detailed grasp of this contract than did its opponents. AMECON provided a document of some 3,000 pages of the most detailed cost breakdown to provide the Commonwealth with a cost control system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member has said, there is always provision for variation in contracts, and I do not read too often of their being varied down; it is always up. However, a variation would require the agreement of the two parties. By going into the very detailed specifications that it did, I think that AMECON is fairly well tied down, much more than I have ever known in the case of a government contract of this kind. While I cannot here rule out that there will ever be a cost increase, I do not believe that it is possible for any massive cost increase to occur, because of the very detailed cost control system that we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I genuinely appreciate the way in which the Minister has handled this matter. I have one last question on the subject. I am advised that the other area of financial risk, if there is one, is in the area of integrated logistic support (ILS), including spares, training and so on. One of the reasons why AMECON's bid ended up at an evaluated price of $350m below that of Australian Warships Systems (AWS) was, as I understand it, simply that this ILS offering was, if not innovative, certainly non-conforming to the tender requirements and structured in a way that could create risk for the Commonwealth. As I understand it, the very considerable cost differential in the ILS field between the two bids was caused by AMECON's bidding to provide on-board and on-shore regular use spares but guaranteeing their availability, rather than undertaking to provide the other spares as required in the tender. Guaranteeing the availability rather than providing the other spares as required seems to me to be a significant difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would think that this approach should have been discussed with potential subcontractors, and I understand that it was not, therefore, it has been put to me that, in effect, neither the Commonwealth nor AMECON has any idea whether AMECON's ILS approach will be accepted by major subcontractors and, if it is, at a price that conforms with the AMECON BAFO price. Given the value of the ILS-about $800m-it has been put to me that a good deal of this proposal is a best guess guarantee from AMECON. Again, the scope for escalation in this area of the contract could be considerable unless the Department of Defence has done a better job than usual with the wording of the contract. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot claim to have seen the wording of the contract, but I can say that I have been impressed throughout by the way in which the Department of Defence has handled the matter. I have not been able to find any fault, and that applies to all the debates we have had both in this place and in the Government. So this is one occasion on which I cannot complain about the Department, unlike when it prepares replies on the proposal for Jervis Bay, but that is a matter for another day. I made some comments to Mr Ives earlier about what I thought of the Department's performance in that respect. I do not think there is any suggestion that subcontractors do not know what AMECON has promised with regard to the integrated logistic support (ILS) system. My understanding is that they are all well and truly aware of the situation. With regard to the potential in that case for cost blow-outs, again I think it is fair to say that, with regard to this ILS part of the contact, AMECON provided much more detail. In fact, this was one of the questions I asked when I was given a briefing some months ago. I have to say that AMECON was much more convincing in the documentation it presented. Since I am not expert in the field, I cannot claim to have understood every syllable; but, when explained to me by those who do understand, it certainly looked to be the goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to cost differentials, the important point to note is that, while the $350m difference was, as I have already said, I think very conservative, nonetheless it was worked out on an apples with apples comparison. I do not think that anyone doubted at the end that it was an apples with apples comparison. There is no doubt in my mind-and I have not even heard a doubt expressed-that by the end of the process we had got that right. What has happened is that, because AMECON offered some cheaper options on ILS, it is possible to make the $350m difference greater. Part of the reason why the $350m difference has gone to $500m relates to that particular point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude by drawing the Minister's attention to a matter that he has no doubt already had drawn to his attention. Senator Newman and I recently visited Philips Defence Systems Pty in Moorebank, New South Wales. As a result of that visit, I received a letter which, states amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In amplification of a letter (attached) sent to the Minister for State Development, we wish to bring to your attention our concern that New South Wales is facing the very real threat of losing (or having significantly degraded) a key element of its defence electronics capabilities as a consequence of the ANZAC Frigate Project being awarded to AMECON. Further more, we believe that, unless urgent action is taken, South Australia will win the predominant share of industry involvement in the ships' combat system. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention this because I have tended, as Senator Richardson noted, to concentrate on rumours, reports and the like, but here I have a letter from a significant defence contractor who, I understand, has a good record in supplying the Department of Defence and who expressed to me at the time, and he has now put it in writing, real concern about the consequences of that contract for this industry in New South Wales. The company clearly feels unconvinced by the assurances given so far and is looking to the contractual situation. I wonder what can be done, and how soon it can be done, to give such companies the opportunity to participate in this project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter brought to my attention today by a community nurse in Canberra. I think it is simplest and quickest to read what she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was very interesting to see that the Minister for Industrial Relations recently ``welcomed a 3% pay rise for public servants'' . . . Meanwhile his colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was quietly preparing to implement what amounts to an effective pay cut of 18% for part time nurses who provide home nursing services to ageing veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> It's being done so quietly that it took two days of intensive telephone inquiry with the Minister's office and his Department at the most senior levels to find anyone who could or would explain the cut to me. The cut was first made known through a Domiciliary Nursing Circular dated 1 September which stated in rather vague terms that ``home visit travel by providers [are they frightened to call us Nurses?] in their local area will no longer be reimbursed''. </PARA>
<PARA> We nurses work as casuals earning about $18.00 for a one hour home visit, plus mileage allowance of about 40 cents a kilometre up to 16 kilometres for using our own cars (travelling time of 35 to 45 minutes is unpaid and unlike the States, Veterans' Affairs won't provide cars). As a cost cutting measure the Minister has decreed that the first ten kilometres of travel will be unpaid. On top of the limit of 16 kilometres already imposed, this means that the maximum contribution of the Government to our very considerable transport costs will be a miserable allowance for six kilometres. I wonder how many public servants would be willing to use their own cars on Government business under such terms and conditions?</PARA>
<PARA> In response to my telephone inquiry, I was told that our rates of pay actually include a component for travel. This is sheer nonsense. No matter how they try to disguise it the bare facts are that our income will be cut by about $4.00 for each visit. At $18.00 for a one hour visit (with no sick pay, annual leave, paid travelling time, workers compensation or professional indemnity), there is no proposal for any compensating increase. A cut in income of $4.00 may not sound much, but it means a cut of $40 to $60 out of a total income of $220 to $330 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a hard hitting move by the Minister and his (predominantly male) bureaucrats against a group of caring and dedicated women-women who are generally forced to accept part time work for many different reasons. So much for the Labor Government's concern for social justice, especially for the plight of women. We will be forced to take a massive cut in income but we are a group who can least afford it!</PARA>
<PARA> The pity of it all is that it is the old veterans who will suffer in the end because the Government will find it increasingly hard to find trained nurses who are willing to accept the penny-pinching approach of the Minister and his Department. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, of course, that these women have had a hard time from the Department of Veterans' Affairs for a very long time. It was not so long ago that, on many occasions, I had to chase the Department for weeks to get the payment that was due to the nurses for the work they were doing. It is an unconscionable act on the part of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and his Department to seek to make ends meet by cutting some of the most vulnerable employees within the Department. As the nurse who brought this matter to my attention has pointed out, it is the veterans who will suffer in the end. If costs need to be cut there must be other ways of doing it than picking on the domiciliary nursing service in the fashion that I have just read out from this letter. I have a copy of the document that has been referred to, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> When itemising a visit only that time during which a patient is receiving active attention is to be counted. The time taken by a domiciliary nurse to travel to a patient's home is not to be taken into consideration in the determination of the length of the visit. Fees are payable only in respect of the time a patient is receiving active attention. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the rate of pay is $18 per hour, which is not a very handsome rate. This seems to me to be attacking the most vulnerable group, and I think the Minister should be thoroughly ashamed of himself for allowing it to happen. I ask the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), who is in the chamber, whether she will take the matter up with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and point out exactly how harshly either he or his Department is treating these particular nurses, who provide a great service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister might also stop to think about what it would cost to have even one of these veterans admitted to hospital to be looked after. What would that cost to run? Yet the Department cuts down on the domiciliary service. If the Minister thinks that is good management of Veterans' Affairs, I suggest that he look at it again. I can assure him that the cost of having even one veteran admitted to a hospital would be a great deal more, and it could happen, because we do not have sufficient domiciliary nurses prepared to work for the pittance they are now to be paid. The rest of us will be paying a great deal more to maintain a veteran in a hospital rather than in his own home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to abolish the entitlement to travel allowances for home visits was made in the last Budget. In making that decision the Government took into account the fact that fees paid for home or institutional visits include a component to provide remuneration for time lost in travelling. The restrictions apply only in respect of services provided in the practitioner's local area-that is, within a five-kilometre radius. Where a practitioner needs to travel further, normal travel allowances are payable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite these restrictions, allowances paid to practitioners providing services to clients of the Department of Veterans' Affairs are still significantly more generous than those paid by Medicare, other government departments and private health insurance organisations. Domiciliary services paid for under these arrangements do not allow for any travelling allowances to be paid, and I am advised that it would be most unusual for a provider to ask a patient to pay for travel. Nevertheless, Senator Reid has asked for the particular letter that she quoted from to be brought to the attention of the Minister and I am happy to take that letter to the Minister for his personal response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one other matter I wish to raise, which I will leave to be responded to at some other time. I do not require it during the time that we are looking into this Department. I will accept a reply in due course and take such action as is necessary if that does not happen. The Minister will no doubt remember that the Government transferred arrangements for defence service home loans from the Defence Service Homes Corporation to Westpac Banking Corporation. Much of the literature put out at the time indicated that those people who were purchasing their homes through the Corporation would not pay more under the new arrangements. I refer to two documents. The first is headed `Defence Service Home Loan Changes'. It is a printed document with a drawing of a house in the middle. It states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For existing DSH borrowers the present terms and conditions remain unchanged, however payments are now made at a Westpac branch. </PARA>
<PARA>The other document is a letter, sent presumably to all purchasers through the scheme, from the Defence Service Homes Corporation which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The interest rate on your loan will not change and your monthly repayments will not increase. </PARA>
<PARA>To an extent, that is true. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . purchasers will continue to enjoy the same loan terms as at present. </PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at a statement of account of any purchaser under the Corporation, it clearly stated the principal amount and the deductions made each month; no other charges were levied against the account. But, if one looks at the Westpac account which is now sent to each purchaser, it is clear that there is a deduction made for a government duty on deposits-a deduction that it would seem is made every two months. That is a charge which was not borne by those purchasing through the Defence Service Homes Corporation prior to the change that the Government made transferring the arrangements to Westpac. In paying the money to Westpac, a bank account is established in the name of the purchaser and, according to the correspondence from Westpac, it then has no choice but to pay the government charge on that account as would be the case on any other bank account with Westpac. There is no way around it. To pay cash does not help because an account is still established in the name of the purchaser. It may be said that the amount that has to be paid under this financial institutions duty is not very much. That may be the case, but it still means that all purchasers are paying a charge that they were not paying previously, which is in contravention of all the literature that was sent out to purchasers prior to the change and which said that they would enjoy the same loan terms and that the terms and conditions would remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the question is: Will the Government make arrangements so that these accounts with Westpac are not debited with this charge and for the charges that have already been debited to be refunded? Of course, what will happen eventually is that these people will not be paying off their mortgage in the way they thought because the debt will be growing each two months by the amount of duty being deducted from the account. So the monthly repayment will not meet the commitment that the purchasers thought they were meeting under the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two issues that have been raised by Senator Reid are two that have been drawn to my attention quite considerably by constituents and I am pleased that they have been drawn to the attention of the Minister. I also will be anxious to see the responses because they are concerns that are truly held by the veteran community. I would like to move on to a third concern which has come to me from a number of veterans. It may well be that there is a misinterpretation by them and that that could possibly be clarified. I will read a letter from a constituent which cites the anomaly that seems to concern quite a number of totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners who are concerned about the situation when eventually their wives will become war widows by virtue of their passing. I will read directly from a constituent's letter recently received. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am writing to draw your attention to a serious anomaly which has developed with regard to War Widows. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a totally and permanently incapacitated veteran and on my death my wife will automatically become a War Widow. </PARA>
<PARA>He then refers to an article which appeared in a publication called Age Pension News, Issue No. 2. Unfortunately, I do not have the date of that publication because it is not shown on the copy of this article. The article under the heading `Extra Security for the bereaved' cites the generous provision of bereavement allowances contained in the Budget. But there is an anomaly which suggests that that generosity will not, in fact, be extended to war widows who find themselves disadvantaged relative to ordinary pensioners who receive these benefits. The constituent goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> On reading a copy of Issue 2 of Age Pension News. . . I found that from next January a widow of an age pensioner would receive after her husband's death, and over the next seven paydays, the total amount that would otherwise have been received by the couple. It was pointed out that this could amount to $1247. </PARA>
<PARA>The article in the Age Pension News sees that as a very positive and a quite generous provision for the bereaved. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I twice contacted Veterans' Affairs, and once Department of Social Security inquiring about the situation with regard to War Widows and was told on each occasion that the information available to them indicated that War Widows would only receive the $550 funeral allowance currently available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a savage discrimination against War Widows and can only be the result of some stupid mistake or omission. </PARA>
<PARA> I would greatly appreciate your looking into this matter . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My question to the Minister is therefore: Is this an anomaly or is it perhaps a misunderstanding by the author of the article, which has been compounded by a misunderstanding by the author of this letter? However, it is an anomaly which has been drawn to my attention by several other veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 10 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) With reference to an article in the Weekend Australian of 19-20 August 1989 headed `Budding export market for the seeds of our native trees', what was the volume in financial terms of exports of Australian native tree seeds in the financial years 1986-87, 1987-88, and, if available, 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What is the projected value of this export industry in the current financial year, and what are the estimates for the long-term future.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Which varieties of Australian trees are being exported, and where are Australia's main markets.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) There are no specific statistics regarding exports of Australian native tree seeds. The figure of $7 million per annum quoted by Stephen Midgley in the Weekend Australian is an informal estimate given by the Australian Tree Seed Centre (CSIRO) and compiled after enquiries to the major exporters. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not distinguish Australian Native tree seeds from others in its figures.</PARA>
<PARA> The industry could grow significantly especially if it moved seriously into the production of improved seed. The demand for Australian eucalypt seed far exceeds the supply and there is potential for the establishment of seed orchards specifically for this purpose utilising available expertise in genetic resources and breeding strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The main varieties exported are Eucalyptus, Acacia and Casuarina but other genera such as Grevillea and Melaleuca are receiving increased attention. The main markets for native tree seeds are South Africa, Spain, Portugal, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At present commercial seed companies have no difficulty in procuring markets. The Australian Tree Seed Centre of the CSIRO collaborates with Australian and international research institutions, development assistance agencies and companies in the provision of certified seed and specialised services. Consultation with commercial seed operators has indicated that due to the level of demand there is great scope for further collection and production. There is no formal marketing and promotion effort by the Government.</PARA>
