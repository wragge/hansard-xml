<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for his suggestion. Honourable senators will be interested to hear the response of the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, to the motion of 17 August that the Government explain in detail the reasoning behind the Government's decision to increase the postal entitlement for members of parliament. The response is along these lines:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Increase in Entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>In its 1988 Review, the Remuneration Tribunal determined that Senators and Members be provided with access to the full range of Australia Post's postal services . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are then listed. They include:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ordinary mail, including the re-setting of credit for a franking machine, parcels, priority paid, certified mail, express courier, fax post, imagegram, lettergram, bulk lettergram, bulk direct mail service, householder delivery service. </PARA>
<PARA>The response goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>In a subsequent determination, the Tribunal also determined that Senators and Members should continue to be supplied with either a certain amount of stamps or stamped envelopes in Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal determined that the postage entitlement be limited to an amount of $9,000 per annum with any amounts not utilised in one financial year not being carried over to the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's view that Members of the House of Representatives, who traditionally are in a much closer relationship with their constituents-</PARA>
<PARA>it is the Government saying this, not me-</PARA>
<PARA>should have an increased capacity to communicate directly with them. The postage entitlement has therefore been increased by the equivalent cost of sending a letter once each year to each constituent in an average sized electorate. In order to achieve this outcome at the most economic cost consistent with efficient dissemination, the amount to be made available to supplement existing postal budgets has been calculated on the bulk mailing rate. This is a reduction of some 25 per cent on the ordinary mailing rate which, from 1 September, will increase to 41c per item. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of honourable senators to that increase from 1 September-41c. The response goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Remuneration Tribunal's determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 the Government can request the Tribunal to inquire into and either determine or report on a matter specified in a notice in writing, being a matter that is or is considered by the Government to be significantly related to the question of parliamentary remuneration. In its first referral, pursuant to sub-section 7 (4) (b) of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 the then Government, in 1976-</PARA>
<PARA>that was the Liberal-National Party Government of 1976-</PARA>
<PARA>requested the Tribunal to inquire into and determine a range of matters relating to members of Parliament including Ministers. In that and successive years the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of the entitlements of members of Parliament, including Ministers, has been limited to the range of matters referred by the Government of the day. The Remuneration Tribunal, in each of its relevant annual determinations, has formally acknowledged that certain entitlements such as the location, nature and extent of office accommodation, office furniture and equipment newspapers and the like remain within the discretion of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 the then Government-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian Labor Party Government-</PARA>
<PARA>withdrew from the Remuneration Tribunal's jurisdiction the capacity to determine a Senator's or Member's entitlement to electorate staff and increased the staffing level. It was therefore inappropriate to continue to treat the issue of electorate staff terms and conditions as being matters relevant to the remuneration of Senators and Members. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I remind the Senate that these are not my words; they are the Minister's. The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In its 1988 review the Remuneration Tribunal changed the basis of the postage entitlement from one whereby Senators and Members were provided with a quarterly franking machine credit and access to stamps and stamped envelopes in Parliament House to an arrangement whereby Senators and Members were provided with credit card access to the full range of postal services. In line with the previous decision about electorate staff, the postage entitlement has now been recognised as an office facility rather than an entitlement relating to Senators' and Members' remuneration. In brief, the Government has concluded that decisions on the facilities and entitlements necessary for a Senator or Member to maintain and operate an electorate office are more appropriately matters for consideration by Government. Consequently, the Government has on 20 July 1989 and pursuant to sub-section 7 (4) (b) of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973, withdrawn the matter from the Tribunal's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Increase for members of the House of Representatives</PARA>
<PARA> The concept behind the increase in the postage entitlement for Members of the House of Representatives is that each Member should be given the capacity to send a letter once each year to each constituent in an average sized electorate. The cost of increasing the entitlement to achieve this is $3.185 million in 1989/90. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of extending the entitlement to Senators in order to provide them with the capacity to write directly to each person on the electoral roll within their State would be in excess of $38.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA>This is really drawing the long bow. The response continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Based on recent enrolment statistics, the entitlement for each Senator representing a State would range from $1,115,263 for a Senator for New South Wales to $95,567 for a Senator for Tasmania and for senators representing the ACT and the NT, the cost would be $53,207 and $24,057 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>Other matters</PARA>
<PARA>Appropriations</PARA>
<PARA> Funds for the increase in the postal entitlement have been included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) which is presently before the House of Representatives. Interim funds for postage have been appropriated to the Department of Administrative Services by the Supply Bills passed by the Parliament last Session in order to meet the costs of Senators' and Members' entitlements pending the passage of the Appropriation Bills. In line with usual practice, if additional funds are required to meet the cost of Senator's and Members' entitlements, they will be sought from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Government's response in respect of this disgraceful increase in postal allowances from $9,000 to $30,525-an increase in expenditure on members of the House of Representatives of roughly $3.2m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two dollars-next April, Senator Walters. Next April the pensioners get the $2. I want to make it perfectly clear that the coalition parties are opposed to this increase. It is not that we seek the same allowance for senators. We are totally opposed to this increase. Let me go a step further, Mr President. Let me put it on the record: when we get into government, if this allowance is still in continuation, we will abolish it. We will allow this matter to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, as it should be. Let there be no doubt. I repeat: we are opposed to this and we will abolish it. Indeed, we understand that the Government made a submission along these lines to the Tribunal and that the Tribunal rejected it. I see that Senator Ray does not deny it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many of you are going to give it back? Come on!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that he does not deny it. Let me just say that, as far as we are concerned, this allowance is not for the purpose of servicing the electorate. As my colleague Senator Chaney said, it is in fact for the purpose of seducing the electorate. This is all to do with direct mail campaigns. The experience in the United States is that it has been demonstrated that direct mail campaigns have a great ability to maintain members in marginal seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is clearly an attempt by the Labor Party to keep its marginal seats, which it will lose-let there be no doubt about it-notwithstanding this rort. There is no doubt that the Labor Party is rorting the system. The Labor Party is endeavouring to transfer the cost of the re-election campaign of the Labor Party from its own funds to the funds of the taxpayers of this nation. That is what it is all about: the Labor Party is rorting the system, rorting the taxpayers' funds, to get itself re-elected to government. There is no doubt about that. The Government has provided for unlimited stationery for members of the House of Representatives so that they can get an enormous amount of material printed. I see that some honourable senators on the back bench have consciences. I notice a few people who are concerned about this. I see one or two over there who have consciences. As for Senator Walsh coming in here and abusing people for their expenditure and allowing this rort of the system to go through, I am ashamed that he is acting along those lines. He ought to be totally ashamed of himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also talking at the same time about public funding of election campaigns. It has a proposal for free advertising time on commercial television and radio, at the same time as it is proposing to eliminate paid advertising. The Government is producing glossies such as the one I am holding. How much is that costing the taxpayers of Australia, Senator Richardson, with your pooncey photograph there? How much are those glossy papers costing? How much has the recent advertising cost the Department of Social Security for that campaign that it ran during July when the election that the Government was going to have in July did not come off? How much did that cost the taxpayers of Australia? It is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about `aNiMaLs'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague asks about `aNiMaLs' monitoring us-not promoting Government programs. Indeed, when one of my staff went to `aNiMaLs' and asked whether he could have a copy of a transcript of a particular document, he was told by the fellow who runs the show, `No, we don't provide the Opposition with anything-not anything'. I could not get a transcript from `aNiMaLs'. At the same time, Senator Walsh is deliberately reducing facilities for the staff of the Senate; he is deliberately reducing the staff of the Senate committees. These are areas over which the Government does not have control. The Government is scared that if our Senate committees inquire into some of these matters, things will be revealed that it does not want revealed. So Senator Walsh is cutting back on Senate facilities. At the same time, he is prepared to allow $3.2m to go to members of the House of Representatives in respect of mail. This is a direct rort of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I question the political legitimacy of this Government's decision to remove by executive fiat postal allowances from the Remuneration Tribunal. I also ask: What is the validity of this policy decision being included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1)? By agreement between the Senate and the Government back in 1965, policy decisions were supposed to be dealt with in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). This decision has been included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and I suspect that it is invalid because of that. We have to question the Government's priorities. As Senator Walters said, where are the Government's priorities in relation to looking after the people of Australia instead of looking after itself? I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate on 17 August, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Our problem with the statement put out by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) is that it did not justify the increase. No justification was provided in the statement for the increase. We have a mechanism for providing that type of justification-the Remuneration Tribunal. It would have seemed to us sensible and reasonable to go to the Tribunal and argue a case. If the Tribunal had then said on the weight of evidence that the increase should be granted, I am sure there would not have been a debate in this place.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on, I said:</PARA>
<PARA>We would accept whatever decision the Tribunal made because the inquiry would be done in an open, fair and reasonable manner. Our concern is not that they have got $30,000 and we have got $9,000 but that no justification whatsoever has been offered. </PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the press reports, that is what I said on 17 August and I reiterate it today. Quite frankly, this lack of justification has left us in a very vulnerable position with regard to the current airline dispute. The Government is basically arguing that what the pilots ought to be doing is going through the correct tribunals and the proper systems. I think that is a reasonable position. How can we then, in relation to this, seek to go outside the system at this time? Quite frankly, I expected a statement today from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) that the increase would be withdrawn. It is simply untenable to argue that members of Parliament ought to be granted, without inquiry, without reference to the proper tribunal or to anybody, an increase of an astonishing amount-in fact, $3m, as Senator Lewis has just said, which has probably been ripped out of the parliamentary appropriations and which could have been directed elsewhere. Although we have not gone through the proper system to obtain an increase, we say to the pilots, who are looking for a 30 per cent increase, that they must go through the proper tribunal. This approach is really not tenable. </PARA>
<PARA> I expected the Government, in an attempt to hold the line with regard to the wage situations in Australia, to withdraw from this as gracefully and with as much dignity as it could manage. However, it has decided to push ahead. I am not sure what anybody in the community can now make of the Government's position with regard to the airline strike. All members of Parliament have been put in a very difficult situation. We have all read the letters in the newspapers and elsewhere pointing to this. Representatives of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots have also referred to this move. It looks as though the Government intends to press ahead. This measure has been included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which, under the Constitution, the Senate is not able to amend. </PARA>
<PARA> But I reiterate that our concern is that at this time and in this situation we ought go through the proper tribunal and discuss and argue for these increases, no matter what they are, in a fair and open way. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks back at the history of the various appropriations for senators and members, one finds that this Government has been quite mindful of the need for adequate facilities for members and senators. I do not wish to be drawn into that particular debate or even to be seen to be supporting some of the comments that Senator Lewis made with regard to that; the comments from my Party are specifically and entirely directed to the mode by which this occurred. We believe that at this time the only appropriate way of dealing with this matter is to take it to the Remuneration Tribunal. I hope that Senator Ray in response will recognise the validity of that. I believe that at this point that would be the best way of dealing with the matter. If there is a case, which Senator Ray argued strongly there was on 17 August, when we last discussed this matter, I am sure that, given his oratorial skills, he can carry that debate with the Tribunal. If he cannot carry it with the Tribunal, we will leave that aside: it is not something that the Tribunal feels is justified on this occasion. But proceeding in the way proposed does not leave us with a great deal of dignity in confronting the move currently being made by the pilots for a 30 per cent pay increase. The Government, quite frankly, is not left with many arguments when it says to the pilots, `You go through the proper tribunals; we however, will simply give ourselves a 30 per cent increase in our postage allowance'. </PARA>

We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walters's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>

<PARA>To the President and members of the Senate assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned medical students and medical practitioners of Australia, oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. We believe:</PARA>
<PARA> All Australians should have equal access to our health care system and that there should not be two tiers of medical insurance rebates for general practice and we reject the concept of a vocational register for general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> Undergraduate training in general practice should be upgraded and that ongoing medical education should continue to be controlled independently by the profession.</PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism for establishing the vocational register proposed in the legislation violates the ethics of the medical profession as embodied in the Declaration of Geneva, and is totally unacceptable. (See Medical Ethics on the reverse side.)</PARA>
<PARA> We pray that the proposed changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 should be rejected outright by the Senate and that it should be replaced with a broadly based consultative process to address the problems within general medical practice and general practice training.</PARA>

I preface it by referring to the extraordinarily foolish role which has been played by the Prime Minister in the airline pilots dispute at the behest of Mr Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and in a desperate attempt to shore up the failing accord. Firstly, does the Minister agree that the current airline pilots dispute is causing untold damage not merely to Australia's airline industry, but even more importantly to our tourism balance of payments and the Australian economy generally? Secondly, given the Prime Minister's continuing refusal to face reality on the issue, does the Minister agree that it is fortunate that today's decision by Moody's Investor Services Inc. international rating service to downgrade Australia's credit rating was announced now and not in, say, three months' time, when no doubt it would have pushed our rating even lower?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, Senator Stone has attempted to marry two issues into one in a way which I can only describe as inventive. Let me just deal with the Moody's credit rating issue, which he referred to in the second part of the question. I notice that Reuters described Moody's decision this morning as a big yawn, and it is not surprising that the first question to come from Senator Stone is about a big yawn. Let me refer to the substance of the honourable senator's question, which of course was not so much a question as a short speech which might well have been given on the adjournment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, I do agree that the current airline dispute is causing considerable damage to the tourist industry and to the economy and in the potential medium to long term will cause some damage to the balance of payments. The next part of the question is hung on the phrase `the refusal of the Prime Minister to face reality about this dispute'. What is the reality of this dispute, Senator Stone? Is the reality that we give in to the air pilots in this issue? That would have been the reality under a Liberal government; it was the reality under a Liberal government in respect of wages in 1980-82. That would be immensely damaging to this country, because the reality of it is that the productivity of the airline pilots in this country is not good at all compared with productivity in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Stone, as a director of Robe River, wanted to beat his chest about standing up to people in industrial disputes, he did it. But when the Prime Minister says similar sorts of things, it becomes an exercise in unreality. I find this an extraordinary question, coming from Senator Stone. In Senator Stone's political career was the `Joh for Canberra' push a reality and was he involved in it? Was that going to be a good thing for this country? That was a political reality. If we want to talk about political realities in here and who is real about the pilots dispute and who is not, I just draw the honourable senator's attention to the fact that the Government's position has been from the outset that it would support the airlines, the employers concerned, in respect of the appropriate attitude which they took to this dispute. That is what has been done and what will continue to be done by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question. I note with interest the responses of the Minister, which as usual take the form, in part at least, of playing the man rather than the ball. I ask the Minister whether or not he agrees, in the light of his reference to the Reuters report, that it is certainly in one sense a yawn because the markets had already to a degree anticipated that the Moody's report would indeed downgrade the credit rating of Australia. Does he agree that that is the reason why it is described as a yawn? Would he also agree then that that is hardly a reason for the kind of complacency now being displayed by himself and other members of the Government? Secondly, on the question of reality, to which the Minister referred in his response, does the Minister consider it real or unreal for the Government to take a position which forbids the pilots to get back around the negotiating table with the airlines, having in mind the full knowledge that that is the only way in the end in which this matter will be settled?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second part of the question indicates the ongoing confusion which is apparent in the Opposition with Senator Lewis's notice of motion on behalf of Senator Chaney to reintroduce the Industrial Relations (Directions to Stop Industrial Action) Amendment Bill 1989. When the pilots are outside the system Senator Chaney comes in here twice and says that we should increase the penalties under the system. That concept is inherent in the attitude of the Opposition. There is no question of the Government forbidding the pilots from talking to their employers. What a lot of rubbish! What a piece of misinformation put forward in the form of a supplementary question that is!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without going into great detail in respect of the Moody's rating issue, let me refer Senator Stone to an article in the Australian Financial Review today which discusses this issue. It makes the point that Moody's does not even seem to know what it is rating. It is being asked to rate sovereign debt. If Senator Stone wants a lengthy explanation of sovereign debt in this country, I will give it to him or to some of his satellites to whom he can give a question to ask the Government. As to the suggestion that I am playing the man rather than the ball in answering this question as I did, I ask what Senator Stone's question concerning the Prime Minister was about. Senator Stone is not in some academic drinking club here; he is in the kitchen. He asked his question as a question in the kitchen, if not in the gutter. He got the answer which he deserved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty with Senator Archer's comment is that he shows no concern that the number of African elephants has gone down from 1.2 million in 1981 to 600,000 now. That is a matter of no concern to Senator Archer but one of considerable concern to people all around the world. In the environment statement the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australia will be actively seeking a prohibition of trade in ivory, except for antique ivory, at the next convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna (CITES).</PARA>
<PARA>The next meeting of CITES will be in October of this year. Australia will vigorously support proposals to transfer the African elephant to appendix 1 of that treaty. The reason for that is that we need to act quickly to try to stamp out the illegal trade in ivory, which unfortunately is allowed to go on by so many countries and has meant that the poaching of those elephants has increased. The Prime Minister has recently written to the President of Kenya to congratulate him on his courageous action in destroying a very valuable collection of ivory as a gesture to show the world how seriously Kenya regards the problem. On 22 August this year the Prime Minister went further and announced that an immediate ban would be placed on the importation of ivory and other elephant products into Australia. That was done to show, in advance of the October meeting, that Australia means business. That announcement will be implemented by transferring the African elephant from schedule 2 to schedule 1 in the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. Importers and all those concerned will be informed immediately.</PARA>

References to mustard gas experiments involving Australian ex-servicemen have been made in the Parliament as far back as 1975, in the press in 1981, 1987 and now, again, in 1989. In 1975, the then Minister for Defence, in response to a question without notice, confirmed that these experiments had been undertaken and that they were documented in the official war history, published in 1958. The then Minister also informed the House that volunteers were eligible to claim for compensation under the Repatriation Act. Eligible veterans have been entitled to compensation by way of the disability pension since 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no inconsistency. I would like to take this opportunity to detail the most up to date figures in relation to equal employment opportunity (EEO) in the Australian Public Service (APS). There are 92 agencies covered by the EEO provisions of the Public Service Act and they are required to report to the Public Service Commissioner on their programs. At this stage all APS departments have lodged an EEO program. Six smaller agencies that were due to lodge their first EEO programs in 1988 or 1989 have not yet done so. Two new agencies are not yet due to report. The representation of women at senior levels in the Australian Public Service has increased significantly since the introduction of our EEO program in 1984. In June 1983, there were only 34 women in the Senior Executive Service (SES). By July this year, there were 145. Women's proportional representation at this level has risen from 2.5 per cent to 9.3 per cent. At the top level of the administrative service officer structure, ASO class 8, the representation of women has risen from about 6 per cent at the end of 1983 to over 13 per cent in December 1988. Results from recent intakes to senior levels are even more encouraging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988-89 about 15 per cent of all promotions to SES vacancies and 18 per cent of promotions to levels 1 and 2 were women. In fact, the percentages of women promoted in recent years at both the middle and senior management levels are similar to those for men with comparable levels of education.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that obviously there is still a great deal of room for improvement. I have said in this place-and it has been said by members of the Opposition and by Senator Giles and Senator Crowley-that there is obviously a great deal more to be done in regard to the Public Service. However, I think those figures clearly indicate that pro- gress is being made. As far as the Government is concerned, it can certainly say to the private sector, `We have made some significant progress. We want to do better and we are committed to doing so'.</PARA>

Unfortunately, Senator Newman's contribution last week simply tended to demonstrate that terrible ignorance. Funding for sport is the only real way in which one judges governments' contributions. Funding for sport under the Fraser Government went up by an average of 1.7 per cent a year. Under the Hawke Government it has gone up 7.3 per cent a year. That is the only way one can compare it. Those opposite gave it nothing; we have given it a chance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we look further at what was announced last week, to demonstrate the level of Senator Newman's ignorance I think one could say that the program was devoted very much to improving the health and lifestyles of Australians, with a particular emphasis for women. That obviously is something that Senator Newman missed. First off, the Aussie sports program, which has been phenomenally successful in getting children-that is, boys and girls-to participate in sport, now takes place in thousands of Australian schools. Funding for that has been doubled. That enables girls to play sports they had never otherwise contemplated participating in, because there are modified rules and boys and girls can get in there together. That has been, I think, one of the initiatives of the last three or four years that has really been worth while.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the great problems with health and with lifestyles is that adolescent girls, in particular, have been dropping out of sport. The surveys on that in the last few years are quite alarming. To assist in ending that the Government also announced that it was spending almost $2m this year on a program of sports leadership for young people to make sure that in the secondary schools we can train leaders to help with primary school and secondary school children to try to make sure that that participation rate can be kept up. Further to that, we have doubled funding for the women's sport promotion unit. Again, by doubling the funding for that body, which has got a phenomenally successful record in its short life so far, we can further direct our activities to ending that alarming drop-out rate of adolescent girls and, hopefully, we can encourage them to stay in longer.</PARA>
<PARA> Even when one looks at the elite programs, once again Senator Newman has missed the point. She missed the point that under the elite program women are benefiting just as much as men. In fact, it is interesting to note when one looks right through the range of sports, not just at the Australian Institute of Sport but also national sporting organisations, then a whole range of women's sports are going to benefit from the $8.5m.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point that Senator Newman missed, of course, is that there is no harm at all-I have just been handed a note which says that Mike Ahern won 26-21. Thank you very much, Senator Tate. Bad luck, Ron. If I could just continue, Mr President: I have nothing against helping people to kick balls, either women or men. In fact, a considerable amount of that money will be spent on helping people kicking balls-but not only on that. It will help them to throw javelins; it will help them to swing racquets; it will help them in a whole range of sports. The sum of $100m in four years is going to do a great deal for Australian sport-much more than some of the silly remarks of Senator Newman.</PARA>

This is not of particular concern, I would have thought, given that I have a responsibility to ensure that the payments are made and that the grants are in accordance with the agreed principles.

So one could argue that I took five days to satisfy myself that the grant recommendations from the Northern Territory were in order in terms of principles agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must admit-and I am happy to put this on the record-that I did have some concerns, some reservations, about the recommendations that Mr McCarthy made. I was concerned about the degree to which horizontal equalisation was being implemented in line with the principles that had been agreed to. However, I sought to have an investigation to reassure myself, through officers of my Department. I have made the decision to accept the recommendations on these grounds: First of all, I am very well aware that further delay would have disadvantaged councils in the Northern Territory, and I was not wanting to do that, or course. Furthermore, I must admit that the Territory, through officers, has agreed to have further discussions with the Federal Government over the methodology that it is employing in relation to the allocation of these grants. This is particularly to ensure that there is an appropriate balance in terms of the resources going to municipal and non-municipal councils, particularly the impact on Aboriginal councils. I am sure, given the lengthy speeches that Senator Tambling has made in this place allegedly on behalf of the Aboriginal people, that he would be concerned that we get the correct balance in meeting the needs of Aboriginal or non-municipal councils.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I have made the decision because next year the legislation under which financial assistance grants are administered comes up for review. I will then be reviewing not only how the principles are operating in the Northern Territory but also how they are operating generally, and ensuring that a more equitable system of distribution is instituted around Australia. For those reasons I believe that the five-day actual delay was justified.

Overall, family service grants-which include grants for marriage counselling, marriage education, family mediation and the new programs for youth mediation and family therapy-have increased by 26.3%. I note that there has already been a favourable public reaction to the youth mediation and family therapy initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>The high commitment of this Government to programs which directly assist the family is shown in the magnitude of increases which the Government has consistently been prepared to make in this area of funding, including in times of great financial restraint. Over the seven budgets since my Government has been in office there has been a real increase of over 70% in family service grants. This compares with a 4% increase over the seven budgets of the Fraser Government.</PARA>

<PARA>DIRECT TALKS BEST WAY TO END PILOTS' ROW</PARA>
<PARA>Sir, I can assure Pamela Williams that I have not ``recanted'' on the coalition's industrial relations policy in the context of the pilots' dispute as she suggests in her quite extraordinary article in your newspaper (AFR, August 28) under the heading ``Industrial relations perspective''. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say I often wonder about Ms Williams' perspective but today's effort sets new standards. There are a number of mis-statements and factual inaccuracies requiring correction. </PARA>
<PARA> First, she wrongly implies that it is my preference for the airlines and the pilots to resolve the dispute before the Industrial Relations Commission. Quite the reverse is true. </PARA>
<PARA> It is central to our policy, and to my own approach, that the best way to conduct industrial relations in this country is for direct employer-employee negotiation at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this, I said only yesterday on the Face to Face programme that I saw two courses available in the current dispute. The first was for sensible direct discussion on what could be done to improve productivity to form a basis for a proper wage rise for the pilots. This I described as the constructive option. </PARA>
<PARA> I went on to say that if that was not acceptable to the parties then, and only then, you would need to look to effective arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> That's where our proposal to give the commission some real power to enforce its decisions and directions, as spelt out in paragraph 5.5 of the policy document, comes into play. </PARA>
<PARA> If you have a situation where voluntary agreement is not possible, then the commission must have some powers to ensure that, if a matter is brought to it, there is some real prospect of its decisions being accepted by all parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Ms Williams is woefully incorrect in asserting that existing sanctions are effective. She particularly refers to the bans clause procedure as an option available to the airlines in this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech to Parliament in May 1987, Ralph Willis, then Minister for Industrial Relations, said the existing bans clause provisions ``have long since fallen into disrepute and are now substantially moribund . . .''. His attempt to insert new procedures failed when Simon Crean said in August of that year that the ACTU would not accept any change to the compliance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the existing procedures do not work was dramatically illustrated in the plumbers and gasfitters dispute, a dispute referred to by Ms Williams. She is absolutely wrong in linking action in the Federal Court in this matter with the bans clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it was only after months of getting nowhere using the bans clause ``remedy'' that employers decided to proceed under Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. That's what led to the fines mentioned by Ms Williams. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that a person of her experience should have so mis-stated the facts of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is of the essence in industrial disputes. That's why employers have resorted to the Common Law and Section 45D. We fully endorse those tactics. </PARA>
<PARA> Our proposal is simply to add to the weapons available by changing the industrial relations legislation to allow immediate access to the Federal Court when directions are defied. Had these provisions applied when the pilots first began their industrial action a few weeks ago, the situation would never have deteriorated as it has. </PARA>
<PARA> Ms Williams is also wrong when she says this proposal would have no effect on the pilot's dispute because the pilots ``are no longer in the system''. The mere cancellation of the award does not place the pilots outside the jurisdiction of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is just silly to imply we do not support the airlines in their use of civil remedies or their attempts to negotiate contracts on the basis of productivity improvements. Nor are we ``urging them to settle the dispute back in the Industrial Relations Commission''. As I said earlier, our preferred way out of the dispute is for direct and constructive negotiations between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the airlines and many other employers have been prevented or discouraged from moving in this direction because of the inflexible and failed Accord between the Government and the ACTU. The Accord and the centralised system have proved incapable of accommodating employers and employees who can demonstrate mutual benefits from changes in work practices linked to improved pay and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, and Ms Williams' contacts at the ACTU, bear a heavy for the disruption now occurring and the reduced living standards of most Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clear implication in Senator Parer's question was that under no circumstances would I, at any time, countenance the use of common law actions to resolve industrial disputes. He quoted part of my speech to the effect that `the worst possible thing is to drag people into the courts in an attempt to resolve industrial disputes'. The clear inference is that I do not favour the use of common law actions to resolve industrial disputes under any circumstances. I refer the Senate to a later part of my speech in which I clearly indicated that common law actions did have a place in the industrial relations system but that they would be an avenue of last resort in the resolution of any dispute. At that stage, I think I indicated that the Mudginberri dispute may have had something to do with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard that editorial and that reply, as I believe they touch upon matters which will be considered by the Privileges Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>EDITORIAL OPINION</PARA>
<PARA>Friday, August 18, 1989</PARA>
<PARA>State safety comes first</PARA>
<PARA> South Australians have a right to know if safety is endangered by nuclear ship visits. A State representative, Senator Baden Teague, seems to think otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade, of which he is a member, produced a report recommending that nuclear ships be banned from Port Adelaide until safety could be established. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that the report is based on outdated information, and is unacceptable to the Government; but its thrust is a matter of public concern here, and The Advertiser published relevant findings. </PARA>
<PARA> Following our publication, the report was tabled in the Senate, and the President, Senator Sibraa, accepted Senator Teague's argument that the privileges committee should investigate whether there had been an unauthorised disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, a monumental hypocrisy involved: politicians will leak furiously to the media when it suits their purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> And if there is any breach of parliamentary privilege it is surely to be found in the committee members or whoever released the information-not in the press which published that information in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> However, our real concern is not the games Senator Teague wants to play but the safety of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> We look, then, to the State Government. And what do we find? Marine Minister Bob Gregory admits he hasn't actually investigated the matter but, yes, the Government would be ``reluctant'' to allow into Port Adelaide ships which were nuclear powered or carrying nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> This is head in sand. In principle, there is no reason to retreat from the official Australian position that hosting warships from Britain and the United States is part of our defence alliance. We do not ask whether they are nuclear powered or carry nuclear warheads. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, however, we saw the apathy of the State Government in an emergency services exercise which showed there were no credible plans for coping with any nuclear emergency at the Port. </PARA>
<PARA> We have yet to be convinced that such plans are now properly in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate committee should be thanked for raising the matter; but, while it now seems to have become something of a game to the Canberra politicians, the citizens of South Australia will be getting on with demanding some action for their safety. </PARA>
<PARA>The Adelaide Advertiser, Wednesday, 23 August 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Letter to the Editor</PARA>
<PARA>Courtesy and respect</PARA>
<PARA>In the editorial (The Advertiser, 18/8/89) you have the gall to accuse me of hypocrisy and indirectly of being secretive and irresponsible as well. None of the charges is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I am an active member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and closely pursued our inquiry into visits to our ports by nuclear-powered ships. </PARA>
<PARA> Our 640-page report is now published and it is the most thorough inquiry of its kind ever undertaken. I support all 39 of our recommendations including our call for all safety plans to be publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the thrust of your editorial (like Don Quixote, single-handedly protecting South Australian citizenry) I should point out that no nuclear-powered ship has ever visited South Australia and no visit is planned.</PARA>
<PARA> Our recommendation with regard to the safety plan already in place for ship visits to Port Adelaide is solely that recent land-use developments in the vicinity of the Port be specifically reassessed to ensure the safety plan is operating as intended. </PARA>
<PARA> As for my motive to refer to the Senate Privileges Committee a clearly unusual and serious breach of Parliament's standing orders, I make no apology. The motion is of concern to all senators and was adopted without dissent. </PARA>
<PARA> Courtesy and respect are still to be expected of the press. I am a member of the Privileges Committee set up to protect the rights of citizens to give submissions to Parliament and the right of the Parliament to consider matters and publish findings in an unfettered and responsible way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me go right to the heart of the problem by drawing atention to words that have been used by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I would like to take the Senate back to the Qantas Airways Ltd pilots dispute in August 1974 when Mr Hawke was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). A report in the Sun-News Pictorial of 30 August 1974 said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a unanimous decision that covered Right-wingers, Left-wingers, and Mr Hawke, the ACTU executive has warned off ministers who try to interfere in the legitimate industrial processes of negotiations, conciliation and arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA> This decision was aimed at both Mr Cameron and the Transport Minister, Mr Jones, who told Qantas to withdraw its offer of 27 per cent to the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>The next day Mr Hawke announced in a press release that he would `try to get the executive to endorse the principle that the Government should not interfere in negotiated agreements and should not intervene in arbitration cases to oppose claims for improved pay and conditions'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as Senator Collins says, that is what the unions are saying now. But this Prime Minister cannot resist getting his cotton-picking fingers into it. What he has done is exacerbate the dispute. He has poured petrol on the fire and created an enormous economic problem for this country. I will come to that point in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1977, when the Liberal-National Party Government ordered Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hercules aircraft to provide an emergency passenger and freight air service to Tasmania during a domestic pilots strike, the then President of the ACTU, Mr Hawke, warned that the use of servicemen would be regarded as strike-breaking and could provoke an all-out confrontation between the unions and the Government. So, again, in 1977 he was criticising the very actions that he has taken today. Let us look at the answers given in the Senate today in relation to this matter. Senator Button said that he agrees with something which Mr Hawke said in July 1986 in relation to the Mudginberri dispute. Mr Hawke then said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't believe that better industrial relations are brought about by the method of harsh legal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Button said he approved of today. What did the Prime Minister say nine days ago? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I say without equivocation that when the airlines decide to initiate those legal processes with significant very drastic financial penalties against individual pilots and their organisation, the airlines will be pursuing those legal processes with the full support of my Government. </PARA>
<PARA>On many previous occasions the Prime Minister has made statements about politicians, and Prime Ministers in particular, not interfering. Yet he is now interfering. We discovered from what Senator Button said today-and I believe it to be a disgraceful state of affairs-that the Government is negotiating with only one party to this dispute. The Government is not having any discussions at all with the pilots. It has not had any discussions with Mr McCarthy. It has taken to its bosom Sir Peter Abeles and Ansett Airlines of Australia. The Government is not prepared to try to bring about some proper negotiation which might bring this matter to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber have no brief for the pilots. We do not approve of what the pilots have done. But we do say that if the Government is going to interfere in any way in this matter, it should be trying to bring both parties to the negotiating table. It should be trying to get the pilots to accept that some sort of productivity agreement should be negotiated and that any salary increase should be granted on the basis of a proper and adequate consideration of current productivity, which Senator Button bucketed today. He has said that the pilots of Australia are not achieving proper productivity. I do not know whether they are. However, from what Senator Button said, clearly there must be room for productivity negotiations which might bring this dispute to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> This dispute demonstrates beyond any shadow of doubt that the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy and the accord have failed both ordinary Australians and the Australian economy. The pilots dispute is a direct result of Labor's mismanagement of the economy and industrial relations. As I said, it has been exacerbated by the Prime Minister's inflammatory language. The dispute is the direct result of the failure of two centralised regulatory systems, both of which have failed to take into account economic reality and human behaviour. Under the centralised wage system, decisions are handed down about how much people should be paid without their true worth being known. That is the first system that is wrong. The second is the regulated price fixation system of the current airlines monopoly which means that there is no competition in the industry and that the costs are simply passed on to the consumer. In that sort of circumstance the result that we are faced with here today is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has resulted in a massive exodus of skilled workers from the system. It has created shortages. For example, Qantas is no longer able to carry out the maintenance of its aircraft because the skilled workers have left the system. That is a direct result of the accord. Both graduates and skilled tradesmen have departed from traditional employment. They have got out of the system; they have run away from the accord. I see that Senator Collins is looking at me. I say to him that when I was inspecting a factory recently I came across a very skilled young man who was repairing computers. I praised him and made some comments about the skills that he must have. He said to me, `Senator, can you tell me why my mate who is a brickie's labourer is getting more money than I am?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not the slightest doubt that people are seeking all sorts of ways to avoid the accord. They are setting up their own consultancies and providing the same sort of service outside the system. The pilots dispute is simply one example of a group of people breaking out from the centralised wage system, a system which grants across the board increases irrespective of the needs of the employers and employees at the workface. Today Senator Button was critical of our policy. I say that such break-outs as this wage break-out can occur only in the Government's rigid centralised system. They would not happen under a coalition policy. They would not happen under a coalition policy. They just simply would not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If our policies had been in place, if we had been elected in 1987, the pilots of Australia would not be in this position: they would either have remained in the industrial relations system with the effective enforcement provisions as outlined in the Bill which Senator Chaney introduced last week, and of which I gave notice this morning; or they would have negotiated a private agreement either on an individual basis, through a union or on some workplace basis which is binding on both parties and which would be enforceable by both parties. There would have been no wage break-out because we would not be worried, as is the Government because of the accord, of the flow-on. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what is worrying the Prime Minister. He recognises that under this stupid system the Government has established, if the pilots get a wage break-out it will flow right through the system. It will cause enormous economic havoc if the pilots get their wage increase under the Government's centralised system. It would not apply under our system. The Prime Minister's intervention and over-reaction has been thoroughly inept and he has simply inflamed the dispute to such a stage that, I might say, I believe his intervention has now become a major stumbling block to the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that it is quite clear also that the Prime Minister and this Government are operating under a set of double standards because there was no action by this Government when the waterside workers closed down the port of Melbourne for nearly a week. There was no action at all; we did not hear the Prime Minister jumping up and down and being Rambo about the waterside workers down in Port Melbourne. Nor did we hear the Government doing anything about it when the meat workers union imposed rolling bans and stoppages in pursuit of pay claims outside the wage principles. Of course they are outside the wage principles. If they do not get it one way they will have to get it another way. The pilots are demonstrating just one way of getting what they want outside the wage principles. When the Government opposed Senator Chaney's Bill recently what did Senator Aulich say in here? He is trying to justify himself today-incorrectly. I happen to have his speech, and it is quite clear that Senator Aulich was not at that stage in the debate last week saying what he said today.

<PARA>the worst possible thing to do to improve industrial relations in this country is to get people into the courts and the common law system. That is the worst possible way for people to go if, first, we are going to solve industrial disputes on the whole or, second, we are going to create a climate of industrial relations harmony that helps us as a country to maintain a reasonable reputation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Aulich said during the debate here the week before last and yet the Prime Minister says, `That is exactly the way I am going to go'. Of course this hypocritical Prime Minister is in fact adopting our policies but he is trying to impose them upon a centralised wage system and they will not work in a centralised wage system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government should immediately move to free up the industrial relations system. Senator Button said it in the course of an answer today when he said, `Of course there should be a more flexible system. There should not be wage rigidities. There should be a flexible wage system. There should be flexibilities in the industrial relations system'. Of course he knows the position. That is why I interjected, `Yes and in due course your Government will adopt-if you're here long enough-our flexible wage system. You will find some way of endeavouring to free up this system because it is too rigid and it is in effect deskilling this nation'. As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, he should swallow his pride and withdraw from this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening as a result of this dispute. Let us look at the tourism and hotel industries and see what is happening in those industries. The tourist industry is estimating known losses of $20m per day and a total cost estimated so far at about $600m already. We can see from the attitude of the pilots that this dispute will go on for a very long period of time. The Gold Coast is now in the peak of its tourist season. One-third of the tourists to the Gold Coast are air travellers. There have been 7,000 cancellations of conventions or groups recorded so far. Last Friday 2,200 delegates were lost from the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA> The average loss of business on the Gold Coast currently is $2.5m per day in the 5-star hotel occupancy where the rates are estimated to be as low as 13 per cent in the peak of their season. We know that in the capital cities-Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne -the figures are down for the hotel bookings. We know that the restaurants are suffering losses in Cairns; we have had reports of immediate cancellations of groups and conventions costing $2m and more coming in daily and costs of this order are being repeated in every State, with flow-ons to restaurants and the food industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins is saying it is catastrophic in the Northern Territory. The damage to the economy is immeasurable because it will go on. The damage to the economy will go on for a long period. Of course there is a possibility that the bottom might fall out of the Australian dollar under this Government if it stays here much longer and then, of course, overseas tourism might come good again. If that is Senator Button's policy, believe me, Mr Acting Deputy President, we do not approve of that policy. But that looks to be the only chance for tourism under him because it will be years-three to five years; and I see Senator Collins agrees-before the tourism industry recovers from this disastrous strike. It is front page news in Japanese newspapers and I understand that some 25 Japanese tour operators have cancelled tours in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another matter of grave concern, and that is the political pressure which we believe was imposed on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to grant immediate operational approval for a DC8-62 aircraft owned by Arrow Air Inc. to operate on a charter basis for freight flights in Australia. Australia's aviation safety record is at risk in relation to this matter. Normally it takes three months for CAA to grant operational approval for an aircraft. It has done this in a couple of days and we understand that is because it has been leaned on by someone in the Government. Arrow Air Inc., which is providing this aircraft, does not have an operational manual for Australia and it does not have an enviable safety record. I alert Senator Button and others in the chamber to that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has repeatedly said that the accord is the cornerstone of its economic policies. Well, the accord has failed; the Government's economic policies have failed. Look at the Moody's report today. We have net foreign debt of $108 billion. We have a current account deficit estimated to be over $20 billion this year. The Budget is predicting inflation at 7 1/2 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is telling us that the high interest rates will go on for another two or three years. There is Moody's attack on not only the Government's credit rating, but also on all of these institutions in Australia today. Let there be not the slightest doubt that this Government's economic policies have failed. The accord has failed. The Government has failed and it is time it went. </PARA>

That is an article of faith with Senator Lewis. It is not an article based on any particular rational argument. He has got to try to establish that. Of course, his speech was directed towards solving the problems of many years of industrial relations in Australia. As he has done in previous speeches, he comes back to this chatty little conversation he had with a young man working on computers in a factory he once visited. We have all heard that story before. That young man asked him, `Why is my mate who is a bricklayer getting more than I am?'. There might be very obvious answers to that question, including the very high demand in the building industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us deal with it now. Senator Stone said that the Government should get out of the way in this dispute, a view firmly supported by his H. R. Nicholls Society mate, Mr Des Moore, who said that putting extra powers into the hands of the Industrial Relations Commission-which is what the Opposition is going to support here this week-is not the answer. He suggested that the Opposition should support the right of pilots to negotiate directly with their employers. That is what Senator Stone's friend from the H. R. Nicholls Society said. On the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, had this to say on 22 August:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The pilots and the employers could, I believe, work out a better arrangement than they've got at present. That's up to them. </PARA>
<PARA>But by today Senator Chaney, in his letter to the Australian Financial Review which Senator Lewis has tabled here today, was saying that effective arbitration is the only available option left if sensible direct discussions on what could be done to improve productivity collapses. The Opposition's spokesman on industrial relations has changed his view in one week. On the other hand, Mr Peacock, the Opposition Leader in the other place, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer-employee fight and look after the national interest. And the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>There are three spokesmen, chosen at random, contributors to the Opposition's industrial relations policy, all with different views, one of them with two different views in the space of one week. Senator Lewis then comes in here today and gives us the outstanding revelation that in 1974 Bob Hawke, who was then leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), had a different position from that which he has 15 years later in totally different circumstances.

What he came back to saying again and again was that the accord had failed compared with previous years and compared with the future under some halcyon Liberal regime and that one will see how much it has failed. The accord is there because in 1982 a Liberal government responded to exactly the same sorts of economic pressures that this Government is under by granting 16 per cent wage claims.</PARA></TALK.START>

One always hopes that Senator Stone will justify his substantial reputation as a thinker about these matters and not resort to those mindbending slogans-ACTU! ACTU! If the Senator Stone is going to be associated with the proposing of matters of public importance in the Senate which attack the Government for its wages policy, he cannot in relation to 1982 say it was not the Government's fault but the fault of the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, of the ACTU, or of somebody else. Senator Stone cannot have it both ways. He cannot be third speaker on this issue and have it both ways. It was the Government's fault in 1982 if it is the Government's fault now, as he says. He cannot have it both ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the accord failing, I make the point that real unit labour costs in this country have seen substantial reductions under the life of this Government as distinct from what happened in 1981 and 1982. There has been a generally improved performance in industrial relations and, in terms of flexibility in the wages system, which I referred to in my speech on this issue 10 days ago in the Senate, companies which have taken advantage of the agreement route provided in industrial relations legislation and reached agreements with their employees and had them ratified by the arbitration Commission are enjoying the flexibility which is inherent in the present system as a step forward towards greater flexibility. It is no good talking about that issue, of course, in relation to the airline pilots, because they decided very early on to take themselves outside the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why the pilots dispute undermines the credibility of the Opposition on this issue is that the pilots have rejected one crucial part of what I regard as the legitimate preferred approach of the Opposition; that is, the pilots do not wish to have their current 30 per cent wage claim linked to productivity increases. They will not talk about that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis has had his go-come on. The fact of the matter is that in this dispute the parties have decided to opt out of the system. The Commission cannot deal with the dispute and cannot make the directions now desired by the Opposition under the Bill which was introduced 10 days ago and about which Andrew Peacock goes around saying, `If the Government had passed that Bill it would have been all right'. That is a lot of bunkum, not surprisingly from Andrew Peacock. It is absolute rubbish that it would have been all right if we had passed that bit of legislation in the Senate. The pilots have resigned; their award has been cancelled. There can be no dispute to be settled if pilots are no longer employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What should flow from the Opposition's industrial relations policy is support for the processes followed in the pilots dispute to date. The companies acted swiftly when the dispute begun by the pilots pulled them out of the wages system. They went over the head of the union to deal directly with their own employees-a desired element, Senator Chaney has told us in many debates in this place. They went over the head of the union and dealt directly with their own employees. When this approach failed, they then resorted to court action against individual pilots. This is a model case under the Opposition's proposed industrial relations system. Instead of supporting what the airlines have done in this case, the Opposition now wants to bring the dispute back into the wages system. I am very surprised that, with the level of confusion shown by the Opposition, it wanted to debate this question here today. That is, after all, collective bargaining in action. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred already to the considerable confusion shown by various Opposition spokesmen in relation to this dispute. Senator Chaney said, `The pilots and the employers could . . . have worked out a better arrangement than they've got at present. That's up to them'. Later he changed that to say, `We want a system where they are subject to the Industrial Relations Commission and the sanctions of that Commission'. Another friend of Senator Stone, Mr McLachlan, said 10 days ago, `There should be no constraint, other than common law constraints, on these contracts'. In that case he was talking about contracts between stevedoring companies, watersiders and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots dispute is a very serious dispute. It is regrettable that the Opposition has seen it as an issue for grandstanding. As I have said in the course of debates here with Senator Lewis on a number of occasions, no government in the current economic circumstances in Australia can ignore the consequences of aggregate wage outcomes. No government can be unconcerned about claims for 30 per cent salary increases which are couched in such terms as, `We want it now and we will not discuss productivity issues in order to get it'. Quite simply, that is the way it is put by the pilots. While that frame of mind remains with one party to the industrial relations system as regards the airlines, while I hope that those clear positions can be reconciled between the airlines and the pilots on some of the issues in question, particularly the productivity one, unless they are so reconciled there is not much hope of a quick and satisfactory settlement of this dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone told me by way of interjection that the Government should keep out of this issue. We cannot keep out of it in the Senate when we have before us a matter of public importance which is designed to tell us what to do, but I think there is something to be said for that advice. Senator Lewis came in here today and made a speech as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, saying that the Government should call the parties together, should do all of these things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -We are debating today a matter of public importance brought into the Senate by Senator Lewis in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy which has led to the massive disruption caused by the airline pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly agree with one part of that and that is that massive destruction has been caused by the airline pilots dispute. It is undeniable that it has been one of the most destructive of strikes that we have seen in this country for a very long time and that the effects of this industrial action will not only be felt immediately by hundreds if not thousands of businesses around Australia, but will indeed be felt for many years to come in terms of the bankruptcy of many of those businesses and the destroyed life chances of hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians. However, I cannot agree with the notion that an industrial relations policy can actually lead to a strike. Considering the antecedents of this strike, I am old-fashioned enough to believe that it ought to be seen in terms of what normally occurs in strikes-that is, people endeavouring to increase their pay or improve their conditions of work. </PARA>
<PARA> One can point to three major items with respect to the airline pilots dispute. First, there is the worldwide shortage of experienced airline pilots and, therefore, Australian pilots see comparative wage differences between themselves and their overseas counterparts. Secondly, the pilots undoubtedly have industrial clout in a capital-intensive industry. At the moment, the airlines are losing millions of dollars a day while the cost of paying that extra 30 per cent would have amounted to about $100,000 a day. That disparity fairly obviously gives the pilots an enormous amount of clout. Thirdly, the pilots have pointed to the comparative wage justice given to Australian executives who are outside the accord and who have achieved average wage increases of 50 per cent. They have compared those people with others who have been subject to the accord. The airline pilots argue that they wish to compare themselves with Australian executives. One might argue alternatively that executives ought to be subjected to the accord rather than being outside it. Be that as it may, they are the three major points which could be said, after a dispassionate analysis, to have led to this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some discussion about the role of the accord in regard to this exercise. One has to look at its history and note that between 1983, when the accord was established, and the end of 1987 strike activity fell by 82 per cent. One would have to accept that that, in itself, has contributed millions of dollars to the Australian economy, and hence there have been gains. Likewise, comments have been made in Australia and overseas about our accord. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has seen value in the accord, as have other countries. The President of South Korea recently invited an Australian delegation to his country to discuss the accord. The South Korean economy has experienced industrial unrest and currently wage claims in the vicinity of 40 to 50 per cent are being looked at. One would have to say that South Korea is going through that problem because it started off at a very low industrial base and moved very rapidly to a very high industrial base while seeking democratisation. One of the down sides of freedom is that we permit people to strike and value their right to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition raised a number of items here today and suggested that its alternative policies would have worked whereas the current ones do not. I am not at all sure that there is a great deal of substance in that. I make exactly the same point that Senator Button made. If a group of people resigned, if they are no longer employed, no industrial policy is of any worth. If they stay within the system and strike, we can definitely compare systems. But we cannot have a system which compels people to work unless we introduce some sort of slavery. If people choose to resign from their jobs, they are using the ultimate weapon they have, although it is a pretty drastic weapon for any individual to use. Once people use that weapon, they are outside the system in toto and the industrial relations system is irrelevant from that point onwards. This dispute will not be settled under this system. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, a very good article in the Australian Financial Review by Pamela Williams raised a number of matters put forward by the Opposition. In her analysis, she made five points. She said that there had been a secret ballot before the initiation of the pilots' action. Secondly, the Opposition's policy is that people should be allowed to opt out of the system. Indeed, after the cancellation of the pilots' award, there was an opting out of the system. Thirdly, the Opposition's policy seeks direct negotiations between employer and employees. That undoubtedly is currently available and has been available to date. Fourthly, the Opposition's policy urges the use of the common law. That use is currently under way. Indeed, at the end of the day, the pilots may wish they had never heard of common law. Many tourism operators in Queensland who are losing millions of dollars a day are not likely to be bound by any resolution made by other groups and discontinue their claims. Many of those tourist operations will continue with their lawsuits willy-nilly. I am not sure that the pilots knew what they were letting themselves in for in that respect. Fifthly, the Opposition's policy talks about wage gains being achieved for productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of that analysis, one might say that the dispute has followed the essential lines set out in the Liberal and National parties' industrial relations policy. I fail to see how the Opposition's policy would have meant that the situation would have been different, unless there had been an agreement to the 30 per cent wage rise. As I do not read all the newspapers in Australia, I am unaware of the Liberal and National parties' position on the wage rise itself. However, unless the wage rise were granted, under any system we would be where we are today because the pilots were willing to push ahead and use the resignation weapon so early in the dispute. Few other groups would even dare to use that weapon because of the very difficult situation it puts the individual in, particularly those who do not have great resources. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the industrial relations atmosphere in Australia, one has to admit that in recent years some changes have not been for the best. Indeed, when the first Willis Bill was introduced in 1987 the Australian Democrats expressed their support for it. The Bill contained non-compliance provisions and retained the ability to go to common law. But it was proposed that a one-stop shop be introduced through the notion of a labour court. As a result of a very strong campaign run against that proposal by the New Right, the Labor Government backed off that Bill and introduced a much weaker Bill which was less able to deal with the types of problems we are facing today. I believe that the original Bill would have been a far better Bill to deal with the current situation. It would have been a far better Bill in terms of industrial relations, particularly as it proposed a more effective, more certain, and certainly cheaper method of operation than exists under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia could move away from the adversarial system of industrial relations, but it is unlikely to do so for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the entire political climate of this country is based on the adversarial system and that, in effect, flows through to many of the other major operating systems in this country. It is fascinating that politicians never want to take any blame for anything that happens; they want to take credit only for the good things. The political system is probably one of the things that lead to the type of industrial relations that we have in this country. Rarely, on any issue, even for the good of the country and for the benefit of the Australian population, can one get a bipartisan or tripartisan operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise that we are currently facing suggests a number of points. We need to be extremely careful when we are pushing the idea of enterprise based unions to make sure that we do not in fact take on some of the very real problems that are inherent in such an exercise. It has a great deal of merit but it also raises some problems, one of which is interesting in terms of the current dispute. I refer to the productivity debate: There are limits to the move in terms of productivity. To mention one that, obviously, I have an interest in, how might we gauge the move to productivity with regard to teachers? Are we to gauge it by more teaching hours, larger classes or better results? There are limits and one has to be careful in a service based economy, which is basically what Australia is. In a labour intensive exercise, one of the easiest ways to get an increase in productivity is to shed labour. That is very difficult to do when one is trying to keep up the labour force participation. </PARA>
<PARA> Enterprise based unions tend to encourage a more inflexible work force, with people staying within the same company structures for a long period. To use the Japanese example, at the end of the day companies then take on a much greater role in a high range of areas, such as social security and pensions. I am not sure that many employers in this country would be terribly happy with that. But they are some of the things that it seems would flow from those enterprise based structures that do not flow from the current industrial base. So one can often hypothesise about alternative systems providing us with a better exercise but in thinking through these matters one always has to point out that, unfortunately, in this area there are always downsides to every gain that we are going to get; that industrial relations is a hard slog area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one final point. If we are to compare ourselves with our foreign counterparts, as the pilots are currently doing, we have to accept the fact that Australia is no longer one of the wealthiest countries in the world and the comparative international remuneration, whether it be for car workers, teachers, pilots or judges, is simply not on any longer. It is highly likely that by the year 2000 Australia will have one of the lowest living standards in the Asian region. I think what we will be required to do is pay within the Australian context. If we are able to offer a high quality of life while we may have a lower living standard, people may very well wish to live here for that reason and accept a lower income. If they do want the higher incomes, it is probably inevitable that pilots and other skilled workers will go overseas to seek them in the international wage arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to begin by referring to a couple of remarks from the government side of the chamber this afternoon. I refer in particular to what was described as a personal explanation by Senator Aulich when he rose to his feet after Question Time to attempt to explain how he had been misrepresented in one of the questions asked from this side. Senator Aulich waxed quite eloquent. While admitting-I think he conceded it-that the quotation given by our side of the House from his speech here 10 or 11 days ago was accurate, he put the view to the Senate that it was not a complete presentation of his position and that other things that he said subsequently or in some other part of his speech, differed from that and made it plain that he was not in any way ruling out the possibility of taking industrial disputes into the courts of the land and using common law and things of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have subsequently had a look at the transcript of what Senator Aulich said that day and I have to say that, with the best will in the world I cannot find anything in his speech which conforms to what he has told us he said. Now maybe I got an inaccurate transcript, but it is in the Senate Hansard. I hope I am wrong, but it seems to me on the face of it that Senator Aulich has not been fully straightforward with us about this matter. I will leave that matter there. I have found however, by going back to look at his speech, a couple of things that he did say and is clearly on the record as having said which I would like to put on the record again. The first is the statement which was accurately quoted earlier, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must have learnt from experience, through industrial relations history, that enforced compliance with the law or with the spirit of good industrial relations is not the solution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not altogether agree with what Senator Aulich had to say at that point because there are some situations in industrial relations where compliance with the law is absolutely necessary. I refer to the simple law of contract for a start. That is why we have had some argument in recent times about the use of law of industrial tort in such cases as the Dollar Sweets and Mudginberri disputes and so on. I think section 45d of the Trade Practices Act was used in the case of Mudginberri. That is the first of Senator Aulich's comments to which I draw attention. The second comment that I would like to recall for the Senate is the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . taught us that in the end the worst possible thing to do to improve industrial relations in this country is to get people into the courts and the common law system. That is the worst possible way for people to go . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not agree with what Senator Aulich said, but the point that was being made in the question in which Senator Aulich said he was being misrepresented was that this is exactly what the Government is now saying the airline companies and, indeed, anybody else who is prepared to put up his hand and pay a good barrister for the purpose, should now be doing to the airline pilots. I personally think that is highly questionable in this case, but what Senator Aulich is doing is apparently approving it in this case, even though less than fortnight ago he said it was a stupid or very silly thing to do, or words to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> To do justice to Senator Aulich, let me pick up one other statement from his speech on that occasion when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> That box seat in most industrial disputes is generally held by the employer in the sense that employee organisations and the individual employees have nothing to negotiate with but their labour. That labour can be withdrawn: that is the only weapon they have. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come to my view of the airline pilots in a moment, but let us at least be fair enough to say that that is precisely what the airline pilots have said. They have said, `We agree with Senator Aulich. Our labour is the only thing that we can withdraw. That is the only weapon we have'. Let us be clear about what Senator Aulich's views are. I wish I could think Senator Aulich was equally clear about them. Let me also pick up a comment by Senator Button this afternoon in responding to Senator Lewis when he, I think quite shamefully, misrepresented the position of Senator Chaney. I regret that I have to say that, because I do not think Senator Button is normally guilty of that sin. He first of all quoted from something that Senator Chaney said on 22 August which suggested that the best thing was for talks to occur. Then Senator Button said that in a letter in the Australian Financial Review of 29 August Senator Chaney had said that effective arbitration was the answer. Let me just read what Senator Chaney actually said in that letter of 29 August. He was referring to his comments on the Face to Face program last Sunday. In his letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this, I said only yesterday on the Face to Face programme that I saw two courses available in the current dispute. The first was for sensible direct discussion on what could be done to improve productivity to form a basis for a proper wage rise for the pilots. This I described as the constructive option. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button did not acknowledge in any way that Senator Chaney had said that in the paragraph immediately preceding the paragraph that Senator Button proceeded to quote totally out of context in a fairly clear and, I must say deliberate, attempt to misrepresent Senator Chaney-an extraordinary effort on Senator Button's part. I am very surprised. Senator Chaney continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I went on to say that if that was not acceptable to the parties then, and only then, you would need to look to effective arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to spend further time on Senator Button's misrepresentations, but that is as gross a misrepresentation as I have come across. </PARA>

I turn to the matter of public importance itself, which is:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy which has led to the massive disruption caused by the airline pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us be quite clear: that is what the present situation is about. It is about the failure of the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy. We have got a massive overreaction from the Government because it sees that the accord is failing, is breaking down, and that, if the pilots are allowed to win, it will be the major signal-along with all the more minor ones which have already occurred-of that breakdown. No longer will the Government be able to go around the country boasting and trumpeting about its masterly economic instrument, the accord-that masterly economic instrument which has brought this Government $108 billion in foreign debt to 30 June, as announced today. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, because this Government has so much political capital-I almost said `intellectual capital', except it is a contradiction in terms as far as this Government is concerned-invested in this accord, which it now sees is breaking down, it is desperate and will do anything to stop this breakout by the pilots. It has done most things already. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), for goodness sake, intervening in this industrial dispute between the airlines and the pilots. Look at the way he has intervened. Everything he has done, everything he has said from beginning to end-not the end, because unfortunately we are not near the end of this matter, but up to this time-has been disastrous. Every personal intervention by the Prime Minister has been disastrous. We have, after all, I think most people would agree, what is certainly shaping up to be one of the worst industrial disputes in this country's history. </PARA>

I do not want to say anything at all about bus drivers, but one will not find an honest bus driver in this country who will compare himself to a pilot. That is for certain.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quite agree with Senator Collins; they have taken him at his word. I want to make it clear that the Opposition holds no particular brief for the pilots. We do not believe they are necessarily entitled to a 30 per cent salary increase. If they can show productivity gains to justify that increase, of course they will be worth it. They might be worth more than that. It is possible that they could get more than that if they went through proper productivity discussions with their employers, if the Government would get out of the way and stop protecting Bill Kelty, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the failed accord. This is something which should be determined in the end only between the pilots and their employers, and Mr Hawke has no part to play in that ring. The Opposition certainly does not support the disruption to the lives of the travelling Australian public that has been caused by this dispute. We certainly vigorously deplore the costs to tourism and other industries caused by this breakdown in industrial common sense stimulated, enforced and reinforced by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is this Government's policy, apart from bullying and threatening? Where is it going now? It has produced the situation of following the policy of the ACTU-the age-old policy of the trade union bosses in this to bluff, bluster, threaten, bully and stand over people in the belief that in the end might is right and muscle will win. Unfortunately, that has often been the case in the history of industrial relations in this country, but I put it to Government senators opposite that this time the Government may have met, in the pilots, a body of men and women who are prepared to stand up to the bluff, bluster, bullying, threatening and standover tactics of the Prime Minister and of this Government, and of the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the Prime Minister's objectives? They are to prop up the ridiculous decision of the Industrial Relations Commission a few weeks ago, and the position of Bill Kelty. I wonder who the apprentice is now. Bill Kelty used to be described as the sorcerer's apprentice-Bob Hawke's apprentice. I think it should be the other way around at the present time. The Prime Minister's objectives are to prop up the ACTU, which is losing membership and is desperately concerned about that fact. It is no accident that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is not a member of the ACTU, so the response seems to be, `Let's smash them, boys, because they have the impertinence not to join the ACTU'. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had one solution from the Prime Minister. First of all, the Royal Australian Air Force was going to carry everybody; it is carrying 2 to 3 per cent of total passengers in this country. Then the passengers were to be carried by the foreign airlines coming through this country on their normal flights. They are carrying a few people, and I am glad to see that-it is at least something-but everybody knows they are carrying only 7 to 8 per cent of total would-be passengers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Stone and Senator Lewis need a lesson in history. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots is far too professional and hard-headed a union, and has been for many years, to be in the slightest way affected by anything the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) might say or, indeed, anything said in this Parliament. The escalation of the dispute has been a matter of tit for tat on both sides, between the employers and employees, and the Opposition knows it. The reality is that there are many people in the Australian community at the moment asking why the Federation is behaving like a bunch of bloody-minded thugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two very good reasons why it is. Firstly, it has always behaved like a bunch of bloody-minded thugs and, secondly, it has always worked. The Air Pilots Federation in fact is, and always has been, the most militant white-collar union in Australia. In terms of its membership, it is also the most highly paid association in Australia. As a comment I must say that when I was researching this debate I had a look at all of the material that was available on industrial relations in the airline business, and there is very little of it about. I am indebted to the enterprise and efforts of Di Yerbury and her monograph entitled Collective Negotiations and the Airline Pilots, 1946-67 and to the particularly comprehensive work-and there is not much of it about, I can tell you-entitled Industrial Relations in the Air by Dr Nicholas Blain, a Western Australian academic and expert in industrial relations. Just to show how little things have changed, Senator Lewis, I quote from this book a statement by the then conservative Minister, the Hon. L. H. E. Bury, when he said about a former dispute:</PARA>
<PARA>For years, relationships between the Pilots' Association and later the Federation were in a pretty constant state of ferment. While many factors contributed to this unfortunate situation, one of them was the disposition of the pilots' body to exploit to the full their unique bargaining position, irrespective of the consequences for the industry and the public. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has changed. There had in fact been many disputes, strikes and regulation strikes similar to the nine to five strike in recent days in the years up to this point. The worst was the 28-day Qantas strike of 1966. The events which led to this strike began in 1958, when the Federation demanded a 28 per cent increase in domestic pilots' salaries, only a couple of per cent less than they are asking for now. In terms of further parallels with the current dispute, the airlines at that time offered a 10 per cent increase, to which the Federation did not respond, despite its failure to provide any convincing evidence to support its 28 per cent claim-also similar to the current dispute. In response to the threat of a nationwide strike, the airlines buckled and paid up. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the lasting outcomes of that agreement, which is relevant to the current dispute, was the replacement of duty rosters prepared by management with the current system of incentive bidding which still operates for Australian pilots, although in a far more beneficial way, as I will now explain, than it does for pilots in its place of origin, the United States of America. The introduction of this system as a result of the dispute led to an actual increase at the time in pilots' salaries of 35 per cent rather than the 26 per cent that had been agreed upon. The flow-on of this decision for domestic pilots to industrial action by Qantas was almost instant. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of the refusal of Qantas to comply with the demands, and with the addition of a number of issues ostensibly related to safety but widely accepted as being a front for the main agenda-money-the strike began on 25 November, lasted for 28 days and had catastrophic consequences for the airlines. Indeed, Mr President, there must be many rank and file members, a number of whom I know personally, of the Air Pilots Federation that are starting to be alarmed at the results of their bloody-minded industrial action on the whole of the Australian community, because it is starting to get very smelly indeed. I am sure that many of those people are trying to cope with this current dispute by holding their noses and thinking of money. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of this dispute I have just mentioned-it is of some interest for Opposition members perhaps to note-the then responsible Minister, Billy McMahon, even considered at one stage during the strike using the Federal Crimes Act against the pilots. The strike was finally settled by the company and the Government as usual capitulating to the demands of the Federation and the pilots then receiving salary increases of between 21 and 36 per cent. Following these two major victories, an indication of how the Federation viewed itself, and still views itself, in relation to the rest of the Australian community was provided by its then President, and indeed longest serving President, Captain R. Holt, when he welcomed the Minister for Civil Aviation, Reg Swartz, as the guest of honour to the Federation's convention in the same year as this dispute. This is what he said-and it is pretty extraordinary stuff-when he introduced the Minister as the guest of honour:</PARA>
<PARA> This Federation has an industrial strength that is unique. We can do anything that we like-we can do anything lawful that we like. </PARA>
<PARA>The political consequence of the 28-day strike was the decision by the then conservative Government to introduce legislation bringing the pilots back under jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The years that followed were marked by frequent disputes and industrial actions resulting in big advances in both pay and conditions for pilots. One of the interesting features, I might add, of the major 1974 dispute, over a claim for a 27 per cent increase on that occasion, was the ban that was imposed by the Federation on flights to Canberra and the threatened selective ban on carrying on any aircraft any Labor members of parliament. The Federation stated that the ban would be lifted only if the Prime Minister sacked both the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Transport. The arrogance of these people really knows no bounds, and nothing has changed. The pilots, among other things, claimed that these Ministers had referred to the pilots as `bloody bushrangers', `greedy bastards' and `elitist fat cats'. Well, nothing has changed there either. The reason I mention this, Mr Deputy President, is that it is very reminiscent of the quite extraordinary statements made recently by the President of the Federation, Brian McCarthy, that the Prime Minister should stay out of the dispute. </PARA>

The pilots have so far crippled this country's entire civil aviation industry, are destroying the country's biggest export earner, its tourist industry, are directly threatening the jobs of 20,000 of their fellow workers in the aviation industry, and are sending thousands of other Australians on a fraction of their pay and conditions to the wall-and they instruct the Prime Minister of Australia, in the face of all of that, that this dispute has got nothing to do with him. The arrogance of these blokes really does know no bounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two constants, in fact, that I have discovered in all of the industrial action pursued by the Federation over the years were that the Federation never hesitated to behave like thugs and always went for double figures. As Blain's book noted, one of the crucial factors in the negotiating stance, so-called, of the Federation was its insistence, on all occasions, that its salary demands be met virtually in full. It was able to achieve this by ruthlessly exploiting the fact that pilots were almost irreplaceable in the short term, and still are, because of the technological stranglehold they have on the airlines by being able to bring their operations to an instant halt with the massive financial consequences to the airlines if they do not instantly comply with their demands. The pilots have been very successful indeed in the years since in bringing about a situation which those opposite are all cheerfully ignoring in terms of the references to their being able to go overseas and compete on the international marketplace-as a result of this industrial action and this unique position, they have successfully negotiated the most beneficial system of pay and conditions for pilots in the world. If those opposite do not believe me, believe the Federation. I seek leave to table, for the benefit of honourable senators, an advice sent out by the Federation in 1988 advising its members that this is precisely the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, time does not allow me to give the Federation the attention it so richly deserves, but I would like to conclude by talking about the proposed solution to this problem by the Opposition, as advanced by Senator Chaney: wave a wand, introduce amendments that will give sanctions to the conciliation Commission, and that will fix the dispute. The reality is that that approach leaves an impression that the law as a whole is inadequate and in need of reform, but those opposite have not actually stated that this is their view and they have not actually stated-and I have had a careful look at everything that has been said-that it will solve the airline pilots dispute. In all the interviews that Senator Chaney has given this is the impression that he has created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present, the Opposition is saying that the amendments to the Act proposed will extend the power of the Commission to deal with the matter. Let us look at what is currently available. In terms of invoking sanctions, the Commission currently has available the following options: sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act, which deal with secondary and primary boycotts; the so-called common law industrial torts that permit actions for damages; sections 30j and 30k of the Crimes Act 1914, which deal with serious industrial disturbances interfering with interstate and overseas trade and commerce-which were the sections that Billy McMahon was going to use against the pilots; the bans clause procedures under sections 125 and 181 to 186 of the Industrial Relations Act; cancellation or suspension of awards under section 187; deregistration under section 294; under a new provision inserted in the 1988 Act the Commission may also refuse to deal with a matter raised by an organisation in breach of an award or direction of the Commission; and the discretionary power of the Commission to withhold national wage increases from parties which breach or fail to give `no extra claims' commitments under the wage fixing principles. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a pretty hefty range of sanctions. It should also be mentioned that the present law in Australia is tougher than the legislation enacted throughout all of the years of the Thatcher Government in the United Kingdom, where unions which gain majority support for industrial action in a secret ballot held prior to taking such action have limited immunity from common law actions. Moreover, in the United Kingdom the size of the fines for industrial action is subject to a statutory limitation. Common law action in Australia is not subject to any such statutory limits. Given this array of sanctions, Senator Chaney has been impelled to argue that the sanctions available to the Commission under the Industrial Relations Act are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> But does this really matter? Clearly, from the point of view of fines and statutory penalties, in the current dispute it matters very little whether they are contained in the Industrial Relations Act or the Trade Practices Act. Actions for enforcement of such penalties, because of the separation of powers doctrine, must ultimately be brought through the Federal Court. The Commission has no power to enforce directly its own decisions other than through denying parties access to it, and it is beyond this Parliament's power-it is about time someone said it-short of a referendum changing the Constitution, to change this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, it is entirely a matter between the employers and their now ex-employees as to how they respectively go about enforcing or limiting common law rights and duties. The sorts of damages to which Senator Stone referred that in the past have been awarded against unions would appear to represent a sufficient deterrent to any form of industrial action. Likewise breaches of section 45D (1A) of the Trade Practices Act, which deals specifically with primary boycotts affecting interstate trade, would leave individual pilots open to fines of $50,000 and their union to fines of $250,000 for each separate offence. If the courts were to impose an injunction which was ignored by the pilots, the pilots or the union might also be liable for fines for contempt of court. The Opposition amendments are totally ineffective as a means of resolving this current dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have the time I will correct an article written by Pamela Williams in the Australian Financial Review yesterday about the sanctions proposed by the Opposition. It states that they:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will have no effect whatever in the. . . dispute as the pilots are no longer in the system. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not strictly correct. Because of past disputes involving the pilots, the Commission has a special or extended jurisdiction to deal with disputes in the airline industry.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I once again refer to the policy section in Blain's book. It might be relevant to everyone, including the pilots, to read it. Written in 1984, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots' resort to militant action, especially in the period 1957 to 1966, demonstrates their ability to inflict heavy economic penalties on their employers. The 1966 28 day Qantas strike is the most obvious example. A shorter strike may well have produced similar gains for the pilots; the more restrained use of the strike since 1966 has shown that pilots can still make substantial gains by limiting the duration of their strikes. Even though it is 16 years since it occurred, the 28 day Qantas strikes should serve as a salient reminder to present day pilots both that strikes should not be unnecessarily prolonged and that arbitration can always be used as a final step in dispute settlement. This reminder is particularly timely in the light of the imminent introduction of new generation aircraft by the domestic carriers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of this matter of public importance before the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy which has led to the massive disruption caused by the airline pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Stone said, Australia is suffering under one of the most grievous industrial disputes in our history-a dispute which shows no sign of ending, which is running at enormous cost with the nation bleeding to death. Not one Australian Labor Party senator or Australian Democrat senator has made one constructive suggestion as to how this disaster can be remedied. It is a disaster which is the consequence of the policies of those who sit on the Government benches. It is customary at this time in a debate to deal with the points raised by the speakers with the opposing point of view. Unfortunately, there has been no such contribution for me to debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone expressed surprise at the dissembling that came from Senator Button. I am not surprised because I have been here a lot longer than Senator Stone has. If there is one person in this place who distorts and deflects the truth, it is Senator Button. Today Senator Button-and in a lesser way Senator Collins-did in misrepresenting what Senator Chaney and other Opposition speakers have said about industrial relations policy is just par for the course. It is crucial that Government senators do that because one Achilles heel of this Government is its archaic industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows that the Opposition has a workable and practical industrial relations policy; it knows the Australian community is tired of strikes, tired of the effect of those strikes on our standard of living. The community is tired of seeing in report after report that the nearest comparable Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country to Australia has 2 1/2 times fewer strikes than we have. Countries like Japan and Germany have about one-fiftieth of the strikes that we have. So it is absolutely crucial to the Labor Party that our position on industrial relations be debased, ridiculed and misrepresented. If the Government does not destroy that position it knows that the public will accept our policy at the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four points I wish to touch on briefly. First of all I want to go to the heart of the problem-the reason for the strike-which is simply the Labor Party's system of an inflexible and inappropriate centralised wage fixing. Secondly I want to talk about the consequences of the strike-the tragic consequences for Australia, the huge debt position we are in, the way that this debt is accelerating and the way that this strike is lighting the powder fuse under that debt. Thirdly I will specify what needs to be done. Finally I want to spend a little bit of time on the Government's actions-the way a Labor Government has acted as strike breakers in this dispute by using the Royal Australian Air Force, by using the charter operators of Australia, by allowing overseas operators to come in and break the strike. That is something that goes to the very heart of the Labor Party ethos and that the Government, in its hypocrisy, is quite happy to do. I want to talk too about the double standards adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Government in the way they have handled this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, let us look at the heart of the problem. The reason for the problem is simply that we are stuck with the great socialist dream: the belief of the Labor Party that it can control a national economy; the belief that it can dot every i and cross every t, and control and manage every aspect of the huge variations that exist in the economy. It is a great socialist dream that the Government can control all of this. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord is a total failure-a failure that has cost Australia, as Senator Stone said, a debt position of $125 billion to $130 billion, depending on how we calculate the exchange rate. The accord fails because it is a centralised wage controlling system. The Labor Party is forced to support the accord because it is supporting the dinosaurs of a trade union movement which is going out of business fast. Its membership is falling. I think its national membership figures for the work force are 32 to 35 per cent. Some decades ago the figure was well over 50 per cent. The Australian Labor Party is the parliamentary arm of the trade union movement. So it is vitally important that the ex-union secretaries and the schoolteachers here representing the Labor Party must reflect in their policies support for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which wants the accord held because it is central to maintaining the place of the ACTU in Australia and preserving this archaic union structure which is dragging down our standard of living day by day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party and the National Party offer an alternative. We know there is a better way and the Australian people know there is a better way. They know that we ought to have voluntary unionism. If people want to join a union that is their civil right. But unions should not have any power to coerce people to join unions. They should not have any power to set up closed shops. We also believe that the unions should not be craft based. They should be enterprise based, so that the survival of the whole enterprise is directly related to the individual efforts of those people involved, a process of cause and effect. But the Labor Party is stuck with this inflexible, archaic system.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of the present system, and what Senator Collins is terrified of, is the flow-on effect. Under the present rigid system, if someone somewhere gets a wage rise, the rest of the union members must get it and the people in other unions must get it. So the whole of the Australian economy becomes inflated, irrespective of the ability of an industry or an employer to pay. Obviously, the system is unworkable. The Labor Party knows this. We have seen spurious productivity gains in the last few years under the accord. Productivity has not gone up at all; it has only been fiddled by the Labor Party, which has used the excuse of productivity awards to grant wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as maintaining the fixed 6 per cent wage rise, unions have indulged in deceitful, covert activities. Site allowances for the Builders Labourers Federation, for example, have resulted in people getting wage rises far beyond what the airline pilots are asking for at present. The Labor system cannot work. There is a better way-voluntary agreements, which any mature industrial society must have. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of what the Labor Party has done in regard to this dispute? Firstly, let us consider the fact that we have a huge foreign debt. It was $32 billion when the Labor Party came to power. It is running close to $128 billion, or $130 billion, today. It is out of control. During the last sitting week the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brought down his Budget. We all recall that, the year before, the treasury estimate of the deficit was $9.5 billion. In reality, on 31 June this year it turned out to be $17.5 billion. This year the Treasurer said that the deficit would be $18.5 billion. The deficit position of this country is out of control, and this is at a time when we have the best conditions facing us: high commodity prices, good world markets and a strong world economy. The only response the Government has made to this chaotic situation is to enforce a very high interest rates policy which suppresses industry and denies our import competition. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day it will be the Liberal Party and the National Party, in government, which will have to clean up and pay back the huge debt that will have been left to us. But a bigger problem than paying back that debt will be interest payments. When I went out to earn a living, one of the first things that was said to me by one of my elders was that borrowing money is not the problem; the real problem is paying the interest on it. That is the real killer for Australia today-the interest on the $130 billion-odd that we owe. It is utterly irrelevant for the Labor Party to say that most of that debt is private, that it is not government debt. It is all a charge against the Australian dollar. We saw proof of that in the statement of the Reserve Bank of Australia a couple of weeks ago. It pointed to the grave dangers we were in under the present policy of this Government. Only last night we heard that Moody's Investor Services Inc. had downgraded Australia's credit rating. Goodness knows where we are going to end up on its scale. We have gone from AAA to AA2. We might well end up at ZZZ if Mr Keating is around long enough. I quote one sentence from Moody's report:</PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless we believe that the Budget fails-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the Federal Budget of a couple of weeks ago-</PARA>
<PARA>to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity, and that lies at the heart of the Australian problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian population is frightened by this debt position, and well it might be. This Government is making it worse by the minute by not coming up with any constructive solutions to end the pilots strike. One of the key industries involved is the tourism industry, which last week reported record earnings of $6.5 billion, eclipsing coal, at $6 billion, as Australia's biggest export earner. The importance of that lies in two dimensions: firstly, in its vulnerability and, secondly, in the fact that it is not all profit. We have made a huge investment in the tourism industry in the last three to five years. In other words, unlike the cattle industry and the coal industry, which we bought in the prices of decades ago, and amortised the cost, we have made our investment in the tourism industry in today's prices and at today's interest rates, and we are crucially dependent on traffic flow through them to pay them off, let alone to earn money for us. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing about Australia's tourism industry is that it is a vulnerable industry because we are a long way from anywhere. Fares to Australia are high. We cannot afford to charge the top world market rate for our hotels because, if we do, the economics of a holiday in Australia for tourists becomes uneconomic. The important thing in relation to tourist trade is predictability. Unlike Australian employees, who enjoy six weeks holiday with 17 1/2 per cent loading, many employees in the United States have to work for a couple of years before they are entitled to holidays, and then it is only 10 days or 14 days. A similar position applies in Japan. For American or Japanese tourists to come out here on their holidays, they have to know with absolute certainty that on the Monday morning after their holiday they will be back in their work place, otherwise they lose their job. </PARA>
<PARA> The tourism industry, which employs 480,000 people, is currently estimated to be losing something like $5m a day as a consequence of this strike, to say nothing of the money that is going out on the overseas carriers which are acting as strike breakers. We are bleeding to death. What we require is a rapid resolution of this dispute. The dispute is going to be resolved but, if one listens to the Labor Party, one would believe it never was. It is going to be resolved in the only way possible: by talks between the employers and the employees. I do not want to take sides on who is to blame. I think fault lies on both sides. One certainly cannot have preconditions put on those talks by employees if one is to expect employees to come to them but, at the end of the day, we have to get back to commercial reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots are prepared to talk. Their productivity must go up. I agree with those who say that. But, in fairness to the pilots, their low productivity does not result simply from their bloody-mindedness. It results from this Government's great degree of over-regulation. Civil aviation regulations prevent any employer from extracting much over 60 per cent of the nominal hours to be worked. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor is the poor management of the airlines. I am the only person left on this side of the chamber who voted against the two-airline Bill. I voted against it at the time because it did not provide any competition at all between the airlines; it did not provide for commercial reality. One of the consequences has been that air fares have gone up beyond the reach of most people. Another consequence has been that the management of the airlines have been able to run on a cost-plus basis. They have not addressed the matter of productivity with the pilots, the way they should have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done? All we have had from the Government is irrational statements from Mr Hawke, publicly abusing his opponents and trying to score some cheap political points by acting like a latter day cardboard Rambo. I am very interested in Mr Hawke's deprecation of pilots as bus drivers and in his talking about his own experience in this field. I challenge Mr Hawke to table his log books in the Parliament so that we can see how many hours he actually flew. My advice was that he was scrubbed off the course at Oxford because he could not pass his trial introductory flight. At the end of the day, we have this Government acting as strike breakers. We have this Government leaning on the Civil Aviation Authority, granting licences to carriers like Arrow Air, which has a dubious safety record, in a matter of hours when normally it would take a matter of months. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is bleeding to death. The Government knew that this problem was coming. It did nothing to pre-empt it. It did no contingency planning to avoid it. It has no way of helping the employers or the employees to settle their dispute. But, hopefully, all this is just the death throes of the dinosaurs of the trade union movement and, though we pay a high price for it, I hope that Australia benefits ultimately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by giving credit to Senator MacGibbon who has managed to speak in this debate for a quarter of an hour about the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy and the airline pilots dispute and has mentioned either matter on only one or two occasions. Senator MacGibbon correctly identified the fact that he and the Opposition are on a real loser in this debate. Senator Lewis deserves congratulations for having the courage to debate this matter this afternoon. Throughout the airline pilots dispute it has been the Opposition's industrial relations policy that has been under the microscope, not the Government's. We find ourselves in a position where on the one hand the Industrial Relations Commission, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the Government, the airlines, the travelling public in Australia and ordinary Australian workers are united in their opposition to the demands of the airline pilots and, on the other hand, the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots is demanding a 29.47 per cent wage increase which we all know our nation cannot afford. Somewhere in between these two we find the Opposition, the Liberal Party and the National Party, floundering as usual because its industrial relations policy is exposed. In the unlikely event of the Opposition ever being elected to government we would have hundreds of these sorts of disputes. There would be unmitigated industrial chaos. This matter of public importance proposed by Senator Lewis claims two things: firstly, that the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy has failed and, secondly, that the Government's industrial relations policy has led to the disruption caused by the pilots dispute. I hope that in the time I have available to me I can address both those issues. The key assumption of Senator Lewis is that the Hawke Government's industrial policies over the past 6 1/2 years have failed. Of course, it is a false assumption and one which can be easily debunked by an examination of the Government's record.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator says it is disastrous but, in fact, the industrial relations record of this Government is one of its greatest achievements. The cornerstone of its success has been the prices and incomes accord which established an effective mechanism of consultation and cooperation between government, employers and trade unions in the wage fixing process. I know that Senator Stone and others have an obsession with the accord. They have to realise that the accord emerged out of the economic shambles and the industrial disputation of the Fraser years. I accept that it has resulted in the Government and the trade union movement working for common objectives. It is worth looking at the effectiveness of the Government's industrial relations policy and comparing it to the disastrous reality of the Fraser Government-the Liberal Party in government during the Fraser years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us take inflation. The consumer price index to the June quarter 1989 was 7.6 per cent. It was 11.5 per cent in the Fraser Government's last year. The average weekly earnings to May 1989 delivered under this Government's industrial relations policy rose by 7.5 per cent. In the last year of the Fraser Government it was 11.6 per cent. The real unit labour cost index is down 13.9 per cent under Labor with productivity up 1.2 per cent per annum since 1982-83. Under the Hawke Government 1.5 million new jobs have been created, which is a 23.9 per cent increase during its term of office. Conversely, unemployment is down from 10.1 per cent under the Fraser Government in early 1983 to 6.1 per cent now. Again, it is all under Labor's industrial relations policy. Real gross domestic product is up 3.3 per cent in 1988-89. During the period of the Fraser Government the average increase was 2.1 per cent. I suppose the trump statistic, when talking about the Hawke Government's industrial relations policy, shows that industrial disputes are down by a massive 59 per cent under this Labor Government. It appears to me that it is this record of achievement that Senator Lewis is so keen to condemn. The Opposition wants to ignore the pathetic efforts made during the Fraser years but condemns Labor's outstanding record. The facts speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the Opposition's nervousness in this whole issue. I think this nervousness is fully justified because the Opposition has a real dilemma. It wants to make political capital but it knows that the issue is likely to turn back on it and on its bankrupt industrial relations policy. I have to say that the Opposition is very brave in bringing on this debate and exposing the weakness of its position. In fact, it is pretty obvious that it is the Opposition's industrial relations policy that we are looking at and which is on trial in this dispute, not the Government's. Senator Macklin mentioned the excellent article written by Pamela Williams in the Australian Financial Review yesterday. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>The dispute between the airlines and the pilots has been a microcosm of the central planks of the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy--</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Observers waited in vain for the plaudits to fall from the Opposition's lips as the companies acted swiftly on the industrial action, pulled the pilots out of the wage system, sought direct bargaining with individuals and then pressed the pilots towards the courts with lightning speed--</PARA>
<PARA>How embarrassing it is for the Opposition to be exposed like this! So-called enterprise bargaining with the right to opt out of the centralised wage fixing system is the central theme of the Liberal and National parties industrial relations policy. What about enterprise bargaining? Is not that just what the pilots have done? The result of it is there for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been interesting to note Senator Chaney's response to this matter. Far from praising the pilots for following his Party's industrial relations policy, he has criticised them severely for opting out of the system and seems intent on getting them back in. He said in one of his press releases:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots have access to arbitration and yet they thumb their noses at the Industrial Relations Commission when it orders them not to engage in stoppages. </PARA>
<PARA>This sounds to me very much like an endorsement of the Industrial Relations Commission and a repudiation of his own policy. It is an admission right from the start that the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy is unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short amount of time that is available to me I would like briefly to look at the merits or otherwise of the pilots claim. I say at the outset that their claim is totally unjustified. The increases that they are asking for equal the annual income of the average Australian worker, and pilots already enjoy very high salaries. As the much quoted Captain Fitzsimons, the former President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, said in a bulletin to Ansett pilots:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no other group of pilots in the world that enjoy your overall standard of pay protection. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the pilots do not seem to have a real understanding of what they could have achieved under the centralised system. They should look at what other aviation industry workers have achieved-that is, up to 12 per cent increases with productivity and work practice concessions. The pilots are being absolutely unreasonable because they want their 29.47 per cent claim granted before any trade-offs are discussed, and, of course, that would then mean there was no longer any need for them to concede anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, what I would like to stress is that this dispute with the airline pilots has demonstrated the bankruptcy of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. I say that the nation cannot afford the wage demands of the airlines pilots and more importantly the nation cannot afford the chaos that would result from the implementation of the Liberal and National parties' industrial relations policies. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that just over nine months ago, on 22 November 1988, the Government tabled its discussion paper on AIDS-`A Time To Care, A Time To Act'. That paper presented the wide range of issues and options relevant to the HIV epidemic in Australia as a basis for consultation, discussion and formulation of a national strategy on AIDS for the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time my colleague, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), promised the members of this Parliament and the people of Australia that he would return in the 1989-90 Budget context with a clear, broad strategy to guide Australia in the management of AIDS during the next stages of the epidemic, and that the Australian community would have the opportunity to participate in the consultative process. That process is now complete. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy information paper presented today sets out the policies and programs which the Federal Government believes are appropriate to deal with the HIV epidemic into the 1990s, as well as the parameters for funding, administering, coordinating and monitoring this country's AIDS programs and activities. The national strategy encompasses complex medical, scientific, economic, legal and moral issues within a framework in which the protection of public health is always paramount. </PARA>
<PARA> It has absorbed and reflects a wide range of views obtained from the comprehensive consultation process which involved State governments and authorities, the research community, those who care for people with HIV, the private sector, unions, people with HIV, the Australian National Council on AIDS, the Intergovernmental Committee on Aids, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, the Parliamentary Liaison Group on AIDS, concerned individuals and representatives of many community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The cornerstone of this process was the six working panels which Dr Blewett established early this year to provide a forum for public consultation. Those six panels-which included members and senators from both sides of this Parliament-held 38 meetings and met with 1,800 people from Perth to Cairns, Hobart to Darwin, Alice Springs to Palm Island, and visited prisons in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. The reports of the panels were published in May this year and, along with the written submissions received, provided a broad-based and bipartisan input to development of the national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy information paper, or White Paper, is not just a document for governments, people with AIDS or those who care for people with AIDS. The policies and programs it contains are designed to reach and influence all members of the community because AIDS has the potential to touch the lives of all Australians. When Dr Blewett addressed parliamentarians on this issue last November, he informed us that 1,100 cases of aids had been reported in Australia, that 538 of those people had died, and that the number of cases continued to mount inexorably. </PARA>
<PARA> On every day since then, at least one new case of AIDS has been reported. On almost every day since then, another life has been lost to the disease. As at 9 August 1989, there have been 1,414 cases of AIDS reported in Australia, and 733 of those people have died, nine out of 10 of those Australians who have contracted the disease are or were under 50 years old. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact, Mr Acting Deputy President, that homosexual or bisexual transmission continues to account for the overwhelming number of AIDS cases in this country, some 88 per cent. However, incidence of the disease among intravenous drug users, including homosexual and bisexual intravenous drug users, has risen to 3.8 per cent and heterosexual transmission has increased to 1.6 per cent of reported cases. </PARA>
<PARA> While prevalence of AIDS remains relatively low among these latter groups, the experiences of overseas countries, particularly the United States of America, demonstrate starkly the incipient threat which AIDS continues to pose to the wider community. In the United States, HIV infection is as high as 30 per cent among intravenous drug users and is steadily increasing in the heterosexual community. In New York city, for example, AIDS is the biggest killer of women under 30 years and, tragically, one in 60 babies is born with the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys carried out in Sydney show increasing rates of infection among intravenous drug users from less than one per cent to more than 10 per cent over the past two years. With the estimated number of drug users in Australia ranging from 90,000 to 130,000, the potential for spread through the drug conduit among the heterosexual community is, therefore, inescapably significant. Denial of that threat now would be unwise and ultimately, of course, tragic. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Mr Acting Deputy President, there are some people in positions of influence within our community who are encouraging others to deny the potential for transmission of the virus among the heterosexual population. Rather than viewing the currently low prevalence of heterosexual infection as an opportunity to modify behaviour pre-emptively, and thus turn good fortune to good management, they choose to use data showing what was happening yesterday as an excuse to deny that a real problem exists today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is these same people who seek to undermine Australia's consensual approach to AIDS with allegations that our policies to deal with this epidemic have been hijacked by the homosexual lobby. It was just such divisive and damaging tactics which Johathan Mann, Director of the World Health Organisation's global program on AIDS, spoke about at the fifth international conference on AIDS in Montreal in June. Dr Mann warned that a third epidemic of social, cultural, economic and political reaction and response to AIDS:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in which the twisted bring forward their twisted ideas of massive cover-ups and AIDS conspiracies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that this:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . threatens increasingly to overshadow and overwhelm the epidemics of HIV and AIDS themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Mann said that this third epidemic could be as important to our future as the virus itself if complacency, fatalism and marginalisation were allowed to reduce the commitment to or change the course of efforts to protect public health. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who peddle these myths about gay conspiracies, who prefer the potentially fatal consequences of denial to the guarded optimism of realism, either fail or refuse to understand that the cooperation of the victims of AIDS-in this country to date, predominantly homosexuals-is essential to our ability to stem the epidemic. We have never disguised the rationale of our efforts to give people with AIDS confidence in the health services of this country through our emphasis on privacy, on confidentiality, on anti-discrimination, on adequate counselling, on opposition to compulsory testing, on endeavours to reduce the stigmatisation associated with AIDS. None of these steps has been taken primarily on the grounds of civil liberties or human rights, but on the grounds of public health. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has always believed that the protection of public health, rather than the preservation of individual rights, must be the overriding concern in developing and implementing AIDS policies; that public health and individual rights march hand in hand on the AIDS issue because the health and well-being of the many is dependent upon the cooperation of the few. In the words of Admiral J. D. Watkins, in his landmark report on AIDS in the United States, effective anti-discrimination protection is, paradoxically, the sine qua non of an effective HIV containment policy. That paradox is possibly the most important thing we have learned about management of the AIDS epidemic since Dr Blewett first addressed the Parliament on AIDS more than four years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also learned that history holds no simple truths for combating AIDS, and that there are no easy answers to this awesome health crisis. AIDS is a new disease presenting a unique set of public health problems. But there have been a few shafts of light. We have learned that the overwhelming number of Australians have the strength to resist the temptation to succumb to draconian measures offered as facile and ineffectual `quick-fixes' to the disease and that we possess the individual and collective commonsense and will to take the superficially less attractive, but potentially much more effective decisions demanded by AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has become internationally acclaimed for its approach to the dilemmas posed by the disease, leading most countries in the world in terms of the development of logical, cohesive and effective containment policies. Our efforts have won praise because, from the beginning of the epidemic, we have taken a cooperative approach involving the development of an unprecedented partnership and level of trust between all levels of Government, all political parties and the affected community groups. The production of this policy information paper is another first for Australia among the developed nations of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The twin goal of Australia's unique national HIV/AIDS strategy is to eliminate transmission of the virus and to minimise the personal and social impact of HIV. It is ambitious and purposely so. The Government believes it would be derelict in its responsibility for the public health of Australians if it were to be anything less. The goal is supported by 10 principles developed to guide the formulation of policy and appropriate program responses. They are that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Transmission of HIV is preventable through changes in individual behaviour; education and prevention programs are necessary to bring about such changes. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Each person must accept responsibility for preventing himself becoming infected through sexual intercourse or the sharing of needles and for preventing further transmission of the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The community as a whole has the right to appropriate protection against infection. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The law should complement and assist education and other public health measures. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Public health objectives will be most effectively realised if the cooperation of people with HIV infection and those most at risk is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Specific informed consent should be obtained before any task is performed to diagnose a person's HIV infection status. The result should remain confidential, and appropriate pre- and post-test counselling should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. People infected with HIV retain the right to participate in the community without discrimination, and have the same right to comprehensive and appropriate health care, income support and community services as other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Professional care-givers have a duty to care for infected individuals; governments, employers and unions have a responsibility to provide working conditions and training programs which minimise the risk of occupational transmission. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Research into the epidemic is essential to the management of the epidemic.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. General principles of public health, service provision and the legal system should be applied to the HIV epidemic; special measures or services require justification. </PARA>
<PARA> The national strategy has six key elements-education; prevention; treatment, care and counselling; access and participation; research; and international cooperation. It is based on our best scientific knowledge at this time. Obviously, if a cure or vaccine were to become available, or if radically new treatments became available, or if the nature or progression of the virus were to alter significantly, the Government would need to reconsider the appropriateness of the national strategy. The education and prevention strategies outlined in the paper are premised on the basis that transmission of the AIDS virus is preventable and that education remains the most effective means of prevention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record, specifically for the benefit of people who continue to argue that our AIDS education efforts to date have been improperly targeted to the whole community rather than to people most at risk, that the Government spends approximately $7.50 per head on AIDS education within high-risk groups, compared to approximately 27c per head on AIDS education on the whole community. It will be heartening for all senators to note that major studies indicate a decline in the rate of infection in homosexual men and a significant behavioural change among homosexual and bisexual men. While none of this is reason for complacency, nor any indication that the epidemic has peaked or stabilised, it does indicate that the emphasis we have placed on, and hopes we place in, preventive education are not misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA> The education strategy outlined in our policy statement has three broad target groups:</PARA>
<PARA> People whose activities place them at greater risk of infection than the general community and those infected;</PARA>
<PARA> carers of people with HIV, including professional care-givers; and</PARA>
<PARA> the general community. </PARA>
<PARA>A new national media campaign will have two specific purposes. First, it will address the specific educational needs of groups which might not be reached through community-based programs, including bisexual men, non-dependent drug users and people of non-English speaking background. Second, the campaign will be used to raise the level of awareness in the general community about modes of transmission and to allay fears and prejudice about the virus. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be consulted in developing a public education campaign directed against AIDS-related prejudice and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Commonwealth AIDS prevention and education-CAPE-program will replace the former existing community education grants to provide funds to community-based organisations which develop nationally relevant prevention and education programs for priority groups identified in the national strategy. Funds will be earmarked for grants to organisations developing programs for Aboriginal and Islander communities, people of non-English speaking background and services for tertiary students. The States will receive substantially increased education and prevention funds to meet State priorities. Some of this matched funding will be tied-for example, the Government is asking the States to ensure that education programs are introduced for prisoners and prison staff, people in residential institutions and their families and carers, homeless young people and children in detention centres, police and other State employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Education must start with the young. It is essential that the young people of Australia are aware of the facts about HIV and the risks of transmission and that they are sensitive to the issues which cause prejudice and fear. Accordingly, included in the funding for the States is an amount to be directed to the Curriculum Corporation of Australia, a company owned jointly by the State and Commonwealth Ministers of Education. The Curriculum Corporation will assess and, where necessary, develop HIV-related curricula and provide teaching material for schools. By providing funds for this purpose, the Commonwealth is demonstrating its commitment to providing appropriate public health education to young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> A key issue which was identified by many groups in the consultative process was the need to provide educational opportunities for people in the work force, especially professional care-givers. A Commonwealth AIDS work force, information, standards and exchange-or CAWISE-program has been designed to ensure that the work force has access to information and resource materials, retraining and skills development programs and development of guidelines and standards. Grants will be provided to unions, professional and employee associations and employers. Funds have been earmarked for the development of guidelines on nutrition and HIV infection, a national code of practice for counsellors and a care model for Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> Another new initiative, HIV study grants, to be cost-shared with the States, will be available to professional care-givers to undertake short term training and development in another State's hospital system. This will particularly give professional care-givers in States with low AIDS caseloads an opportunity to learn on the ground from the experience of their colleagues in States and hospitals with high caseloads. </PARA>
<PARA> While education is a key preventative strategy which is critical to elimination of the virus, other prevention strategies require the agreement and cooperation of governments or relate to personal choices. Significant among these issues is testing for the virus. The Government will continue to encourage testing, with the specific informed consent of the individual and with pre- and post-test counselling. Knowledge of one's HIV status provides an opportunity to encourage changes in lifestyle and behaviour and to provide the earliest possible treatment and care. Testing and counselling is already widely available, but could be made more so, and State governments will be asked to improve community access to testing with counselling by expanding the availability through family planning clinics and other community health centres. People whose activities place them at greater risk of infection will be strongly encouraged to fulfil their duty to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, there are some situations where the public interest demands that people be prohibited from participation in certain activities unless they accept testing and are found to be negative. Such mandatory testing will continue to apply for donors of blood, tissue, organs and semen. The Government considers compulsory testing to be applicable in only four situations, namely: testing of prisoners on exit from prison; testing of persons charged with a sexual offence where requested by the alleged victim; testing of a person where necessary to determine medical treatment of another person-for example, in providing treatment in the event of a needlestick injury; and testing of a person suspected of being HIV-positive who is placing others at risk of infection. In the last three situations, testing should be implemented as a last resort and should be ordered only by a judge in a closed court. </PARA>
<PARA> This also applies in confining an individual who is wilfully or knowingly placing others at risk of infection and who is likely to continue to behave in such a way despite appropriate counselling. Hearings in such cases should be conducted in a closed court with restriction orders given for a fixed period and subject to rights of review and appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines on the testing of patients for surgical procedures, based on the interim guidelines established by the Australian Health Ministers Conference earlier this year and endorsed by the Australian Medical Association, are set out in the national strategy. In essence, these guidelines state that testing should be encouraged where clinically relevant to the patient or where the patient is believed to be at high risk, and that such testing should be performed only with the patient's consent and with follow-up counselling if the result is positive. The Minister for Community Services and Health and the medical profession are confident that, when patients are advised of the relevance of the test in appropriate clinical situations, the response of patients will be overwhelmingly positive. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, some of the testing policies I have just outlined are primarily the responsibility of the States and require changes to legislation or, in some instances, new legislative measures. All these issues are to be examined by a subcommittee of the Intergovernmental Committee on AIDS, comprising officers from the departments of Health and Attorney-General, with a view to bringing consensus and uniformity to legislative initiatives arising from the national strategy. Rarely has there been so great a need for uniform policies throughout the nation. The virus does not recognise State boundaries. We should not allow such boundaries to interfere with an effective national response. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues to be covered by the legal review include: legal sanctions which impede the operation of needle and syringe distribution and disposal programs; legal sanctions which might impede the changing of personal use patterns of drugs which are not administered by intravenous methods; and laws which impede public health programs promoting safer sex, especially amongst homosexuals and prostitutes. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the testing of immigrants to Australia, the national strategy makes a distinction between applicants for permanent residence and applicants for temporary residence and tourist or other short-term visas. People who wish to migrate to Australia are currently tested for the virus if there are medical or other indications of infection. The Government has decided that mandatory HIV testing will be introduced for all applicants for permanent residence. </PARA>
<PARA> This is unlikely to have a significant impact on the spread of HIV infection, but HIV infection status, as with other medical conditions, is a factor to be considered when assessing applications on the grounds that there are considerable potential costs to the Australian community. But a positive result will not automatically exclude applicants from permanent residency; scope will be retained to approve applications where justified by compassionate or other circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stressed the importance of avoiding discrimination against people with AIDS, but it remains a fact that many people with HIV, their relatives, friends and carers have faced discrimination. Some have been dismissed from employment, some evicted from accommodation, others refused medical or dental treatment or perhaps harassed by the media. The Government is asking the States to establish, extend or clarify anti-discrimination legislation, to provide redress for people with HIV, their families and carers in basic areas such as employment, education and training, accommodation and supply of goods and services and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or imputed sexual orientation. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue will also be included in the legal review and will seek to ensure that people with HIV are treated fairly and equitably, and on the same basis as people with other life-threatening conditions. As a first step, the Government will bring forward amendments to section 33 of the Public Service Act and regulations under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Research is vital to our understanding and knowledge of the AIDS virus and in the search for a vaccine or therapy. Grants for AIDS research have been managed through the Commonwealth AIDS Research Grant Committee, a subcommittee of the Government's AIDS advisory body, the Australian National Council on AIDS, known as ANCA. The two special research units on AIDS virology and AIDS epidemiology and clinical research will be continued under the auspices of ANCA, and the Government has decided to establish a third ANCA special research centre on HIV social research. The new centre will be responsible for coordinating research into the social and psychological effects of the epidemic, identifying further educational and training needs and examining the impact of projects and policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our regional responsibility, Australia will publish results of AIDS research for dissemination within Australia and western Pacific, South East Asian and Indian Ocean nations. A new national clinician-laboratory surveillance scheme will be promoted through the ANCA special research centre for AIDS epidemiology and clinical research to improve the database on HIV infection in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Some good has already come out of this terrible epidemic in that it has inspired an extraordinary level of international cooperation. Despite the many issues which divide humanity, we have all united in our defence against AIDS. Developed nations are assisting less developed nations to combat the disease, some in the form of financial assistance and others by providing medical and scientific expertise. The Australian Government will provide $1m to the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau to provide help to our regional neighbours for activities such as securing the blood supply and study grants. In addition, Australia, in association with the World Health Organisation, will host a conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Canberra next August. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I have briefly outlined some of the major issues in the national HIV/AIDS strategy. The Government has allocated $318.5m over the next four years to implement the national strategy. In this, the first year, funds of $60.9m have been made available, an increase of 43.6 per cent on the previous financial year. Details of these funds are included in the national strategy document. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, Mr President, on behalf of Dr Blewett, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the preparation of the national strategy, particularly those honourable senators from the Opposition parties who gave so generously of their time, and who have ensured that both the spirit and the practice of bipartisanship have been preserved. They have helped to formulate policies which put the public health of Australians above all other considerations, but which recognise the aspirations of all citizens of this country to a dignified and secure way of life to a society which is free of prejudice and to a society which is caring, just and humane. Effectiveness of the national strategy will, of course, depend on cooperation between a wide range of sectors of Australian society, across the three levels of government, between government and non-government sectors, between unions and employers and between all these parties and people infected with the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it would be somewhat ingenuous to believe that everyone will agree with all that is in this national strategy. As Dr Blewett said in his speech to the Parliament in November, there will continue to be diversity of opinion between different States, different communities, different organisations and different individuals, and that diversity will be reflected in the range of programs established to respond to the virus. The Government believes that such diversity will continue to assist our national offensive against AIDS, provided it is underpinned by a solidarity of purpose. Solidarity gives us the confidence to face up to the challenge of AIDS and deal openly and honestly with the difficult and controversial issues it presents. I commend the national HIV/AIDS strategy to the Parliament and to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition welcomes this ministerial statement on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In particular, we welcome the opportunity to indicate our continuation of a bipartisan approach to dealing with Australia's principal public health problem of the moment. In his comments today the shadow Minister for health, Mr Peter Shack, extended his congratulations to the Government for the production of a White Paper. In a statement today, he said that the Opposition offered a continuation of bipartisan support for the AIDS initiatives outlined in the Government's AIDS White Paper which, by and large, endorses the same policy objectives already laid down by the Liberal and National parties in the document on AIDS policy which we published in June this year. Mr Shack went on to deal with a number of matters, one of which I particularly highlight at this stage. In his statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, in view of widespread evidence that IV drug users pose the greatest threat to the infection being transmitted to the wider community it is imperative that the Government pays close attention to the need for extensive research into the development of a foolproof single shot, non-reusable syringe. </PARA>
<PARA> Until such time as a suitable device is found, however, we are in accord with the Government's view that IV drug users should have ready access to needle exchange and drug rehabilitation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding goal of any policy on AIDS must be that which we spelt out in our policy, and that is to eliminate the transmission of HIV infection to ensure that no more Australians than is the case now will be affected by the disease. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to return in due course to the question of drug use and intravenous (IV) drug users. As I said, in June this year the Liberal and National parties published their own policy statement on AIDS. I am glad to say that the differences, such as they are, between our policy statement and that which has now been put down by the Government are very minor. They tend to be ones of emphasis and ones of particular specific matters that we want to highlight rather than any substantial disagreement between the political parties on the way in which we as a nation should respond to this epidemic. </PARA>
<PARA> As the statement presented by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) makes clear, a very extensive process of consultation was undertaken in developing this strategy. We saw initially the publication of the so-called Green Paper, a discussion paper entitled AIDS: A Time to Care, a Time to Act. A series of working parties was then established to examine that paper. The Minister indicated the effort that they made. There were some 372 written submissions and responses to the Green Paper; something like 1,800 people at 38 public meetings throughout Australia took part in the consultative process; prisons were visited in three States; and the working parties made contact with people who previously had not been drawn into the process of consultation in the formulation of government policy. I had the great honour to chair one of the working parties, namely that which was responsible for looking at the question of `Testing for HIV Infections'. My distinguished colleague Senator Peter Baume had the responsibility of chairing one of the panels which dealt with the very vexatious question of IV drug users. A number of honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives from both sides of the Parliament participated very actively in the work of these panels. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 15,000 Australians are believed to be infected with HIV. The World Health Organisation has estimated that between five million and 10 million people are affected worldwide. There are, however, some significant difficulties in obtaining precise data. There are difficulties in knowing whether the rate of infection is increasing, whether it is stabilising or whether it is declining. Indeed, studies undertaken in Sydney by Professor Cooper and others have indicated that perhaps there is some evidence that the rate of new infections may be declining. At the same time, a report prepared by the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University entitled Predicting the course of AIDS in Australia and evaluating the effects of AZT indicates that the incidence of, and number of people infected with, the virus could still be increasing. We have seen comments by research workers at the Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research that there are new estimates about the rate of infectivity, that in fact there are changes in the analysis of the time that it takes between initial infection and the onset of clinical symptoms of the disease. For example, in the Melbourne Herald of 21 August it was reported that one of the senior researchers at that centre had said that researchers now suspected that 12 weeks was becoming the normal period between becoming infected with the virus and antibodies being identified by the standard test-the so-called `window' period-and that it appeared that there was a mean time of 9.8 years between being identified as antibody positive and becoming ill. If that is the case, we are talking about up to 10 years before we will be in a position to make a reasonable evaluation of what is happening today. We are now looking at a picture the origins of which may lie 10 years back in history. We simply have no capacity other than best available estimates to know exactly what it is we are dealing with as far as the precise nature of this epidemic is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague very rightly points out that there is a social premium on the question of non-detection. I hope to have time to refer to that later this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also know that there are changes within the population of persons who are infected. We know from quite reliable data that there has been a major change in the behaviour of certain groups in the community. We know from cohort studies that, by and large, the male homosexual groups in Sydney have undergone a quite significant change in their behavioural attitudes. The latest figures reflect a particularly disturbing trend of a 12.4 per cent increase in transmission of AIDS through IV drug use and a 25.6 per cent increase in transmission by vaginal sex in the past 12 months. Again, we are therefore dealing with a permanently shifting series of issues to be addressed. Policy and policy responses need to be sufficiently flexible to cope with those changes as they take place. We know, for example, that there is an increased interest now in the effectiveness or otherwise of azidothymidine (AZT). Governments have to adjust to strategies which determine the most effective use of that drug therapy. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that there is an increased interest in alternative methods and alternative ways of dealing with this infection. Trials are being undertaken in Sydney in a program known as the community AIDS trials network. Some of the fast-tracking processes are being put into place which may require us to modify the fairly strict protocols and standards which have otherwise been put in place for drug evaluation. There is a lively debate in the community about the nature of education programs. I want to say something about that later because this is absolutely central to the way in which we will address the challenges of this epidemic in the years ahead. An article in the 22 April 1988 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, entitled `Preventing the Heterosexual Spread of AIDS' and written by Hearst and Hulley, raises some questions about the nature of the message being given in terms of addressing the heterosexual community as to whether patients are being given the best advice about the infection and strategies to combat it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw a couple of points from the Minister's tabling statement. I refer particularly to the need to recognise the extent of the problem in Australia. The number of cases has now risen to 1,414 in Australia and 733 of those persons have died, the overwhelming majority being under 50 years of age. As with the United States, we are seeing an increasing problem in terms of intravenous drug users and in terms of the impact that this disease is having on the female population and on the number of children being born either HIV-infected or at risk of contracting HIV infection. The Minister's tabling statement makes it clear that there must be a strategy based upon both education and prevention on the one hand and the necessary investment in research on the other. But the point is made that none of these programs is going to succeed unless there is a sound basis in terms of community support and of voluntary groups in the community playing a significant role in coming to grips with this as a matter of national priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Steps have been taken to address the very vexatious questions of the treatment of people in the medical setting and the Minister's statement indicates that the guidelines of testing patients for surgical procedures have been based on the interim guidelines established by the Australian Health Ministers Conference earlier this year and subsequently endorsed by the Australian Medical Association. I endorse that and and I am glad to see that some of the difficulties that have been occasioned in that area are being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be wrong, however, not to indicate that not everything in this statement is greeted in a totally uncritical fashion by the Opposition. We have, for example, expressed some disappointment that the base grant budget allocation to the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations under the excellent chairmanship of Dr David Plummer, which serves as an umbrella for all of the grassroots and community organisations to which I earlier made reference, will remain at only half a million dollars, indexed to the consumer price index until 1992-93. Paragraph 10.5.10 of the report sets out the Government's arguments as far as that is concerned. However, I believe that the Government would have done better to invest more money in support of AFAO and would have got better value for its public health dollar by seeking to put more directly into community organisations and somewhat less into the bureaucratic structures which are now starting to take on a life and a dynamic of their own and perhaps in some respect impose a bureaucratic solution on a problem which is essentially and quintessentially one which is not going to respond to traditional bureaucratic and health department methods of approach. I have some concerns in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn, therefore, to the White Paper itself. The White Paper is useful in that it sets out clearly a set of goals. My colleague Senator Peter Baume has often regaled the Senate with the necessity in such matters as public health policies of setting down clearly the goals, the desired outcomes, of a program. The goal is established in paragraph 3.2.1 of the report, in which it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that the human immunodeficiency virus may impinge on the lives of all Australians, the national HIV/AIDS strategy aims</PARA>
<PARA> to eliminate transmission of the virus; and</PARA>
<PARA> to minimise the personal and social impact of HIV infection. </PARA>
<PARA>The White Paper then goes on to set out a series of 10 guiding principles. I will not repeat all of those, as they were encompassed in the Minister's statement a few moments ago, but they involve some of the issues to which I have already referred. First of all, the White Paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>Transmission of HIV is preventable through changes in individual behaviour; education and prevention programs are necessary to bring about such changes. </PARA>
<PARA>I again make the point about education. I am concerned that we should not allow the education strategies to become entirely monopolised by the bureaucracy and by bureaucratic ways of going about this. The report is quite correct in saying in paragraph 4.1.6:</PARA>
<PARA> Programs for specific groups may not be suitable for general consumption, but appropriate information should be available to all Australians regardless of risk status. It is particularly important to maintain awareness when the risk level is perceived to be low for the majority of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> That makes the point that some of the AIDS education programs and prevention strategies will need to be specifically targeted to particular groups, whether they happen to be gay men, intravenous drug users, or whoever else. Many people in the community will find those programs offensive, distasteful and disturbing; nevertheless, unless they are specifically targeted in a manner which the target groups understand, respond to and are prepared to encompass in a way which causes them to make behavioural changes, they will not be successful. It is very important, therefore, that the community involvement of which I spoke earlier is quite central to the way in which the Government goes about dealing with this problem. Another of the guiding principles is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The law should complement and assist education and other public health measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is very important. The report says at paragraph 5.7.11:</PARA>
<PARA> Laws regulating and/or penalising homosexual activity and prostitution impede public health programs promoting safer sex to prevent HIV transmission, by driving underground many of the people most at risk of infection. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 18 of my own panel report entitled `Testing for HIV/AIDS', the testing panel makes the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth should take a leadership role in relation to the removal of major disincentives to testing including:</PARA>
<PARA> Laws which maintain homosexuality, prostitution and the possession of syringes as a criminal offence;</PARA>
<PARA> Inadequacy of privacy laws; and</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of anti-discrimination laws. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the recommendations among many from the six testing panels which has found its way though into the White Paper, and I am particularly gratified to see that. The other point I want to draw out from the guiding principles is that which relates to consent for testing, a point to which I will return briefly. The White Paper says, as principle No. 6:</PARA>
<PARA> Specific informed consent should be obtained before any test is performed to diagnose a person's HIV infection status. The result should remain confidential, and appropriate pre and post-test counselling should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is absolutely critical. As I said, there is clear evidence that a number of the people perceived to be engaging in high risk behaviour have modified their behaviour and have acted responsibly in so doing. Paragraph 4.2.2. onwards of the report draws attention to the extent to which homosexual men in particular have modified their behaviour, and the report goes on in 4.2.5 to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Research conducted by Macquarie University and the AIDS Council of NSW concluded that nearly 80 per cent of homosexual men in that study had modified their behaviour in response to AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA>A group which is frequently abused in the public debate, namely sex industry workers, is clearly identified as people who have also modified their behaviour. The report says in paragraph 4.2.19:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a low prevalence of HIV among sex industry workers. </PARA>
<PARA>It indicates the extent to which people in that industry, largely due to peer education, advocacy and support initiatives by sex workers' representative organisations, together with the knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases which many adult sex workers had prior to the HIV epidemic, have played a significant role in that regard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The next issue to which I wish to turn relates to the series of points raised in the White Paper about mandatory or compulsory testing of people who are or who might be suspected of being HIV positive. In paragraph 5.2.10 the White Paper indicates two areas in which the Government has determined-in relation to the first, I think, quite properly-that there should be mandatory testing of people to establish the presence of HIV antibodies. This first issue is the question of testing blood products and donated tissue, organs and semen. I think nobody would have the slightest difficulty as far as that is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the second area in which the Government has determined that there will be mandatory testing is for applicants for permanent residence in Australia. That raises one unanswered question, that is: At whose cost? The White Paper is silent on the question of who has to bear the cost of undertaking these tests. Quite clearly, there will be some circumstances in which the reliability of the tests will be a matter of dispute. I believe there are certain places around the world where the medical standards and, indeed, the incorruptibility of medical practitioners are not necessarily as high as in Australia and in most of the countries from which we will be drawing applications for permanent residence. I hope the Government will look very carefully at the questions of the validation of the results, of the integrity of the tests, and of who bears the cost of undertaking these tests. The Opposition does not, in any sense, object to the principle that there should be mandatory testing for permanent residence. In fact, that is comprehended in the policy document which the Liberal and National parties have already published. I make the point that the Government quite clearly and properly concedes that a positive test result will not, in itself, automatically disqualify an applicant from being granted permanent resident status where it is believed that there are overwhelming compassionate or other compelling grounds which should allow the applicant, nevertheless, to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point about testing is that all testing should be accompanied by appropriate pre-test and post-test counselling, especially where people have been encouraged to undertake the test voluntarily. Again, that is not only entirely proper but also consistent with the policy that the Opposition has laid down, and is entirely consistent with the recommendations which the testing panel made to the Government through the consultative process about which I have already spoken. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are a number of other circumstances in which the Government is proposing that there should be some system of compulsory testing. In a number of those circumstances-and I do not have the time this evening to go through them all in detail-it is proposed that those tests shall be undertaken in circumstances in which an application may be made to a judge, and a judge, in closed session, will be able to determine whether a compulsory test should be conducted. Those circumstances include the testing of persons charged with a sexual offence, where the request is made by the alleged victim; the testing of a person, where necessary, to determine the medical treatment of another person-and the example given here, which I think is somewhat tendentious but which I do not have time to discuss this evening, is providing treatment in the event of a needle-stick injury; and, finally, testing of a person suspected of being HIV positive who is placing others at risk of infection. In those situations the application will have to be made to a judge who will hear it in closed court and make a determination. As far as the testing of persons suspected of being HIV positive is concerned, we presume this means suspected under the aegis of the public health laws of the States concerned. I would certainly be extremely concerned if it were to be assumed that a person might be suspected of being HIV positive by, for example, a policeman or a law enforcement officer and, on the basis of that person's suspicion, dragged before a judge to be potentially tested for the presence of the AIDS antibodies. I hope that will be clarified quickly by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The one area where it is quite clear that there will be testing in a fully compulsory sense is in terms of the testing of prisoners on their exit from prison. I might say that, on this occasion, this actually runs contrary to the specific recommendation made by the testing panel. When it looked at this particular matter the panel which I chaired did not favour the compulsory testing of the entire prison population, nor any system of compulsory testing in terms of the point of exist from prison. A couple of points need to be made. The first is that presumably this testing will be done not at the very point of exit but at a reasonable time in advance of exit so that the window period problem can be addressed. Secondly, there will be a major legal problem arising with a system whereby some States test prisoners on entry to the prison system, if they are negative at that stage, and, when they leave the prison system, they are tested again and found to be positive. The question arises of what their redress is against the State if they claim that they have become antibody positive as a result of the negligence of the State in relation to such questions as homosexual rape within the prison system. These points raise some very significant questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The final points which I want to make in relation to this matter before I conclude are these: the report is properly very positive about the approach that needs to be taken as a matter of urgency to deal with the question of intravenous drug users. My colleague Senator Peter Baume has made a number of comments about this, and his panel's report ought to be read by everybody who is interested in an understanding of this problem. There are something in the order of 130,000 drug users in Australia. Most of those are so-called recreational users who, from time to time only, share needles. In many respects, these people are more at risk than the people who are regarded by the community as hard-core regular intravenous drug users. Programs need to be properly designed to deal with the circumstances in which these people find themselves. That is terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the spread of AIDS into the wider community through intravenous drug use is so poorly understood at the moment that it really requires the Government to make this a major focus for its attention. The whole question of the Government's drug strategy needs to be thoroughly re-examined. I do not think it is working. I do not think it can work on the premises that have been laid down at the moment. Yet, if it is not addressed quickly, it will become the major problem before we are capable of responding to it. I raise that as a critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is this: underpinning all of this strategy will be the need for effective antidiscrimination legislation throughout this country. Admiral Watkins submitted his report entitled Report of The Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic to the President of the United States of America on 24 June 1988. That is a most important document because it identifies clearly the necessity to have in place legal protection and legal regimes regarding the question of anti-discrimination policies to underpin the degree of voluntary cooperation and consent which is necessary to get people to support government strategies in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not had the time this evening to examine the question of AZT, how its use is to be funded, how it is to be provided, and what indeed are the critical therapeutic and social science issues arising as far as that is concerned. I therefore conclude on this point: changing the behaviour of people is absolutely fundamental to getting the AIDS strategy right. Behavioural change is a question of social arrangements and social attitudes. It is incumbent upon the Parliament, the Government, the Opposition-all political parties-to work together to bring about the climate of changes in social attitudes which will allow people to cooperate, to participate and to make their contributions to dealing with the AIDS epidemic in Australia. That is the challenge which faces us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Puplick for his penultimate point and for the point he made immediately before the penultimate point, namely, that the intravenous (IV) drug user is one point on which a great deal more attention needs to be placed. I want to return heavily to that in the remarks that I want to make. Secondly, while he did not quite put it in these terms, I think he was saying in his penultimate point that the emphasis in the treatment of AIDS and in relation to intravenous drug use must be seen in relation to those factors as threats to the public health. We need to get that clearly into focus and attempt to put aside questions of morality and of judgment and the other social and judgmental-type matters which are often raised with respect to both these questions. I think that is a point that needs a great deal of emphasis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I seriously begin, though, I noticed that Senator Puplick used the term `needlestick injury'. Could I just make a minor point: I personally object to the invention and the introduction of totally unnecessary new words into the English language. When somebody gets stabbed with a knife we do not talk about a knifestick injury, or when they get stabbed with a sword we do not talk about a swordstick injury. I do not know why we talk about a needlestick injury. Why not a needle injury? I hope that one can adopt that use instead of putting another unnecessary word into the language. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, AIDS is indeed a very serious threat to the public health, and I believe the seriousness of that threat is not properly realised either by the public or indeed by many politicians. Honourable senators will recall that last year I raised as an urgency debate the matter of the provision of intravenous drugs under controlled conditions to intravenous users, specifically with the idea of controlling the spread of AIDS in the community. In the course of that debate Senator Knowles labelled that proposition as grossly premature. I was interested to note that, within several weeks of that debate, in which both the Government and the Opposition voted against my urgency motion, Mr Shack, the Opposition shadow Minister for health, was in fact making exactly the same point-that this really was the way to go with respect to the control of the spread of AIDS. In the same debate Senator Rosemary Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA>any prospect of moving towards what is proposed in Senator Coulter's motion is down the line. It is being considered only as a prospect for a pilot study. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in her remarks she had said:</PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether this really is a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>So I reflect on some of my colleagues, because I think they are not, even so, recognising the great seriousness of this threat to the community posed by AIDS. I believe that, if we fail to understand and respond appropriately to this rapid increase in the numbers of HIV-positive people and people with frank AIDS, the consequences will be serious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), in his statement points out that, while 88 per cent of AIDS cases are accounted for in the homosexual or bisexual community, 3.8 per cent are present in the intravenous drug users and 1.6 per cent already are among the heterosexual community. Going on from that, the Minister drew attention to the fact that in the United States the HIV infection is as high as 30 per cent among intravenous drug users and is steadily increasing in the heterosexual community. In New York City, for example, the Minister said, AIDS is the biggest killer of women under 30 years of age and tragically one in 60 babies is born with the virus. </PARA>
<PARA> The HIV virus has emerged very recently as a human pathogen. Since its first detection the number of infected people has increased rapidly. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome was first reported in the United States in 1981, only eight years ago. One case was reported in Australia in 1982. That person is now dead. Six were reported in 1983. All are now dead. Forty-two cases were reported in 1984, of whom 41 are now dead; 113 in 1985-96 now dead; 224 in 1986-174 dead; and 345 in 1987, with 160 already dead. Picking up on the Minister's figures again, he points out that by late 1988 there were 1,100 cases-that is the totally integrated number over all time-of whom 538 have already died. By August this year there were 1,414 cases, with 733 dead-52 per cent in all. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the point is often made that, notwithstanding those numbers we know about, the numbers infected and not yet showing signs or symptoms are probably much larger, and it is suggested that that number may be perhaps 20 to 30 times larger than the number showing symptoms; that is, the number of HIV-positive people in Australia probably already lies between some 10,000 and 40,000 people. It has been suggested in a number of papers that all those who are HIV-positive will sooner or later develop AIDS and that, of those 1,414 who have developed AIDS in Australia and the 733 who have already died, 90 per cent of those diagnosed in 1985 and 98 per cent of those diagnosed in 1984 are now dead. I repeat again that 52 per cent of all those diagnosed have already died. </PARA>
<PARA> So far in Australia most of the cases and most of the transmission have been in homosexual men. This is the first phase of the infection. The HIV virus is spread very effectively through unsterilised needles, and we know that for a fact. The virus has not got a natural predilection for men. In fact, in some papers it is suggested that, if anything, women are probably more prone to acquire the infection after being exposed than men are. So through the intravenous drug route the virus is being spread to the female and then into the heterosexual male population. </PARA>
<PARA> Infection of IV drug users is the second phase that is now developing. It has already been developed in the United States, and this phase will provide the link to the heterosexual community, thence to women, and thence to the unborn. The difficulty I have with the Minister's statement is that, while it deals well with questions of research and of overcoming problems of discrimination against those people who are infected and problems of education to prevent infection, it does not really seriously address this problem of closing the window of infection through the intravenous drug user. It is this IV drug link which must be broken. Again I stress the figures from America. In the Minister's statement we find that the number of infected people in Sydney has increased. The Minister says that the numbers have increased from one per cent to 10 per cent of intravenous drug users in the past two years. In other words, we have already seen a substantial increase in that group of people and it will be the link between the homosexual group and the heterosexual group, the more general community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to stress something about the HI virus because the Minister picks up the vain hope that some type of a vaccine is likely to be developed. The HI virus is an RNA virus. Most cells have DNA in their genetic library. DNA is reproduced by cells with a very high degree of genetic reliability, the sequence integrity is very highly preserved. When an RNA virus gets into a cell it must back-translate the RNA into DNA. It uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to do that. Reverse transcriptase is notoriously error prone. It makes a great deal of errors when it is translating the RNA into DNA. These RNA viruses are extremely subject to mutation. For that reason it is extremely likely that the virus will present itself in a great number of different forms. The possibility of preparing a vaccine against it is certainly as difficult, if not more difficult, than the problem of preparing vaccines against the flu virus, another virus which is notoriously mutable. </PARA>
<PARA> A single patient has been found with as many as three different strains of the AIDS virus. The virus has almost certainly mutated so quickly that those strains have derived from the one strain within the single patient. It is possible-I stress this-to imagine that the AIDS virus could mutate to a form which could be transmitted by non-sexual means. We need to think about that and recognise that this virus is so mutable that it is one which presents an enormously potential threat to the community-one which needs to be taken a lot more seriously than we have taken it. </PARA>
<PARA> Last November I moved a matter of urgency in this place calling for the Federal Government to provide intravenous drug users with their drugs of addiction in ways which did not involve the sharing of needles and the consequent risk of spreading the AIDS virus. I then argued that this would have a number of other benefits both for the drug user and for the community as a whole. We must think about drug addiction and the spread of AIDS essentially as public health problems. We must put aside questions of judgment and morality. We must think of addicts as people needing help and not as criminals to be punished. We must think of a society in which more people are turning to drugs as a sick society needing treatment and not one merely needing more gaols and stricter penalties for the victims of its social and economic ills. We must conceptualise the drug addiction-AIDS situation as a medical problem, not as a criminal one. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey conducted last year showed that 5 per cent of adult Australians, or 80,000 people, had injected drugs at some stage of their lives and 2 per cent, or 30,000 people, has done so within the last 12 months. Both the Minister and Senator Puplick mentioned the figure of 130,000 possible drug addicts Australia-wide. Intravenous drug use ranges from the once only experiment to the occasional user through to those who may inject themselves as many as eight times a day. Thus we are not just talking about drug addicts. The majority of drug users are occasional users. While drugs remain illegal, these occasional users are most likely to obtain their drugs through sharing with those who are more regular users. It is estimated that some 3 to 5 per cent of homosexual-bisexual men are intravenous drug users. Sharing needles is a much more effective way of transmitting the HI virus than either homosexual or heterosexual intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of causes of death among intravenous drug users. The most common of all will soon be AIDS. Only about 2 per cent of IV drug users died each year from their drug use-that is, pre-AIDS. In New York 20 to 30 per cent of intravenous drug users will develop AIDS within five years and will then live, on average, for one year. The greatest risk to the IV drug user is not the drug but the risk of getting AIDS. The greatest health risk posed to the community by the IV drug user is the risk of spreading AIDS. AIDS also places on the community a large and growing financial burden. There is no cure. Nursing care and hospitalisation are expensive. The only treatments are palliative not curative. AZT presently costs about $10,000 a year per patient. The 1988 cost of treating and caring for the 500 or so then living AIDS victims including other treatment costs and the associated AIDS dedicated expenditure by the Commonwealth was estimated to be approaching $50m. If no effective action is taken now this figure is likely to amount to $1 billion by 1993. I reflect on the Minister's statement which says that the number of IV drug users in Sydney has mounted very rapidly from one per cent to 10 per cent in as little as two years. If money to address this problem is not found the quality of care will deteriorate and our efforts to control the further spread of AIDS will falter. By that time it will be too late. We are already losing too much time in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Preferably the drugs would be used in these facilities and would not leave these places or as second best-this was hinted at by the Minister-drugs could be provided in non-reusable, single dose syringes. I prefer that they would be either self-administered or administered to the drug user on the site so that the drugs would not leave that place. Other advantages flow from that proposition. If these facilities could be set up in non-threatening and non-judgmental ways information, counselling and all the other services which these people need could be provided both with respect to their drug addiction and with respect to the risk which they face from taking drugs on the street. Many more intravenous drug users are also likely to turn to oral substitutes, such as methadone, because it would bring them into contact with these alternatives. In New South Wales, some 3,800 people are already in a methadone program. The demand exceeds the number of places. Only in Queensland has the methadone program managed to meet the demand. Clearly, the methadone part of a treatment regimen needs to be greatly increased, as under the proposal which I put forward last year and which I repeat now, it is expected that many more people would seek methadone as a substitute for intravenous drugs. These facilities would provide the sorts of education that the Minister talked about. They would be places where people would come face to face with the ability to get information about drug addiction and about AIDS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council has suggested a limited provision of intravenous drugs as an experiment. This does not seem to get a mention in the Minister's statement. But I believe-and I pointed out last year-that a trial in only one area would not succeed because that area would attract intravenous drug users from other areas. It would appear that, in keeping the data on such a trial, one had produced an increase in drug addiction. I believe that nothing less than a national trial over a reasonable number of years is necessary to prove the efficacy of such a proposal. This would provide an alternative source of drugs and would tend to reduce the illegal supply of drugs and all the other costly associated problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Drug use and addiction, I believe, must come to be viewed as a medical social phenomenon requiring medical and social management, not criminal sanctions. There is good reason to believe that the same cultural restraints that prevent the majority of us from becoming alcoholics, despite a ready availability of alcohol, would also operate to control the use of intravenous drugs if the Government accepted a proposal that intravenous drugs be supplied, under the conditions I have outlined, to intravenous drug users. </PARA>
<PARA> Society faces a large, rapidly growing and deadly threat from the AIDS virus, a threat which I believe, even in the Minister's statement, is underestimated. The doorway through which the virus is passing into the general community is the intravenous drug user. We must close that door now. The only way that is practically available to us is the safe, controlled provision of injectable drugs by the state. The Minister's statement talks about research. It is good to see an emphasis on a research program, particularly one directed to HIV social research and the factors which lead to the spread of this virus. The Minister's statement talks about education. Of course, education is important. The statement talks about anti-discrimination. That is also important. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support these initiatives, but they are not enough. They are less than 50 per cent of what needs to be done. They do not tackle the window through which AIDS is spreading into the heterosexual and wider community. Shall we continue to wring our hands in inactivity in this area while we collect a perfect set of statistics confirming the spread of a virus that we can now so accurately predict?</PARA>

For all those things we should be very grateful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I declare a couple of interests. I enter the debate having chaired a working panel on intravenous drug use. I was interested to hear the comments of Senator Coulter. They were very brave. I think honourable senators may not have understood just how radical and how right his suggestions were. As I have said, I was chairman of that working panel on intravenous drug use and HIV/AIDS. I advise honourable senators of that because they may wish to discount some of what I say now. Further, I have a small business interest which involves me advising people on HIV/AIDS, and I want my colleagues to know about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a member of the Parliamentary liaison group and I am a consultant for the World Health Organisation. I have consulted in several Pacific countries. When I consulted in Papua New Guinea last year it became apparent very quickly that it had no secure blood supply. It is to the credit of Australia and the Minister for Health, as he then was, I think, that within days after having brought the report back, a senior official was in Port Moresby working to help our neighbours secure their blood transfusion supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people would like to respond to the epidemic that faces us by denial and avoidance. But that is like living in a house on a ridge and seeing black smoke bellow out of the valley, seeing sparks around you but not wanting to face the fact that there is a fire somewhere. It simply will not do. Avoidance will not work as a strategy. Yet many people in the community still want to use avoidance. They want to say, `We won't be infected, and those near and dear to us won't be affected. So let us assume it is the result of things that are done by people we do not like, doing things we do not approve of and let us respond with punishment, with quarantine and with isolation'. </PARA>
<PARA> The working panel which I chaired had public meetings all around Australia. We had one public meeting in Cairns at which a professionally qualified gentleman, a veterinarian, came before us and said, `In veterinary science we have a simple rule. We cull and shoot'. That was his going-in position as to how we should deal with HIV infection. It will not do. It will not work for reasons which colleagues have pointed out. It simply is not an option. It is like saying that we will pretend that homelessness among youth does not exist. It is like saying that we will ignore the fact or that we will pretend that we do not understand why between 7 and 10 per cent of all male Australians are homosexuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people will say `Let us just ignore it. It is an inconvenient fact'. Such an approval will not work. It is to the credit of the Government that its approach to this problem has not been to go down that route. It has not tried avoidance. Neither has it tried denial, pretending that there is no problem, pretending that we can just close our eyes and that it will all go away-because it will not. Neither has the Government gone down the road of saying, `What we simply need is harsher social control, a whole range of social control policies; more punishment, more rules, more regulations, or to find an island off the coast of Australia and send people there'. That was put to the committee. I said to the witnesses, `What happens if I am a member of a close knit family and I turn out to be infected?'. They said, `That's tough'. That kind of policy will not work. Within the document a number of quite difficult issues are addressed, and are addressed well. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend a few moments saying something about intravenous drug use. It has been referred to by earlier speakers. The pattern of intravenous drug use is well described and has been well reported by other honourable senators. The stereotypes of intravenous drug use are simply wrong. If we make policies based on these stereotypes they will continue to be as ineffective as all our policies on intravenous drug use have been over as many years as we have been making them. I remind honourable senators that one of the leading psychiatrists in Australia, an exciting person, John Ellard-the doyen of Australian psychiatry-published a book of essays last week with the rather intriguing title Some Rules for Killing People. The title was taken from one of the essays which dealt with capital punishment in Australia. Another essay on drugs and imprisonment addressed the question of the use of narcotics and other injectable substances. </PARA>
<PARA> Ellard makes the point that the model we have chosen to use in this country traditionally, a model of prohibition and punishment, has never worked, is not working now, and will never work. He asks the question: What goals are we seeking to achieve with such a program? If the goal is to punish wicked people, he says that is fair enough. If, however, the goal is to avoid some of the adverse effects of intravenous drug use, the present policies do not work. If the goal is to prevent the use of these substances, the present policies do not work. If the goal is to prevent some of the harm that will flow from intravenous drug use, of which HIV infection is now the latest and most awful evidence of harm, these present policies will not work. If they will not work, why do we stick to them? Senator Coulter is quite right to ask that question and, in his own way, to say that the policies will not work and that they need to be changed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter was quite right. The working panel on which I served made a number of recommendations designed to have us re-examine some of the ways in which we do things in this country in relation to drug use. We did not go as far as Senator Coulter and some of our recommendations have been rather cautiously included in this statement. I hope they are taken up. For example, the laws of some of the States put in jeopardy those people who are trying to run needle exchange programs. What do we think we are doing? If needle exchange will reduce the spread of the virus, people engaged in those programs should not be put at risk of arrest, yet the current laws put them at that risk. There are some States where the current laws make it difficult for people to use methadone. If methadone, given orally, can lead people to use fewer injectable drugs, that may help us avoid the spread of the virus, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ellard in his excellent book draws attention to the situation in our prisons in Australia. If we had sought to design a system to facilitate the spread of the virus our prisons are that. Approximately 50 per cent of our prisoners are there for drug related matters. The percentage of prisoners who use drugs is very high and because of the laws of supply and demand, of which my market orientated friends remind me occasionally, it is not surprising that injectables get into prisons. All that happens is that a price is put on them. They get into prisons and they are available. </PARA>
<PARA> We were given evidence on the working panel that at one time there was so much injectable material in Pentridge Gaol that some of it was exported back to the streets of St Kilda for sale. Our prisons are awash with this material. The only thing the prisoners do not have is injecting equipment. We had evidence that up to 70 people share one needle and syringe. We have already heard that there is no more effective way to spread the virus than blood to blood spread. If miserable people are put into our prisons with a drug habit-people who share equipment while in those prisons-it is very likely that they will come out with the virus. Is that what we want to do? I hope it is not. It will not do just to insist that our prisons will be drug free, because they are not. One of the points that Dr Ellard makes in his book is that those prisoners who have used opiates are generally stuporose and are no trouble. The trouble comes from those who have been able to get some vegemite, or some other yeast containing compound, to make themselves alcohol inside the prisons which, of course, is quite easy to do. They become argumentative and obstreperous, and they tend to fight. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that the question of intravenous drug use is not just an isolated issue which a few funny people in the community think we are getting wrong. It is now a matter of vital and immediate concern to Australia as a society. If we get this one wrong we could end up like New York city where the majority of intravenous drug users are now infected with this virus, where there will be tens of thousands of people dying a horrible death from this disease, and where the laws of New York State make it certain, make it unavoidable, that the infections will continue to spread. What is required is law reform. What is required is a new look at the social arrangements we have for controlling intravenous drug use and for managing this problem. If I have any criticism of this document-and it is a very small one-it is that it is a little tentative in taking what I think are necessary and radical steps in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that worries me is that I think we are using denial in another way. I fear that we are scared of being labelled racists. I fear that many of us are underestimating the terrible risk that may face our indigenous population. I fear that because of associated health problems and some of the living conditions which people face, the risk of spread may be greater than is generally acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> I was attracted to an article in the Brisbane Sun of 17 August in which the hospital superintendent from Thursday Island, Dr Peter Holt, expressed his fear that AIDS may sweep through his Torres Strait community in the coming decades for a variety of reasons which have to do with underlying health, with the present incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, with poverty and with many other factors. I would hate to see us unwilling to say what is happening because of undue sensitivity-that certain of our Aboriginal and Islander colleagues may find it difficult to accept certain things. Finally, we are denying the likelihood of the spread of the virus into the heterosexual community. Of course, the illness has been mainly a male homosexual illness in its first wave. No-one denies that, but it is not a disease--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is reported in the Green Paper. I can get the reference for the honourable senator. It was also reported that 4 per cent had had that experience fairly recently. All that says is that there are groups within our society with particular cultural behavioural patterns. It is the behaviour that is dangerous, not the group to which one is said to belong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many unresolved problems remaining before us in this attempt to manage, control and minimise the dreadful epidemic that lies ahead. There are problems which are technical and I do not care to try to comment on the whole range of technical matters. We are aware that there are technical problems, some of which we are overcoming. There are problems of confidentiality and I think this may be the major unresolved problem in Australian society. I used to work in a large public hospital. I knew the rules for confidentiality and so do we all. If someone came in with an interesting illness, on a bad day it might take 30 minutes for the information to get right around the hospital. So much for confidentiality!</PARA>
<PARA> It may be impossible, in spite of all the rules that are made, to preserve the rights of individual citizens. For example, if for perfectly good reasons we require testing of certain people, and if they are then found to be positive, I want to know that our large institutions will not only carry out proper cross-infection control but also will try to preserve the civil rights of those citizens. Otherwise, they are likely to be made scapegoats or discriminated against. At the present time our social arrangements are such that there is great danger in allowing anyone to know that one is HIV-positive. No-one here is unaware of the little girl who lived at Erina out of Gosford. Little Eve was found to be HIV-positive and so as a result of that information she had to leave her preschool, her family had to leave their home, her father had to leave his job and in the end the family had to leave Australia. Confidentiality is a major issue. Confidentiality is one of the major issues to be addressed in respect of employment and solutions have to be found. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a question of a balance of rights. Again, if put my doctor's hat on, some of the concerns of the medical profession are not unreasonable. There are concerns about dangers in treating people who might give one a fatal illness. There are good reasons for wanting to test people in hospital before surgery is undertaken. The treatment that I offer to a person may be affected by certain knowledge. If I know that someone's immune system is damaged, I may want to vary the treatment I give him. I may wish to avoid certain treatment. I may wish to advise him differently. So there are actual benefits for the person. But this question of balance of rights is still before us and has to be argued through.</PARA>
<PARA> I want a policy that will be effective in achieving the goals which have been identified in the paper. I agree with Senator Puplick that there are goals which we need to accept as desirable outcomes. Our goal is to prevent new infections. If we can do that, we will have gone a long way. The way to avoid new infections is to seek to encourage people to change their behaviour. Another goal is to minimise the adverse effects on those already infected; we can seek to do that as well. I do not mind if the Government says it will now test all intending migrants. The White Paper makes it clear that that is done at least in part as a matter of cost containment. That is okay; that is the right of government. I do not mind if we determine to test all prisoners. But I agree with Senator Puplick that we should test people not only on exit but on entry to prisons. A person should be able to say to the States who incarcerate them, under social arrangements which we support, `If I go into that prison free of infection and come out infected, I will sue the State for its failure to exercise its duty of care'. The parents of young Jamie Partlic are now suing the State of New South Wales-quite properly-for what happened to their boy when he was bashed in Long Bay gaol. The question of duty of care is one which our State prison authorities are going to have to address and which we as a Commonwealth are going to have to consider because there are Commonwealth prisoners in State prison systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want an HIV-AIDS policy that works on the principle of allocating blame, of making certain groups, scapegoats or of attaching bad motives to some of those who are infected or might be infected. I am not really interested in people's power games-people who have come into the public debate with an agenda that has to do with whether or not they will be able to attract and control more resources. Of course, some of the players do give that impression. I want to see those who are infected supported properly. I want to see the Commonwealth go down the road it has outlined and seek to cooperate with others, particularly with the State governments who have so many of the day to day management decisions to make. I want this policy to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis is so great that if we do not master this disease now it will decimate our society. I know that even if no new infections occur-and that is an impossible ideal-things will become very much worse over the next 10 years in terms of people already infected. The Opposition policy released last June, which was set out and described by Senator Puplick, fits well with this Government policy. I believe that we have a multi-partisan political approach to this illness. I hope that the policies go well together but I hope most of all that we can make them work effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always considered that the tragic death toll and suffering caused by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Australia requires absolute frankness and commitment to the truth. There is a great need in the educational arena to tell the facts of life and that ought to be at the basis of Government policy. I am not intimidated by people who might suggest that I am being judgmental or that I make moral judgments. Those who know me would know that this allegation is completely untrue. Most of them would be aware of my strongly held view that no human being has a right to judge the interior disposition of another and that AIDS sufferers are entitled to our unconditional care and support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for making moral decisions-and I think Senator Coulter was quite wrong-we have to make moral decisions. We are required on the basis of the threat which this disease is posing to the national health to do what is best. If choosing what is best done and what is best avoided is a moral decision, then I am happy, and everybody else ought to be happy, to be accused of making a moral decision. What is a moral decision but to choose what is better or best? We all have a responsibility to work for the care of AIDS sufferers, for the prevention of the disease and for the creation of a social atmosphere which will avoid the spread of the disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had some other pressing matters to attend to today, as no doubt other senators have, and I am not in a position to deal with all of the paper. The AIDS White Paper contains some very welcome initiatives, but it has aspects which I consider will entrench the very sexual promiscuity which is a major cause of the spread of AIDS. I refer to the latest epidemiological figures. In regard to the relating to the transmission categories of known cases of AIDS, homosexual-bisexual transmission represents 88.4 per cent of the total; transmission through IV drug use, 1.1 per cent; through homosexual-bisexual IV drug use, 2.7 per cent; through blood transfusions, 3.9 per cent; in haemophilia cases, 1.1 per cent; heterosexual transmission, 1.6 per cent; causes under investigation, 0.4 per cent; and none of the above, 0.8 per cent. These figures clearly reveal that of all AIDS cases in Australia 91 per cent have a homosexual cause. That is a fact that one must acknowledge and deal with. The question is whether the educational strategies are dealing with this. There is a trend in some surveys relating to IV drug users. One survey suggested that there are a large number of IV drug users at risk, but such surveys are inadequate. Nevertheless, we should address those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise a number of issues concerning the White Paper, particularly in regard to the educational strategy, which is directed towards three groups-people whose activities place them at a greater risk of infection than the general community and those infected; carers of people with HIV, including professional care-givers; and the general community. Chapter 4, paragraph 4.2.1, which concerns education for the general community, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Education for the general community will explain the facts of transmission of HIV, address fears and misconceptions and stress the need for men and women to take responsibility for safer sexual practices and other behaviour which may lead to infection. </PARA>
<PARA>The stress will be on the need for men and women to take responsibility for safer sexual practices. On page 42 `Safer Sex Practices' are explained. It is stated at paragraph 5.3.1:</PARA>
<PARA>The promotion of safer sex practices as a preventive measure has been integral to the general community education campaign. Safer sex practices include:</PARA>
<PARA> sexual activity not involving intercourse; or</PARA>
<PARA> the proper use of condoms during intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to explain what the first point means. Honourable senators ought to read that paragraph on page 42 as an indication of what we are likely to expect from the Government's AIDS education campaign over television and radio stations. The whole push is going to relate to safer sex practices. Any policy that addresses the problem of sexually transmitted AIDS without warning against promiscuous behaviour and which implies to young people that homosexual acts are just another way of life is deceptive and will create the climate for the continued spread of AIDS in the future. The White Paper states on page 31:</PARA>
<PARA>Sexually active young people</PARA>
<PARA>4.2.15 The key messages to be conveyed to young people in relation to their sexual activity are that risk can be eliminated through:</PARA>
<PARA> abstinence from sexual activity;</PARA>
<PARA> sexual activity only within a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner; or</PARA>
<PARA> safer sex practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The first two options are important and valid for many in our society. However, there is a need to be realistic about the behaviour of young people, and their freedom within the law. </PARA>
<PARA>Mention of the first two matters was made in the Minister's original statement to the Parliament, but those matters have not really been stressed in any of the education campaigns thus far. Indeed, the Government is now talking about being realistic. I am particularly concerned that, in the interests of what the White Paper calls `realistic' education, our youth will end up receiving a message that they can do what they like whenever they like and with whom they like provided they use a condom. This would have devastating and deadly results. It would attack the efforts made by parents to ensure that their children lead mature and flourishing lives. At paragraph 4.2.17 on page 32, the White Paper says:</PARA>
<PARA>The States can contribute to the education of young people by using curricula for schools which are honest, explicit and comprehensive about the options available for preventing HIV infection and about the care and treatment of HIV-infected students. The Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) will arrange for assessment of the curriculum, and development of teaching materials for teachers and students through the Curriculum Corporation of Australia, a jointly-owned company formed by the Commonwealth and State Ministers of Education. The curricula will be developed further as necessary. DEET, in conjunction with DCSH, will report an implementation of HIV-related curricula in schools. The States should ensure that HIV-related education is provided at the appropriate school level. </PARA>
<PARA>Where do the parents come into any of this? The White Paper's treatment of AIDS education in schools ignores the rights of parents who do not even rate a mention in the development or approval of AIDS curricula let alone their right in regard to their children's education. I am sure that, given what is in this White Paper and what has taken place so far, the facts of life still will not be told. The students will not be told the simple fact that homosexual acts are deadly and that any young man who tries homosexual acts, even with condoms, is running a deadly risk. The figures are there. That is not a judgment on the interior disposition of homosexuals. It is a question of telling the truth-and the truth is being hidden. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the position of parents or headmasters who may object to what is being taught to the students in the name of prevention of AIDS or safe sex. It is stated in paragraph 5.7.8 on page 47:</PARA>
<PARA> Protection is required for education and prevention workers from any liability which might exist for associated offences, such as aiding and abetting or counselling to perform illegal acts. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on, in paragraph 5.7.11 it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Laws regulating and/or penalising homosexual activity and prostitution impede public health programs promoting safer sex to prevent HIV transmission, by driving underground many of the people most at risk of an infection. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an assertion. In regard to homosexual activity where is the proof of that? I have not studied the situation so far as the prostitution side of it is concerned, but where is the proof in regard to homosexual acts? There is none. When was the last time any State legislation has been utilised in this regard? One of the protections that headmasters and parents have against the propaganda of the homosexual lobby into schools is this defence that it is against the law. And here is a recommendation in this document that educators should not be liable if they are aiding and abetting or counselling the performance of illegal acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, there are a large number of other things that could be said about this report but let us be clear on it so far as this education program is concerned. I refer to page 48 of the document where it says this about dissemination of information:</PARA>
<PARA>Information about minimising transmission of HIV is sensitive and may need to be explicit to be effective in the media. For this reason, the Commonwealth will review laws relating to censorship and, in relation to broadcasting standards, will consult with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to consider removing any unreasonable impediments to education and prevention programs, and to ensure the promotion of such programs in a non-discriminatory manner. </PARA>
<PARA>So they are going to review the censorship laws. Once the Government's AIDS campaign programs go to air, all of us are going to get calls from our constituents. What are we going to say? Are we going to say we did not get up here and object to what is proposed? I think we ought to know what is going on. On the one hand the Government says there is a danger that censorship laws are preventing the information being disseminated. What sort of information is it? What sort of explicit information is to be shown on television and at what times? The Government suggests that it will review laws relating to censorship. Senator Peter Baume talked about anal sex. Many of the X-rated videos, which this Commonwealth Government under its censorship laws allows, promote this high risk AIDS behaviour. If the Government is going to look at censorship laws, best it look at those. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that on a previous occasion I spoke of my concerns about the suggestion that was in the AIDS policy discussion paper that unborn babies should be aborted on the grounds that they have or might have AIDS. I then asked: What kind of caring AIDS policy is it that would foster a public attitude that defenceless, unborn human beings do not deserve to live simply because they have or may contract AIDS? That is the ultimate in discrimination. But the White Paper does not mention that. But I want to know what it means when it talks on page 38 about testing and counselling being currently widely available. It is stated in paragraph 5.2.5:</PARA>
<PARA> Testing and counselling is currently widely available, but could be made more so to assist individuals in their choice. State governments should improve community access to testing with counselling by expanding the availability through family planning clinics and other community health centres. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the more money over the last five years that has been given to the family planning associations the higher the abortion rate has been. I want some guarantee from the Government that no family clinic will recommend or counsel for the abortion of any unborn child on the grounds that that unborn child has or may contract AIDS. Apart from the fact that about 80 per cent of unborn babies of HIV-infected women are born without the virus, what sort of caring society are we if we have a policy of killing off an unborn human being, of saying that an unborn human being does not deserve to live because it might contract AIDS?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come back to the overall theme of the educational program thus far. I consider it to have been inadequate and I fear that this White Paper will only exacerbate the situation. By inferring that the sexually liberated fast lane way of life is okay, we endorse the mentality of instant gratification which has led to the despair of drug addiction and the perversion of homosexuality. I fear that we could run the danger of sanctioning a way of life that is literally killing our young people. In addition to the many deaths, there is the trail of ruined lives and broken families which the dead leave behind. Those who teach people allegedly safe techniques of blowing their minds on sex or drugs delude them into thinking that they can take the leap into drugs or sexual promiscuity without suffering consequences. That is not being judgmental about the interior dispositions of people; it is stating a fact of life. No matter how safe the sexual licence or how safe the resort to drugs, the life spent in the pursuit of desperate self-gratification will lead ultimately to despair and, in one way or another, to death. What is more, experience teaches that the person who is desperate for gratification in the last resort will pay no heed to safety. </PARA>
<PARA> I fear that if this sort of education goes into the schools it will only promote further destruction in the ranks of the young. I fear that the campaign would serve to attack the efforts made by parents to ensure that their children lead mature and flourishing lives. As I said, nowhere in this document so far as curriculum development in schools is concerned do the parents rate a mention, let alone a recognition of their rights in regard to the education and upbringing of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we can together approach this subject as it deserves to be approached, that as a caring society we can give unconditional care to the AIDS sufferers, that as a society we can ensure that the facts are told and that the policy is not unduly influenced by the homosexual lobby group which would have us believe that the homosexual lifestyle is equally as valid as the heterosexual. I consider that it would be totally unfair to our young people to introduce into schools a compulsory AIDS education program based on the philosophy of this White Paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not proposed to speak in response to the statement on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) presented by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) this afternoon, but coming into the Senate this evening for another reason I was moved to peruse the statement. As a consequence, I will make a couple of comments about it. I see that Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance, is in the chamber. It will no doubt be a matter of interest and concern to him that the Government has allocated $318.5m over the next four years to implement this national strategy on AIDS. The statement reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In this, the first year, funds of $60.9m have been made available, an increase of 43.6 per cent on the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that if I hunted assiduously through the Budget Papers I may find some other items on which the expenditure has increased at a similar rate, but I think I would be very hard pressed to do so. The size of the increase being provided in this area is extraordinary. I say that because a couple of months ago the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave us what some people have dubbed the world's greatest environmental statement which was obviously targeted at the interest groups he thought would be influenced by a statement on that matter. The Prime Minister went to Wentworth and planted some trees. I have seen some photographs which show that those trees are now under water. Once again, the Prime Minister chose his mark there with the same degree of judgment and accuracy which actuated him in his administration of the pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> After the environmental statement, we had the multicultural statement, again targeting another interest group in the community, again with the thought of an election not so far away down the track-a very cynical exercise in what one might these days call niche politics. Both of these statements place upon the taxpayers of this country considerable financial burdens. At a meeting in South Australia I was asked about these two statements by concerned citizens who had the same apprehension about them as I had, namely, that they appeared to be directed towards winning the next election for the Australian Labor Party at the expense of the taxpayers of this country. I agreed that that was probably a fair assessment of the quality of the two statements and predicted that there would be a lot more such statements in the months to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I predicted that there would be a statement directed to the Aboriginal lobby. Indeed, we have seen that both in the Budget and in the extraordinary spectacle to which we are being subjected in the Senate at present-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, a totally ill-judged piece of legislation which will take up an inordinate amount of time of the Senate. The legislation is directed to an objective which, when Australians as a whole come to understand what is proposed by this Government, will be rejected out of hand-I make no pun there-by most of them. So we have the Aboriginal statement, which I predicted at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I also predicted at that time that we would have a pensioner statement, and indeed we saw that in the Budget. I predicted that we would have a sporting community statement, and we have just seen that. In fact, it was referred to today by Senator Lewis when he was referring to the other rort which the Government has recently introduced-the provision of $30,000 a year postal allowance for members of the House of Representatives so that the Labor Party can go about a direct mail campaign operation in all marginal electorates around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also predicted that we would have a homosexual lobby statement, and that is what we have got today in this document placed before us. Do not misunderstand me, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am not suggesting that all the concerns of this document or all the concerns about the dreadful AIDS disease are to do only with the homosexual community, although that has principally been the case and remains the case to this day. But there is not the slightest doubt that that is what this statement is principally directed towards. </PARA>
<PARA> I think my predictions in that regard have been well borne out by events, but in that connection I just draw attention-and this is my second and last point-to a couple of passages only in this document. There are many other passages which I think could be addressed and which no doubt have been addressed by previous speakers before I came into the chamber. I refer to page 21 of the Minister's statement: The Government has decided-and one wonders why it has taken it so long to decide-that mandatory HIV testing will be introduced for all applicants for permanent residence in this country. How long has the Government been directing its attention to the development and spread of AIDS in this country and how long has it taken, therefore, for it to finally come to the decision, which has been pressed upon it for years by concerned citizens of this country, to adopt a policy of this kind? How long has it taken it to stand up to the misguided civil liberty groups in this country who, in their misplaced zeal, have argued that Australians should be concerned about the civil liberties of people wishing to become Australians, and not just Australians, even though those people-or at least a very minute proportion of them, I should say, to be correct-may indeed be harbouring, may have harboured, and certainly have harboured the HIV virus before coming into this country and providing a new centre of infection for those unfortunate enough to be in contact with them? But the Minister goes on in his statement, having announced that at last the Government has conceded what common sense has long demanded, to say:</PARA>
<PARA>A positive result will not automatically exclude applicants from permanent residency. Scope will be retained to approve applications where justified by compassionate or other circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder to whom the compassion should be directed-to the applicant or to the citizens of this country among whom the infected applicant will be free to spread the AIDS virus? We recently had news, which I suspect has had an impact in producing this belated decision by Dr Blewett, that 10 African immigrants, after having been admitted to this country, had been found on testing to be suffering from AIDS. That, of course, says nothing about the many others, no doubt, of whom the same could have been said. The Minister goes on in his statement to develop this same concern, this same process of putting the interests of some above others-I almost said the interests of the criminal against the interests of the community, which seems to be a commonly accepted doctrine these days. I do not wish to say that AIDS sufferers are criminals, but it is the same syndrome of concern-misplaced concern for some, but no concern for the innocent. The Minister goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have already stressed the importance of avoiding discrimination against people with AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA>I will say he `stressed' it. He spent the last two or three years stressing it, to the exclusion, I should have thought, of some of his other responsibilities in this area. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> But it remains a fact that many people with HIV, their relatives, friends and carers have faced discrimination. Some have been dismissed from employment, some evicted for accommodation, others refused medical or dental treatment, or perhaps harassed by the media. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say to all that no doubt that is all very distressing, but it is very likely that Australians will continue to shun-rightly or wrongly-people with a disease which is known to be fatal, which no-one has yet survived. Despite all the assurances of many people in the medical profession, citizens may continue to harbour doubts about the transmission of the disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to the next point, which is really the point I am going to conclude on. The Minister then says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is asking the States to establish, extend or clarify anti-discrimination legislation to provide redress for people with HIV, their families and carers in basic areas such as employment, education and training, accommodation and supply of goods and services and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or imputed sexual orientation. </PARA>
<PARA>All I want to say about that is that it reminds me very much of the famous story of Russia in the 1930s when Stalin was having people sent off to the gulags. The head of the NKVD, or whatever it was called in those days-perhaps the OGPU-came to Stalin to confess that he could not meet his quota: he was not sending enough people to Siberia, or not as many as Stalin was demanding. Stalin said: `There is no problem. If we want more criminals, we simply create more laws'. I predict that, if these laws were created, they would certainly create many criminals. I warn the Minister, and I warn the Government, that Australians will not go on putting up with governments which continue to legislate about morality or about behaviour in this way. They will not put up with it. They will not only throw governments out, but they will begin to ignore the law and put the law into contempt; and governments which legislate in such a way as to bring the law into contempt deserve themselves to be brought into contempt, as this one will be. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature or which correct existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. Only the amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to provide for reference appeals in the Australian Capital Territory will have any financial impact, increasing the expenditure of the Director of Public Prosecutions by an estimated $21,000 per year (less if outside counsel are not engaged). </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I propose to confine my remarks to the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Crimes Act 1914</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will insert two new offences into the new Part VIIB of the Crimes Act 1914 which deals with offences relating to telecommunications services. The offences will proscribe unauthorised call-switching devices and unauthorised interception devices. </PARA>
<PARA> The unauthorised call-switching devices have been found to be used in conjunction with the commission of betting offences and are capable of defeating attempts to trace the calls of those involved in the commission of such offences. The new offence will prohibit the manufacture, possession, use, sale, offering for sale or advertising of unauthorised call-switching devices.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to interception devices, whilst the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 currently prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, the interception of telecommunications, it does not contain a prohibition relating to devices by means of which interceptions are affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee on Telecommunications Interception recommended such a prohibition in its report tabled on 20 November 1986. In introducing the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1987 on 30 April 1987, the Attorney-General indicated that the Government was not at that stage in a position to act on the Joint Select Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Crimes Act 1914 gives effect to the Government's decision on this issue. It makes it an offence for a person to manufacture, advertise, display or offer for sale, sell or possess devices used to effect interceptions in contravention of the Interception Act. The new offence will not apply unless the device could reasonably be regarded as having been designed for the purpose of intercepting in contravention of the Interception Act. There is an exemption where a person is in possession of a device in the course of his or her duties where the Interception Act contemplates the lawful interception of communications. Further, there is provision for regulations to prescribe circumstances to which the new offence will not apply, for example, to allow manufacturers to develop and supply devices so that interceptions may be made as provided by the Interception Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Offences triable on indictment only</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963, the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 included in the Bill will ensure that, for reasons of the sensitive nature of proceedings for offences against these Acts, which may involve high matters of state or foreign policy, prosecutions for these offences can only be brought on indictment. </PARA>
<PARA>Attorney-General's consent to prosecutions</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and the Crimes (Aircraft) Act 1963 will ensure that the requirement that the consent of the Attorney-General, or (in the latter Act) a person authorised by the Attorney-General, be obtained for the institution of proceedings for an offence against either Act is extended to proceedings for `'related'' offences under the Crimes Act 1914, for example, attempting or conspiring to commit such an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment to the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides that a verdict of guilty of the lesser offence of committing an attack on an internationally protected person may be brought, as an alternative, at the trial of a person for murdering or kidnapping an internationally protected person. The amendment will enable the alternative verdict to be brought on the trial of a person for attempting to murder or kidnap an internationally protected person, and is intended to correct a problem highlighted by the Federal Court in Duffy v. R. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The Act is to be amended to allow the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal, or the Commissioner when that Tribunal has remitted disciplinary proceedings to him for imposition of penalty, to reduce in rank or dismiss from the Australian Federal Police a commissioned officer found guilty of a breach of discipline, without the necessity of seeking the approval of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment to the Custom Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA> Under provisions of the Act, a listening device warrant, issued by a judge to the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to assist in the investigation of a narcotics offence, may authorise entry on premises for the purpose of installing, maintaining, using or recovering the device. A definition of ``premises'' is to be inserted to make it clear that ``premises'' includes any area of land, structure, building, ship, vehicle or aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Evidence Act 1905</PARA>
<PARA> An amendment will authorise superior courts, when ordering that evidence be taken abroad under Part IIIB, to give directions for the use of that evidence in a committal hearing, a criminal trial or a proceeding for a civil remedy arising out of that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the evidence of a witness abroad must be taken each time in separate proceedings for use at committal hearings, any resulting trial on indictment, and related civil proceedings. This is a wasteful procedure, and the Director of Public Prosecutions has requested the amendment to enable evidence taken abroad to be used successively in proceedings of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The orders will be discretionary. The court hearing a proceeding will also have a discretion whether or not to admit the evidence obtained abroad. The amendment will give superior courts the power to rescind or vary orders made under Part IIIB. It will be possible, for example, for a defendant to seek a fresh examination of a witness located abroad to deal with issues that emerge at the committal hearing or afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act is also to be amended to allow the Attorney-General to prohibit evidence being given in Australia for use in civil or commercial proceedings in foreign courts, where the taking of the evidence would be prejudicial to Australia's security. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Act will confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear `reference' appeals in respect of any question of law arising from a trial on indictment in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. A reference appeal is one whereby a question of law can be submitted to an appeal court after acquittal, without the liberty of the defendant being affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will bring the Australian Capital Territory law into line with most of the States and the Northern Territory and will ensure that the correct view of the relevant law is established as a precedent, thereby ensuring that errors at the trial level are not repeated in later cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Privacy Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The Act is to be amended to enable Ombudsman's offices around Australia to receive and handle privacy complaints on behalf of the Privacy Commissioner. This is a cost-effective way of enabling the Privacy Commissioner to be represented Australia-wide and will provide individuals with convenient access to his office. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in the Bill adapt the operation of the Act to take account of the grant of self-government to the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. They provide for the proof of instruments, records and official acts with respect to Ministers and Legislative Assemblies of these Territories, complementing similar provisions in the Act relating to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> First, amendments will allow approved members of the Australian Federal Police, when executing warrants, to be given technical assistance by civilian technicians employed by the AFP. It has been found that such assistance may be necessary when technical difficulties arise during the execution of a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, an amendment will allow lawfully intercepted information to be given in evidence in proceedings under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 in relation to offences for which the penalty is imprisonment for at least 3 years. Under that provision, the Attorney-General may authorise the taking of evidence or production of documents before a magistrate in Australia for the purposes of a proceeding relating to a criminal matter in a foreign country. Such proceedings are not ones in which information lawfully obtained by interception may currently be given in evidence. The amendment will allow Australia to give an assurance of reciprocity to other countries from which Australia may wish to seek intercepted information relating to prosecutions for Australian offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption is to be specified as an agency which may apply for the issue of warrants under the Act and to which intercepted information may be communicated by other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill provides for the use of billing information obtained by Telecom by means of a technical interception to be used by Telecom in proceedings to recover a debt due to it. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974</PARA>
<PARA>One amendment to the Act will ensure that the Trade Practices Commission has adequate time to consider applications for non-merger authorisations. At present, the Minister has a power to limit to 4 months the time taken by the Commission to determine non-merger applications. The amendment will provide that the time taken by applicants in responding to requests for additional information by the Commission will not be included in that four month period. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Banking Act 1959 and other banking legislation to reflect a number of developments in the past several years. The major changes proposed are to provide the Reserve Bank with formal authority for the prudential supervision of banks; to remove the distinction between trading banks and savings banks; to replace the Statutory Reserve Deposit requirement on trading banks with a new Non-Callable Deposit requirement on all banks; and to make the arrangements for collection and publication of banking statistics more flexible. </PARA>
<PARA> The banking system is central to the operation of the financial system and has an important contribution to make to the wider economy. It is therefore important that the stability of the banking system be promoted through the observance of high prudential standards by banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank has a statutory obligation under the Banking Act to protect those who deposit funds with banks. In keeping with this obligation and its general responsibility for the stability of the financial system, the Reserve Bank has developed arrangements under which each bank is encouraged to keep itself in a sound financial position and to conduct its business in a prudent and professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The prudential requirements observed by banks in Australia, like those applying in other developed countries, relate to such matters as the adequacy of capital, the structure of assets and liabilities, management of exposures to risk, the capacity of its directors and senior management, and the representation of shareholders by directors. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements for prudential supervision have relied heavily upon the co-operation of individual banks. This system has worked well but in the light of the increased number of banks now operating in Australia, changes in banking activities and the more competitive and demanding environment in which banks operate, it is desirable for the Reserve Bank to have a clear statutory basis for its prudential supervision of banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that prudential arrangements for banks should be related to specific powers within the Banking Act and that the role of the Reserve Bank as prudential supervisor of banks should be recognised formally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Banking Act in a number of ways to achieve this. In particular, it will provide for the Treasurer, having consulted with the Reserve Bank, to recommend that the Governor-General establish requirements in relation to prudential matters by way of regulations. This power will be supplemented by an increase in the scope already permitted in the Act for the Governor-General to place conditions on banking authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also establish formally the role of the Reserve Bank in the prudential supervision of banks and transfer to the Reserve Bank the powers currently resting with the Auditor-General to conduct investigations of banks.</PARA>
<PARA> As consequence of the Reserve Bank's continuous conduct of prudential supervision, and the publication of its prudential rules, its present requirements are well known and understood by the banking sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Government's intention that the amendment of the Act should alter the prudential standards being met by banks or the way in which they are administered. Rather, the Government considers that the power to make regulations relating to prudential requirements should be seen as a reserve power to be used when circumstances require it. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed in this Bill will also give legislative effect to the Treasurer's announcement in the Budget last year of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks. The general nature of these amendments is to make the provisions currently applying to trading banks apply to all banks, and to repeal specific provisions relating to savings banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of a distinction between savings banks and trading banks no longer serves any policy purpose. In recent years most savings bank subsidiaries of banks have existed not as distinct physical or managerial structures but as different sets of accounts within banking groups. From a customer's viewpoint there is no effective difference between savings and trading banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Removal of the distinction between them will enable banks to have better use and allocation of funds, more simple funding and accounting arrangements, and greater flexibility in servicing customers. These gains will ultimately benefit bank customers through a lower cost of bank services. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of comments which have been received from the banking industry consideration is being given to some further amendment of the Banking Act to facilitate the integration of the accounts of savings banks and trading banks.</PARA>
<PARA> This change will not change the extent to which banks now lend money to customers for housing purposes, nor will it affect the price of housing loans.</PARA>
<PARA> The third major change proposed in this Bill is the removal of the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) requirement on trading banks. Both the Campbell Committee and the Martin Group recommended that this outmoded measure should be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> The SRD requirement has had distorting effects on the financial system because it has increased the cost of trading bank lending, diverted business to savings banks and other non-bank financial institutions, and encouraged banks to fund their operations through sources other than Australian dollar deposits, such as commercial bills, offshore borrowing and foreign currency deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer announced at Budget time the SRD requirement is being phased down over a three year period and replaced with a system of Non-Callable Deposits which banks will be required to maintain with the Reserve Bank as part of their obligations as authorised banks. </PARA>
<PARA> By the end of the transitional three year period all the banks affected will hold Non-Callable Deposits with the Reserve Bank equivalent to one per cent of their liabilities. The effect of the new arrangements will be to remove the distorting effect of the SRD arrangement and generally reduce the burden on banks and their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements represent a further and significant step in the process of financial deregulation which the Government has brought about with a view to raising the overall efficiency of the banking sector and thereby increasing the scope for it to contribute to the broader economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The change is estimated to involve a cost to revenue of $100 million each year, or roughly half the SRD revenue in 1987-88, by the time the transitional period is completed in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> Precise costs will of course depend on a number of variable factors such as the level of interest rates and the rate of growth in banks' assets and liabilities. The Government proposes to review the Non-Callable Deposit arrangements before the end of the transitional period and, in particular, to consider adopting a lower maximum rate than that currently proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes a number of other changes to the Banking Act and to related legislation with a view to ensuring that the legislative framework is relevant to the present banking system and flexible in its administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that arrangements for the collection and publication of statistics about banks should be simplified and made more flexible by allowing the details of these arrangements to be determined through regulations rather than spelled out in the Act as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The latter arrangement has proved to be inflexible in the light of the significant and rapid changes which have taken place in the nature of financial markets and the types of financial instruments used by banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's ability to monitor the financial sector will be improved by the scope which it will have under the amended Act to adjust the form of statistical returns which banks are required to make. We shall, however, keep in mind the continued need for consultation over such changes and for minimising reporting burdens. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be some resource savings both for the banks and the Government from these amendments, since unnecessary requirements will be able to be dropped more rapidly and the obligation on the Australian Statistician to receive and publish banking statistics, which duplicates work undertaken by the Reserve Bank, will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The First Schedule to the Act which lists authorised banks will be updated and a procedure will be introduced to allow the Treasurer to amend the First Schedule through publishing information in the Gazette. These changes will allow the public to be better informed as to those financial institutions which are authorised as banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made in the Bill for a banking authority to be revoked by the Governor-General where a bank requests it and the Governor-General is satisfied that there is no objection on grounds of national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provision will allow greater flexibility since, in contrast to the present section, it will allow an authority to be surrendered or removed where a bank has not ceased to carry on business but wishes to continue as a financial institution without having the status and obligations of a bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 66 of the Banking Act, which requires that consent be obtained from the Treasurer for the use of the word ``bank'' in a business name or as a descriptive expression in relation to the business of a financial institution, has been revised in the Bill to clarify the meaning and scope of the provision. The purpose of the more detailed provision would remain as before-to avoid confusion on the part of the public between banks authorised under the Banking Act and non-bank financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that a new provision be introduced into the Banking Act to provide a clear legislative basis for regulating the establishment of representative offices by international banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new provision it is intended that such banks should be required to seek the Treasurer's consent to open a representative office and to observe any conditions which he may establish. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision would formalise arrangements which now operate on an informal basis. It would not imply any change in the Government's policy of welcoming the establishment of representative offices to undertake purely liaison activities on behalf of international banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes some proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act and the Reserve Bank Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Commonwealth Banks Act would widen the Board's power over the Commonwealth Bank's capital structure in line with the revised definitions of capital announced by the Reserve Bank in 1988, and streamline the Commonwealth Bank's reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Reserve Bank Act are to simplify its internal accounting arrangements by abolishing the artificial separation between the note issue and central banking functions, and to remove some redundant reporting obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill addresses the fact that penalties for offences against the Banking Act have been unaltered since the Act came into force in 1959 and provides for them to be revised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that the relevant sections of the Act be amended to establish penalties for breaches of the Act or of its regulations which are consistent with penalty levels imposed on corporations in other significant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, and I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would implement administrative assessment of child support obligations under a formula set out in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It would implement stage 2 of the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would have an entirely prospective operation-affecting only people who separate or have a child born on or after its commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> Under stage 2 of the child support scheme:</PARA>
<PARA> Procedures to obtain child support would be dramatically simplified;</PARA>
<PARA> The level of child support obtained would be directly in line with the capacity of parents to provide it;</PARA>
<PARA> There would be annual updating of child support levels;</PARA>
<PARA> The processes of application for sole parents pension and child support would be closely integrated;</PARA>
<PARA> The rights of parents to apply to the courts to resolve disputes in their particular case would be retained;</PARA>
<PARA> The facilities for parents to make private agreements between themselves about child support would be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the need for reform of child maintenance was identified by the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. In 1980, only 4 years after the commencement of the Family Law Act that Committee identified four key problems with the system of child maintenance:</PARA>
<PARA> The levels of maintenance were inadequate;</PARA>
<PARA> The enforcement of maintenance liabilities was ineffective;</PARA>
<PARA> The system of updating child maintenance liabilities was cumbersome and seldom used;</PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance and social security systems were poorly integrated. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of child maintenance the Joint Select Committee's major recommendation was the implementation of a scheme under which the amount a liable parent should contribute would be administratively assessed in line with his or her capacity to pay. This contribution would have gone to the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience in other countries has shown such schemes to have limited effectiveness-only the revenue benefits so neither parent has any reason to assist in administration of the scheme. Intrusive and expensive mechanisms are, therefore, required to make them work. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, because such schemes operate only where a custodian is in receipt of pension, difficulties arise when the custodians find work or repartner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government, therefore, has not fully endorsed the approach of the Joint Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine it was for similar reasons that the Fraser Government did not act to implement this aspect of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Joint Select Committee reported the next major development was the establishment by the then Attorney-General, Senator Evans, of the National Maintenance Enquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> That enquiry recommended in 1985 the establishment of a national maintenance collection agency to improve the enforcement of maintenance orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Following work by the Family Law Council the Government decided not to proceed with the National Maintenance Collection Agency because it would not have addressed the issues of:</PARA>
<PARA> Levels of maintenance;</PARA>
<PARA> Updating of liabilities; or</PARA>
<PARA> Interaction of the maintenance and social security systems. </PARA>
<PARA> A more fundamental reform that synthesised the best of both the Select Committee report and National Maintenance Enquiry report was required-a reform that adopted the principles of administrative assessment, integrated private and public provision for children and achieved effective collection of liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government published ``Child Support: A Discussion Paper on Maintenance''. It proposed a system of:</PARA>
<PARA> Setting of child support levels under the formula related to the income of parents;</PARA>
<PARA> Initial assessment under that formula to be by the child support agency-part of the tax office;</PARA>
<PARA> Access to the courts in contentious cases;</PARA>
<PARA> Annual updating of assessment by the child support agency; and</PARA>
<PARA> Collection of child support liabilities by the child support agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Following extensive public consultation the Minister for Social Security announced in March 1987 the introduction of the Child Support Scheme in two stages. </PARA>
<PARA> Under stage 1 of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1988, maintenance orders and agreements made, registered or approved in the courts can be enforced by the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> In his March 1987 statement the Minister announced that he would establish the Child Support Consultative Group to advise the Government on a legislative formula to apply under stage 2. </PARA>
<PARA> The group, chaired by Justice Fogarty of the Family Court of Australia, was established in May 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would substantially implement the report of the Child Support Consultative Group: ``Child Support: Formula for Australia''. </PARA>
<PARA> In describing the formula which would be implemented by this Bill, Justice Fogarty said:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The formula preserves the right of parents to reach their own agreement (with suitable protection for the revenue when the custodial parent is on a pension or benefit);</PARA>
<PARA> It ensures that each parent has an unqualified right to have the matter determined by the court if he/she is not satisfied with the administrative assessment. It continues the right to go to court but will remove the need to do so in many cases;</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time it provides for the automatic updating of orders annually in accordance with any changes in the financial or other circumstances of the parties;</PARA>
<PARA> The percentages which have been chosen have regard to evidence of the proportion of income ordinarily spent on children who live with both parents and are aimed at achieving reasonable levels of orders proportional to income;</PARA>
<PARA> This approach, combined with the enforcement procedures already established under stage 1, should go a long way towards overcoming the unsatisfactory state of child support in Australia and benefit both Australian children and the Australian community generally.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, under the Bill administrative assessment of child support would be available to people having the ongoing daily care of a child from the natural or adoptive parents of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would apply only when the parents have a child born on or after the commencement of stage 2 of the scheme or the parents separate on or after that day; and provided that the applicant is not cohabiting with the parent against whom the claim is made. </PARA>
<PARA> In all other cases maintenance rights and liabilities will continue to be determined under the Family Law Act. For example applications by children in their own right would remain under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Following an application, the child support agency could proceed to issue an assessment against a person only if the person was a party to a marriage during which the child was born; the person has adopted the child; or the agency is satisfied that under the law of the Commonwealth, a state, territory or prescribed overseas jurisdiction:</PARA>
<PARA> the person is recorded as a parent of the child on a register of births or parentage;</PARA>
<PARA> a court has found as a fact that the person is a parent of the child; or</PARA>
<PARA> the person has acknowledged paternity of the child in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> The parties would be entitled to have any dispute about eligibility for assessment-such as parentage-decided by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Where an applicant is entitled to assessment under the Bill the basic formula to be applied by the child support agency would be: the income of the liable parent minus the liable parent's exemption multiplied by the relevant child support percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the assessment the income of the parents will be the taxable income of each parent in the financial year ending on 30 June in the calendar year preceding the assessment. This would be adjusted by a factor prescribed by regulation to take account of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The liable parent's exemption would make provision for the support of the liable parent and any natural or adoptive children of whom the liable parent has ongoing daily care. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with recommendations of the child support consultative group the level of the exemption will be fixed according to the level of social security pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> The group recommended, and the Bill would provide, that where a liable parent does not have the ongoing daily care of natural or adoptive children the exemption would be equivalent to single adult rate pension; and where there are natural or adoptive children the exemption would be equivalent to the maximum rate pension payable to a married couple plus the additional pension that would be payable in the social security system for each of those children. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with this principle the Bill would provide that where a liable parent is caring for a 16 or 17 year old child additional allowance of 25% of pension payable to a married couple would be made for that child. This is close to the rate at which Austudy is payable for children of that age. </PARA>
<PARA> The child support percentages provided for in the Bill are as recommended by the child support consultative group. They would vary with the number of children in respect of whom child support is paid: for one child, 18%; for two children, 27%; for three children 32%; for four children 34% and for 5 or more children 36%. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending these percentages the consultative group noted:</PARA>
<PARA> ``In determining appropriate percentage levels to apply above (the liable parent's exemption) available evidence that might indicate the proportion of family income normally devoted to children in a two parent family was taken as a starting point. However in arriving at percentage contribution rates a number of other factors need to be taken into consideration. These include additional costs of rearing a child where parents do not live together, indirect costs of children to custodial parents, access costs incurred by non-custodial parents, retention of appropriate incentives to earn for non-custodial parents and the views of the community on what would be considered a fair level of child support.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that, taken together, the exemption levels and percentages recommended by the consultative group produce a fair and equitable formula for child support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would provide, in line with the recommendations of the child support consultative group, that the income of a custodial parent would be taken into account under the formula when it exceeds the sum of average weekly earnings and an allowance for child care costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of liability of a liable parent would be reduced having regard to the amount of this excess. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the basic formula contained in this Bill would achieve a fair assessment of child support liabilities in the great majority of cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would make provision for a range of more complex cases such as where ongoing care of a child is shared between parents or where care of the children from one family is split between parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Other cases dealt with are where a child is cared for by a person who is not a parent of the child and both parents are liable to pay child support: and cases where one liable parent is liable to pay child support to two or more custodians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would also make provision to take account of the changed circumstances of the parties such as changes in income or care arrangements for the child. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill would enable the continuance of private agreements about the amount and form of child support through a mechanism along the lines of section 86 of the Family Law Act. An agreement on child support matters in writing and signed by both parents could be registered with the child support agency. Registration would make provisions of the agreement enforceable and variable as if they were provisions of consent orders of a court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would also retain the rights of parties to approach courts in child support matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill the courts that exercise jurisdiction under the Family Law Act would have four functions. </PARA>
<PARA> First, they would determine applications for declarations that an applicant is, or is not, entitled to an assessment under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the courts would determine whether an assessment by the child support agency is, on the facts of the particular case, a correct application of the formula contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the courts would determine applications to vary assessments in cases where assessments in line with the formula would not produce a fair result. </PARA>
<PARA> To obtain a variation from a formula assessment an applicant to a court would be required to establish that the case falls within specified grounds for departure. </PARA>
<PARA> These grounds for departure broadly relate to cases where: first, a parent's capacity to provide support for a child is reduced by special needs or commitments of the parent or another person the parent has a legal duty to support; second, where the costs of supporting a child are affected because of the special needs of the child or because the child is being cared for, educated or trained in the manner that was expected by his or her parents or because of the high costs of access of either parent to the child; and, third, where the assessment is inequitable because the income, earning capacity, property or financial resources of either parent or of the child which have not been taken into account as ``income'' under the formula or because earlier payments and transfers or settlements of property made by the liable parent to the child, the eligible custodian or to a third person for the benefit of the child would mean that the formula assessment does not produce a fair result. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing whether to vary an assessment the courts would consider in each case the nature of the duty of the parents to support their children, the proper needs of the child, the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child and the parents, the commitments of each parent necessary to support him or herself or any other person that the person has a duty to maintain, the direct and indirect costs incurred by the custodian in providing care for the child, the relative hardship to the custodian or non custodian and their children in the particular case and whether, despite the clear primacy of the duty of parents to support their children, it is proper to make an order that could increase payments to the custodian under the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the fourth function of the courts under the Bill would be to order that child support be provided in a form other than periodic amounts. A court would be required to state, when making an order that child support is to be provided in a form other than periodic amounts, whether child support ordered is to be credited against liability under an assessment and to give reasons for making the order and the statement. A court's power to make orders for child support in a form other than periodic amounts would be subject to the right of custodians who are pensioners to apply at any time to the child support agency for their entitlements to periodic amounts not to be reduced by more than 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill would also:</PARA>
<PARA> restate the availability of the counselling facilities of the Family Court or a Family Court of a State to parties involved in the administrative assessment process;</PARA>
<PARA> provide a secrecy provision to balance the need to protect the confidentiality of tax information and other information necessarily obtained in the administration of the scheme as it relates to each parent, with the need for all parties to be aware of the matters taken into account by the child support agency when making an assessment; and</PARA>
<PARA> consequential amendments to the Child Support Act, the Family Law Act, the Social Security Act and the Taxation Administration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support Scheme has seen a unique display of unity of purpose among all legislators in Australia. Legislation for stage 1 of the Child Support Scheme passed through both Houses of this Parliament with unanimous support. Its full operation depends upon legislation passed by the parliaments of all six states. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would provide for stage 2 to operate pursuant to Commonwealth powers and pursuant to the reference of powers already made by Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. Queensland and Western Australia would be able to have it fully operate in their states through a reference of power, adoption of the legislation or making a corresponding law that the Commonwealth agrees to have apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government looks forward to full national application of this legislation through these mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> We also hope that we will retain the unity of purpose within this Parliament on this most important area. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By now it is old news that on 16 August the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) sent members and senators a letter indicating that the Government had decided to increase the postage entitlement for members of the House of Representatives to $30,525 and to leave that of senators at $9,000. This attempt by the Government to change the administrative arrangements for postal allowances for senators and members is, in my view, nothing more than members of the Executive getting caught with their hands in the till-the whole lot of them with both hands in the till-to advance their own positions and the position of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With that in mind I seek to make some remarks with respect to the reply tabled this morning by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray. The reply tabled this morning is totally inadequate in terms of addressing the concerns raised by the Opposition. It simply, in effect, restates the letter. It says, `We have decided this is what we are going to do. Take it or leave it; like it or lump it'. It gives no consideration to the real issues involved. I put it to the Senate that once a determination has been made by the Remuneration Tribunal it has force of law. That is reasonably clear from section 7 (5) of the Remuneration Tribunals Act, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>A determination of the Tribunal shall be in writing and shall come into operation, or shall be deemed to have come into operation, on such date as the Tribunal specifies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>For this particular determination-for the stamp allowance that senators and members alike have been getting up to 16 August-that was a date in January this year. That determination would have life-force of law, if you like-until a new determination was made. That is how the system has worked for many years. A Minister is now purporting to change that determination by simply sending around a letter. If we have come to that-if we bother to spend however much we do spend on the Remuneration Tribunal and the Government then decides it does not want to go along with that but can just send around a letter-it makes a total farce of bothering to have a Remuneration Tribunal in the first place. Secondly, it shows that the Government has no understanding of the force that Tribunal determinations have. That is probably no surprise to members and senators on the Opposition of the Parliament. But it does more than that. It gives us a glimpse of how this Government wants to conduct itself in the lead-up to the next election. As you, Mr Acting Deputy President, being a Government senator, will understand, this side of the Parliament needs to win 12 lower House seats in order to retain government. An extra $20,000 in postage entitlements to those seats is obviously a particular advantage to the Government members who now hold them. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have now is a situation where coalition candidates in seats will not have $30,000 worth of postage, but by virtue of a simple ministerial letter the sitting Labor member in those seats will have $30,000 worth of postage. That is what this whole move is about. There is no reassessment of priorities for lower House members as against senators; it is a reassessment of the Government's priorities, a reassessment of its chances of whether it can get back or not. That is the beginning and the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if we want to look at it a bit closer we ask ourselves: what does it mean if the Government gets back? It means that Ministers who might be sitting opposite and Ministers who might be in the lower chamber have got a chance of being Ministers for a bit longer. We all know what self-interest that entails. If it was a minor matter involving not much money and it was agreed by most people, on its face, to be a mistake or to be perhaps an intentional bending of the rules but in the interest of the nation as a whole or a particular group across party lines, one might understand it. One might say one was being a bit pedantic trying to insist that the rules were followed. But when one can see that the reason the rules have been broken, chucked out of the window, totally ignored, and wiped away by one simple letter is to advance the position of the Government, and in particular to advance the position of front bench members, we have to ask whether it is appropriate that the rules have been broken and not enough people seem to be complaining about it. The media do not seem to be very interested in the fact that this is a hands in the till, snout in the trough job to advance the Government's own position. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard today a small response by the Minister, Senator Robert Ray, to the limited debate we were able to have on this matter this morning. I had to pinch myself and wonder whether I was possibly going insane, because what we have had, what has been outlined in this chamber by a number of people, is a Minister--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was your conclusion?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That I am not insane, Minister; that was my conclusion. I did not even need to think about it. What we have had is a ministerial letter trying to throw out a Remuneration Tribunal decision. The Government has thought about that, quite obviously. Senator Ray indicated that in his speech last week. The Government thought about it and decided it could do it. What does he have the gall to stand up here and tell senators today? Let me read what he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I put my comments on the record when this issue was first raised. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, he did. And when he did that he indicated that the Government had given consideration to this matter and believed it could do what it had done. Then he says:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time I have actually been asked in this chamber in all the hyberbole that has gone on to take the matter up. Senator Macklin has invited me to take up with Mr West the question as to whether the whole matter should be referred to the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>So where have we come in the last week? We have a letter from the Government saying, `It is out of the Remuneration Tribunal's hands, we are going to handle all this ourselves now', and then an off-the-cuff remark from a Minister saying, `Oh well, I will see if it all should go back to the Remuneration Tribunal'. Who is kidding whom? Is the Minister serious when he said that this morning, or was that meant to be a joke, and are we all meant to burst into laughter and say, `Ha, ha, isn't that funny'? I do not regard it as funny. As I have said, I would not use terminology like `hands in the till' if I did not think it was a very serious matter. The Minister says, `Oh well, I'll see whether we want to go back to the Remuneration Tribunal'. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA> A first-year law student could probably tell us that, once a determination has been made, it stands and the only way it can be changed is by legislation. The Government obviously understands that, because in 1986 a number of senators and members took part in a debate on the Remuneration and Allowances Alteration Bill 1986. That was a Bill to reject a salary determination made by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Government understood at that stage that, in order to change a determination, legislative action had to be taken-a Bill had to be passed. Now we have the situation where the Government, for its own greedy purposes, wants to give lower House members, in particular marginal seat members, $20,000 more postage. It does not want to have a Bill before both chambers of this Parliament to do that because it knows what the debate would produce. It would produce an unholy reaction from the taxpayer. The taxpayers, if more of them realised about this problem, would understand that this Government wants to give $2 a week to pensioners and hundreds and hundreds of dollars a week to members of parliament. That is the explanation that we have for not proceeding via legislation this time-because it would be inconvenient to have debate on the matter. That is why the Government has just tried to slip it through by ministerial letter. Anyway, I have made the point that I do not think that is the appropriate way to go about it, that the Government has not done this the right way, and that it has not given any proper explanation for the course that it has chosen to take. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further matter, that is, parliamentary scrutiny of what the Executive is doing. After all, that is presumably what Parliament is meant to be about. Parliament looks at what the Government does, keeps a check on the Government and, in that sense, keeps a check on members of the Executive, who in this instance, as I have indicated, have got their hands very firmly in the till to the tune of $20,000 for each of their marginal seats. How can we do that? We can keep a check on the Government and Executive by watching what legislation they want to pass and, to the extent that something does not come up in legislation, check on it in appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> It has long been settled-since 1965, I understand-that new policies not authorised by special legislation would be in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). There was a reason for that-a simple reason. It is to alert Parliament, in particular the Senate, to the fact that the Government is doing something new so that we can have a look at it and can exercise our right to amend that Bill, to set that matter apart from those matters contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the ordinary annual services of government. That is why it should be in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Any decision, albeit a grossly improper decision, to spend money not authorised by special legislation should be in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA> For the Government to decide that, by simple ministerial letter, it can completely dispose of the Remuneration Tribunal is obviously a new policy-and it, therefore, should be in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). But what does this Government do? It denies Parliament, it denies the Senate, the opportunity to scrutinise what it has been doing by slipping the matter-that is, the appropriation for it, the grant of money-into Appropriation Bill (No. 1). We can look at the Estimates for the Department of Administrative Services and ask, `Where could this possibly be?' The examination of estimates is not meant to be a cat and mouse game; it is not meant to be `hide it if you can' on the Government's part, and `find it if you can' on the Opposition's part. It is meant to be a sensible, bipartisan appraisal of what the Executive is wanting to do. That is the whole purpose of it; it is not a game. If we wanted to play games, we could go out and buy Monopoly boards. It is meant to be a sensible appraisal of what the Government is doing, a sensible outline to Parliament so that officers of departments can given explanations as to what is intended. Everybody is meant to have a better understanding of what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind, we head off to the Department of Administrative Services to see where this money is and we find that it is under `Property Operating Expenses', subprogram 14.1. I will almost guarantee that the telephone bills for members and senators are not under `Property Operating Expenses'. That is not where stamps belong. Stamps for members of parliament under `Property Operating Expenses'! That should highlight how ludicrous this matter is. It is a case of those in government realising that they want to give themselves some extra money-and I say that advisedly-and then wanting to get away with it and so choosing a course that has the minimum oversight by Parliament. They do that, firstly, by not using an Act of Parliament to do something that they should use an Act of Parliament for and that there should be proper debate on so that the public are therefore aware of what their Parliament is doing and how the Executive is spending the taxpayers' dollar. The Government decides that it will not do that; that it will just send around a ministerial letter. Government by ministerial letter! This Government is famous for government by press release. Now it will be famous for government by ministerial letter. The Government thinks we cannot do much about that. Then, having decided to take that action, the Government chooses to place the appropriation for the funds into an appropriation Bill that cannot be amended by this chamber, totally emasculating this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no surprise at all that this Government does not want to give the Senate the opportunity to scrutinise what it does. Although I do not really believe it, I had mistakenly thought that the Remuneration Tribunal was meant to be the independent body to deal with these matters. Senator Macklin, in speaking earlier to this matter, properly identified the reason that we send our salaries and allowances to the Remuneration Tribunal. Let me outline, for anybody it has not dawned upon yet or for whom the penny has not dropped as to the reason for doing that, that it is to keep parliamentarians' snouts out of the trough. That is why we do it-for the public to have some confidence that the money spent on parliamentarians' salaries and allowances is not being fixed up by us behind closed doors, without parliamentary scrutiny. So, we send those matters off to an independent body. Senator Macklin rightly raised the point that a massive increase in allowances from $9,000 to $30,525 is simply being granted by ministerial letter. There was no independent scrutiny. Chuck the Remuneration Tribunal out the window. Let us all get our fingers in the till. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh should know something about this. He often stands up in this chamber and accuses members of the public in general of having their fingers in the till. I would be very pleased to hear what he has to say about this Government move, which has not only the Government's hands in the till but also the Executive's hands in the till. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the concept of separating new policies not authorised by special legislation is not simply a function of a compact between the Executive and the Senate settled in 1965. This matter was re-endorsed in June 1976 by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in a unanimous report on the ordinary annual services of government. </PARA>

<PARA>Parliament is not that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a return made by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) today in regard to a motion by Senator Lewis as to the entitlements for postage allowances that have been determined by the Government for members of the House of Representatives. The motion that was put by Senator Lewis on 17 August 1989 called for particular details. I reiterate those requests. They were to explain in detail the reasoning behind the Government's decision to increase postal entitlement; to indicate why the Government chose to ignore the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal in its 1988 Review that members of parliament generally be provided with access to the full range of postal services provided by Australia Post subject to an annual limit of $9,000; and to explain why it is considered that while a significant increase in the existing postage entitlements of members of the House of Representatives is necessary with immediate effect, senators should continue to receive their existing entitlement indexed to changes in the mailing rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The response handed down today does not address those fundamental questions that were asked by the Senate. If we look at the reply that Senator Ray tabled earlier today, we find that, in respect of the request to explain in detail the reasoning, we have four brief paragraphs just setting out basically the facts. With regard to the second request, asking the Government to explain why it chose to ignore the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal, we basically have a very simple, stupid statement that just reiterates the facts the Remuneration Tribunal has offered. Thirdly, the area relating to the difference between the Senate and the House of Representatives is dealt with by the Government in an almost idiotic manner, in the way in which it has chosen to give an excuse for the decision it has taken with regard to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The point has been well made by Senator Vanstone, speaking before me, that it is very obvious that the Government is looking after its own political interests in this regard. It is choosing very deliberately to take over functions that in the past properly have been exercised by the Remuneration Tribunal. We need to ask why Senator Ray's statement says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has on 20 July 1989 and pursuant to subsection 7 (4) (b) of the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1983 withdrawn the matter from the Tribunal's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Why then did we not hear about this decision in this Parliament for almost a month from when that matter was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal? It poses a very serious question as to why the Government took action one month before it announced its retrospective application of granting a postal allowance of $30,525 to members of the House of Representatives. That the Government has chosen not only to withdraw this matter from the consideration of the Remuneration Tribunal where it very properly rests, but also to do it in such an underhand and sneaky manner, should be a matter of very major concern for this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the argument about the allocation for postage, let us look at the answer given with regard to paragraph (c), which seeks to justify these increases for members of the House of Representatives. The Government argues that this would enable a member of the House of Representatives to send a letter once a year to each constituent in an average sized electorate. I would argue that $30,525 will do much more than that. Anyone who can do simple arithmetic can work out the postage that will be available to House of Representatives members, particularly given the bulk postage arrangements now offered by Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the idiotic and stupid explanation given by the Government as to why it cannot give a similar allowance to members of the Senate is that the costs would vary from $1.1m for senators from New South Wales to-and this is very interesting-a bottom line of $24,057 for a senator from the Northern Territory, that is, for Senator Collins or me, which points out the idiocy of the whole damned argument. Why is Warren Snowdon, the Northern Territory member of the House of Representatives, using the Government's very argument to be given a postage allowance of $30,525, when the Government argues that if it is to put the same principles into place that it has argued for members of the House of Representatives, then senators for the Northern Territory would receive some $6,000 less than Mr Snowdon?</PARA>
<PARA> I think it has been implied by other speakers in this debate that this is nothing but a ploy for marginal seats. The Government is switching the cost of campaigning in those marginal seats straight on to the taxpayers, rather than having the honesty to say that those costs are something that the Australian Labor Party-or any other political party-should pick up where it is directly involved in those matters. It is a matter of very serious concern that the Government has given us a flippant and totally inadequate response on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that we are debating the matter of the arbitrary, unilateral and peremptory decision of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) to increase the stamp allowance for members of the House of Representatives from $9,000 to in excess of $30,000. The first question which rests uncomfortably in my mind is what has brought on this decision at this time in this arbitrary fashion. Of course, the answer is to be found in the polls. This decision has been stimulated by the panic of this Government-this tired, directionless, failing Government-which is clinging to the last vestige of hope for re-election. Searching around in a state of panic, the Government has drawn the conclusion that it has to develop a closer communication with the public. It has decided that to do that it will significantly increase the stamp allowance for members of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason the increase is limited to the House of Representatives is that the Government has a majority of a score. The advantage for the Government is that more constituents will receive mail from Labor members of parliament than from Liberal members of parliament. It is designed as a direct marketing program, no doubt compatible with the Government's newly found knowledge it has acquired from its computer in regard to demography and other information regarding electorates. Labour House of Representatives members will be able to make direct contact with members of the electorate in quite specific and carefully calculated ways so as to persuade constituents to vote for the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook informs me, quite properly, that at the last election the Government was voted into office. The truth of the matter is that that is retrospective. Prospectively, the Government is in very real trouble. The polls are telling the Government that, as at today, it cannot win the next election, so what does it do? Government members resort to putting their snouts in the taxpayers' tough to recover the advantage that is presently to be found with the Opposition, and that is to be found through this grubby method of the Minister providing this gratuitous allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might ask the rhetorical question: Why has the same benefit not been given to the Senate? I am not advocating this position; it is a rhetorical question. The answer is to be found in the same numbers. The truth is that in the House of Representatives the Government has a majority of about a dozen-for the moment. In the Senate it is represented, at various levels of competence and capacity, by but 32 senators. Out of a total number of 76, we find that there are 34 members of the Opposition, three Independents and seven Democrats. If the Senate were to have the same allocation, the majority of people receiving mail as a result would be people who do not vote for the Labor Party. The majority of people would be receiving information from senators who would not be putting forward the Labor Party's position. That is the cold, cruel truth of the Labor Party's ambitions in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by the Hon. Stewart West, the Minister for Administrative Services, that it is the Government's view that members of the House of Representatives, `who traditionally are in much closer relationship with their constituents, should have an increased capacity to communicate directly with them'. We have a Minister of the Crown telling the Parliament that there is some special intrinsic relationship between the voters and members of the House of Representatives that does not exist between-senators and their electors. One imagines that there is some archaic view locked away somewhere in the mind of the Minister that senators are in some way appointed by State governments-as if we are not responsible to the electorate, as if we do not respond to them, as if we are not elected by them, as if we do not represent them, as if we are not accountable to them. That demonstrates the distance this Government is removed from an understanding of how the democratic process operates. I will give the Senate an old example, which will not be relevant at the next election. Try telling Senator Vallentine that at the last election she was elected in spite of the fact that she was not to have any special relationship with her constituency. Try telling the Australian Democrats that they were elected in spite of having a benign relationship with their constituents. Try telling me that. I was elected in 1980 with a majority of just over 100 votes-the finest majority of any senator ever elected to this chamber. I was told by my colleagues in the party room that they had marginal seats and that I had a safe seat. Perhaps that is the general mentality of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the Senate that any senator who is not sensitive to the aspirations, the wishes, the desires and the views of his constituents is not doing his job. Yet clearly that is the view of the Government as if in some obscure, peculiar way senators are isolated from the main stream of public opinion, isolated from the views of their constituents. Every election we notice more and more that special, singular, specific and expensive campaigns are run by all the parties, particularly for the Senate. If communities were not responsive to their senators, would they waste the money? Of course they would not. Putting the political and pragmatic reality aside, I find it the height of absurdity and impertinence that a Minister of the Crown can put to the Senate in a statement that a special relationship exists between the constituents of the members of the House of Representatives that does not prevail in the Senate. It clearly shows an abysmal understanding of the Westminster system and the relationship that the senators have with their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that it is the view that the members of the House of Representatives should have an increased capacity to communicate directly with their constituents. Nobody is talking about the capacity of members of the public to communicate with their members; it is all about the members having the capacity to communicate with their constituents. Nobody is talking about the cost of 41c for little old Betty Balger to write to her member, or the cost of a telephone call, or the increasing cost of transport to see her member. No-one seems particularly concerned about that. We are primarily concerned with the $3.185m needed for the members of the House of Representatives to communicate with their electorate. This is an absurd proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard one member of the Senate stand up with conviction or feeling and say that this proposition is put to us in an altruistic way. All of the Government senators sit there with a sly, smug look on their faces, knowing that it was a slippery threat introduced by this Government to enhance its prospects at the next election. At the end of the day I have to say that they will be found wanting and that they will fail. I find it remarkable that the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, was able to sit here for the period he did, totally insensitive to the cost of this item when he, in the most impertinent and improper way, had the audacity to write to the President of the Senate as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing and say that he was lopping $1.65m from the budget for the Department of the Senate without giving a reasonable or fair explanation except to say that it was the responsibility of the Government to raise revenue and the right of the Government to determine expenditure. He ignored the fact, of course, that it is the Parliament that raises the revenue. It is the Parliament that spends it, not the Executive Government and, least of all, Senator Walsh. Senator Walsh is telling us that the Department of the Senate can be trimmed by another $1.65m. If that means inadequate staff for select committees or standing committees seeking to inquire into legislation proposed by this Government, so be it. In other words, Senator Walsh is telling the Senate that he cares not whether the Senate is able to fulfil its functions at the same time as he is approving the expenditure of nearly $4m so that members of the House of Representatives can contact their constituents. It is rank hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I find it horrific that this Government has previously sought, through the appropriate and proper channels, to persuade the Tribunal that there is merit in the argument that is now manifesting itself through this edict. The Government has been to the umpire and put the arguments. It has sought to persuade the Tribunal that there is justification for this item but it has had its case rejected. It is horrific that it then says, `We don't like the umpire's decision. We're going to go ahead with the game plan anyway'. It is a cynical and, in my view, a very sick proposition by a government which in retrospect will be seen as rotten to the core in terms of its desperate endeavours to cling to offers at a time when it should be ignominiously dumped. </PARA>

However, it is not just by the fiat of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) that members are treated disproportionately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I advise the Senate that at the last round of the Remuneration Tribunal hearings I made what I thought was a very persuasive application for certain members of this Parliament to be provided with four-wheel drive vehicles. I am referring to a very limited number who service wild and woolly electorates-the last frontiers-and there are a number of us around. As Senator Grant Tambling said tonight quite correctly, in the case of the Northern Territory senators we behave and operate, in terms of constituents, precisely as members of the House of Representatives do. In the case of Senator Tambling, he is the only conservative Federal member of Parliament and is likely to remain so for a considerable period I might add. Therefore, the load on him is quite great. I put my submission-and all the reasons were based on my experience in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly where such vehicles were provided to us-of the dangerous nature of relying on vehicles from hire-car companies which turn out not to have spare tyres, that have 50,000 hard kilometres on the clock, that have no radios. To break down 400 kilometres across Arnhem Land without a radio with nothing in either direction is a dangerous position to be in. The need to have one's own vehicle and to service it is, I thought, a very persuasive submission. </PARA>
<PARA> I was telephoned afterwards by a certain person who said, `The Tribunal was very impressed by your arguments about the four-wheel drive vehicle and was entirely persuaded by it. You can expect some good news in the mail'. I put up the written submission. I supported it by oral evidence to the Remuneration Tribunal and Warren Snowdon got the vehicle. That is wrong. The difficulty for me is that since he got the vehicle I have borrowed it on two occasions to go into Arnhem Land, but I and other members of the Senate, such as Senator Tambling, should have our own vehicles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday 18 August 1989 Donald Kevin Moore died of a heart attack aged 52. Honourable senators will have been on the receiving end of letters and information circulars from Mr Moore. He was in fact the driving force behind the PACT Foundation, the Publicly Accountable Classroom Teaching Foundation. There is no doubt that he was a man committed to championing the pursuit of excellence in education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Donald Moore was born in Leonora in Western Australia on 10 July 1937. Before coming to Canberra in the late 1960s he gained a degree in economics from the University of Western Australia. He also had a Bachelor of Theology degree. After a short career in the Public Service he obtained his Diploma of Education and taught at both the Telopea Park and Kambah high schools before retiring from full-time teaching in 1978 due to ill health. Don will be best remembered as the founder and driving force behind the PACT Foundation whose objectives are to promote accountable classroom teaching, a renewed awareness of the fundamental importance of literacy and numeracy and the restoration of objectivity and credibility to secondary school certificates. Don's championship of the pursuit of excellence through a disciplined approach to learning attracted wide attention in the local and national press. The seminars he promoted on vital educational issues were supported by notable educators and academics. He in turn was guest speaker at many educational forums. He was editor of the PACT Journal which has a wide and varied readership throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Don was a committed Christian, a man of great virtue and an active exponent of the principles of social justice. For many years he was the Pearce parish coordinator for the refugee resettlement scheme and was prominently involved in caring for the Vietnam student residents of Caritas House. It was indeed a fitting tribute to him that so many of Caritas House ex-residents attended his funeral. He was a member of the Knights of the Southern Cross and the St Vincent de Paul Society. Don is survived by his wife Judith and three young children-Jessica, Ivan and Bernadine-to all of whom is extended deep sympathy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on a matter of great concern to many residents of the Hastings Shire on the mid-New South Wales coast. I have to make it clear at the outset that I am not absolutely opposed to coastal development if it is properly planned and inflicts a minimum of damage on the environment and the local community. However, we do have the horrible precedent of the overdeveloped Gold Coast and we are all becoming aware that our coastal environment is a rapidly dwindling but valuable national resource.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The revelations of the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry are not reassuring on the actual process of development application decisions. Vested interests, personal friendships and some suspicious financial transactions all seem to have taken precedence over considerations of financial damage and the best interests of local residents. I should emphasise that members and associates of both the present New South Wales Government and the previous Government have been involved in decisions apparently biased toward sectional interests. An example is the Dunbogan Canal Estate near Laurieton. The proposal canal development has been a long-running saga that dates right back to 1973 and has always attracted a high level of community opposition. The development is on highly sensitive wetlands less than one metre above sea level. It is flood prone land and is bordered by the ocean, the Camden Haven River and sewage treatment works. Quite likely, it would sink beneath its own weight even before the greenhouse effect took its toll on coastal areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982, the council concerned, the Hastings Municipal Council, adopted a flood plain management policy for the area in question. In conjunction with the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning and the New South Wales Department of Public Works, extensive research was carried out and the area was classified as Rural Floodway 1 (A1). In 1983 the Hastings Municipal Council, along with the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning, initiated the Hastings coastal development strategy and residential release program. One of the findings of this strategy plan was:</PARA>
<PARA>Government policy is based on the view that urban development is generally undesirable on any flood prone land if there are alternative flood free sites available. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that other land was available for development. Despite the above decision, in 1986 the Hastings Municipal Council again moved to rezone the land for canal development. After much community outrage, the Council decided on 6 April 1987 to hold a public hearing into the canal development. Commissioner John Woodward, the Chairman of the Office of Commissioners of Inquiry, conducted the public hearing over three days during June 1987 at Laurieton. As far as I am aware, out of the numerous submissions received by Commissioner Woodward only three supported the development. Not surprisingly, one was from the developer, Matt Toussard of Jimneva Properties. The others were from Alderman Daphne Johnston, and Jim O'Brien, Secretary of the Port Macquarie Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim O'Brien is a rather colourful character with alleged connections to the National Civic Council. He has a habit of favouring right-wing unions over militant left-wing unions on building sites, a trait no doubt warmly appreciated by developers in the Port Macquarie area. Given the number of complaints from unions affiliated to the Port Macquarie Council of Trade Unions about O'Brien's methods of operating, one may wonder whether O'Brien's submission reflected the views of all the affiliates. </PARA>
<PARA> In commenting on Alderman Daphne Johnston's submission supporting the development, the business paper to the Community Development Committee meeting of the Hastings Municipal Council dated 6 April 1987 stated that:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the contentious nature of the proposal, it is considered a commissioner of inquiry should be appointed . . . This appears to be the only method to satisfy all the persons making submissions that an independent consideration will be made. </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear from this document that the Council had an open mind about the rezoning proposal and was prepared to accept the umpire's decision. Nevertheless, at least Alderman Johnston had already made up her mind in support of the development. </PARA>
<PARA> In his findings, Commissioner Woodward recommended that the rezoning of land at Dunbogan for canal development not proceed. Some of the main points with which Commissioner Woodward supported his findings were, firstly, that sufficient flood free land was available already in the area for development; secondly, a flood plain management plan should be in place before consideration was given to one-off rezonings; thirdly, the servicing amenities-that is, the sewerage and water connections-had not been adequately addressed by council staff; fourthly, the environmental study and other evidence before the public hearing did not address the potential cumulative impacts of developments on the Camden Haven River; fifthly, the lands concerned were in close proximity to the sewerage treatment works; and sixthly, the proposed development would represent a visual intrusion on the scenic views from North Brother Mountain. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the findings of Commissioner Woodward, the Hastings Municipal Council, in a move that I believe is unprecedented in New South Wales, proceeded with the development. The mayor, Alderman Bob Woodlands, sought to discredit the findings of Commissioner Woodward before the Council had met to discuss them. On 1 December 1987, he stated on regional television:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Commissioner Woodward-</PARA>
<PARA>was given quite a degree of misinformation. There has been a lot of information that he should have considered that he didn't consider and I would also make the comment that maybe the Commissioner's mind was made up before he even started the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement by the mayor was made two weeks before the council even met to discuss the Commissioner's inquiry. Two weeks later on Monday, 14 December, 1987, the Council met and, despite Commissioner Woodward's findings, voted to rezone the land for canal development. The following day Mayor Woodlands apologised to Commissioner Woodward on the ECN8 regional evening news. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the submission made by the Hastings Municipal Council to the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning on the canal development have never been released by either the Council or the Department. It was on the basis of this submission that the New South Wales Minister concerned, Liberal Party member of parliament David Hay, agreed to the rezoning. Despite repeated attempts by the local Camden Haven Protection Society to obtain the document, the Council has hidden behind section 68 of the planning Act, which states that it is not required to release the information. Mind you, the Act does not prevent the Council from releasing the information either. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to withhold the information is a purely political one. Alderman Peter King, a former National Party member of the Legislative Assembly, has stated in the local press that to release the information would be `commercial dynamite'. That was reported in the Port Macquarie News of 27 July 1988. According to Alderman King, `the Council had consistently supported the proposed development'. That being the case, the public hearing by Commissioner Woodward was nothing more than a cynical public relations exercise to con the people of Port Macquarie. Alderman King is not the only member of the Hastings Municipal Council with National Party connections. Mayor Bob Woodlands and Daphne Johnston are also members. Pharmacist John Barrett and Woodlands both threw their hats into the ring for National Party preselection for the State seat of Oxley. Both lost to Bruce Jeffery, who currently holds the seat for the Nationals. The preselection was marred by allegations of branch stacking and vote rigging. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Council's submission to the Department of Environment and Planning for the rezoning of Dunbogan, it is interesting to note that the Council did not forward the submission until May 1988, six months after voting to proceed with the rezoning. Why did it take so long? As honourable senators are no doubt aware, a significant event took place on the New South Wales political scene during that six months. Labor lost government and the Liberals and Nationals took over. Did the Council deliberately put the submission on hold, hoping for a change of government and a more sympathetic hearing? Was the Council told by its friends in the National Party that approval for rezoning would be granted if it won the election? What was contained in the Council's submission to the Department of Environment and Planning that convinced the Minister, David Hay, to find in favour of the rezoning despite the recommendations of Commissioner Woodward? If the evidence is so overwhelming, why has the Council not released the document?</PARA>
<PARA> Further evidence of the National Party's attitude to environmental issues in the Port Macquarie area can be gained from an incident at a National Party fund-raiser held late last year. The following events were related to me by the owner of the Local Leader newspaper, Neil Johnston: Alderman Daphne Johnston asked Deputy Premier Wal Murray about environmental groups getting legal aid. At that time the Camden Haven Protection Society had applied for legal aid for a case before the Land and Environment Court. Its opponents were the Hastings Municipal Council and the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning. Mr Murray stated that he had first heard about the Camden Haven Protection Society's application for legal aid that morning from Mayor Bob Woodlands. Mr Murray went on to say that the Protection Society ought not to have been granted legal aid in order to challenge the Council and that he would look into the matter to see whether he could stop it. Fortunately, he was unsuccessful in his intervention. Interestingly, the secretary of the local branch of the National Party asked Neil Johnston to publish a retraction in the newspaper. As a result of the publication of that story, the local newspaper lost its advertising from the Council and from the services club at Laurieton. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting case involving the Hastings Municipal Council is the proposed bridge over the Hastings River at Settlement Point, Port Macquarie. Like the Dunbogan canal estate, the bridge proposal is surrounded by controversy. The Council, along with some of its supporters in the local media, has claimed that the bridge project is based purely on the need to replace the present ferry service. The Council intends to outlay some $20m of public funds to replace the ferry service, which costs less than $150,000 per annum to run. Currently, there are 120 people living on the north shore of the Hastings River, which means that the bridge proposal works out at a cost of $166,666.66 per person-hardly the sort of cost efficiency that would please Premier Greiner. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Council has repeatedly denied that the true intention of the bridge project is to open up major land holdings for urban development, it stated in a 1986 environmental impact statement that one of the objectives of the bridge proposal was `to remove one constraint to possible future urban and tourist development of the area north of the Hastings River'. According to the Council's 1984 report, the need for the bridge arose from, among other things, `pressure from land owners on the northern side of the Hastings River to permit further development of the area'. As I understand it, there are only four major landowners in that area. According to the report, this land development would accommodate a total population of 20,000 people-15,000 at North Hibbard and 5,000 on the north shore. It was suggested in the report that a bridge across the river would create an `unprecedented boom in the area'. The report even suggested that it would be desirable to review the proposed extensions to the Limeburners Creek nature reserve because `they will have an extremely limiting effect on the future development of Port Macquarie'. It would seem clear that, despite the Council's denials, its plan is to rezone land on the north shore currently zoned for inclusion in the Limeburners Creek nature reserve to urban and tourist development. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1987, R. B. Smyth, Director of the Department of Environment and Planning, examined the Council's environmental impact statement on the bridge and found that there were `serious shortcomings in the EIS which reflected upon the acceptability of the proposal'. In his report, Mr Smyth made 51 direct references over 28 pages to severe inadequacies in the environmental impact statement prepared by the Council. Some of the terms used by Smyth were `inadequate', `unconvincing', `misleading' and `unreliable'. Despite the scathing nature of the assessment, the Council's Chief Engineer offered the Council this advice in a report on 14 December 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>A further option would be to wait until after the next State Election in anticipation of a new State Government adopting a more liberal approach to conservation issues. </PARA>
<PARA>For anyone who had any doubts about where the National Party stood on the issue, Mr Murray said in an election speech at Port Macquarie on 1 March 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>We will bridge the Hastings River and the work will be completed in our first term of office. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Murray went on to say that he was not concerned at the `greenie' opposition to the move and dismissed this as a myth. Clearly, the Council and the National Party intend to open up the north shore of the Hastings River for development and have no intention of preserving the land earmarked for the Limeburners Creek nature reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a close association between Alderman Peter King, a National Party member, and Mr Roger Dulhunty, who has extensive land holdings on the north shore of the Hastings River. Alderman King is a principal of the firm King and Campbell Pty Ltd, which is engaged in surveying, engineering and consultancy on land development in the Hastings area. One of his clients is Mr Dulhunty. Not surprisingly, both are outspoken supporters of the north shore development and the Hastings bridge. While King has in the past declared pecuniary interests in respect of development applications lodged by Dulhunty companies, Alderman King moved and voted in support of a motion at an ordinary Council meeting on 3 April 1989 to grant consent to the filling of wetlands on the Settlement Point peninsula for the proposed bridge. It is not unreasonable to suppose that, should the bridge and the land rezoning go ahead, Alderman King would stand to make money carrying out surveying and consultancy work for Mr Dulhunty on his north shore holdings. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that undue political pressure may have been placed on the Department of Environment and Planning to withdraw or otherwise reassess aspects of the Department's previous director's report. What leads me to consider this possibility is a recent statement by Mayor Bob Woodlands that he had been able personally to `resolve' differences between the Council and the Department of Environment and Planning. Given the scathing attack on the Council in the July 1987 report from the Department of Environment and Planning. I wonder whether Mayor Woodlands used his National Party connections to persuade the new Minister, David Hay, to change the Department's position. </PARA>
<PARA> While collecting information for this debate tonight, I heard a rumour that the Port Macquarie News has promised to `crucify' me if I reveal the facts and the sequence of events that I have just described. I hope that this message has been garbled in transmission. If not, I look forward to my martyrdom. Whether I am around or not, I still say: let the tumbrils of ICAC roll south. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks this evening are directed to address and question some of the comments made by Senator Jenkins over recent months. Unlike Senator Jenkins's practices I have in fact informed her that I will be making these comments and have given her the opportunity to be present in the chamber when I make them. This is in stark contrast to the lack of courtesy that she extended to my colleagues Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Panizza when she made extensive and far-reaching accusations about them in the last sitting week. I am confident that both Senators Crichton-Browne and Panizza do not need me to come in here and defend them. However, there are some important questions and principles that need to be articulated in virtual condemnation of the wild rampage that Senator Jenkins has gone on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, Senator Jenkins in her adjournment speech on 17 August referred to the subject of child migrants and in doing so said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Pearce reiterated to me today that she and other members of the society had previously approached Labor and Liberal members of parliament in Western Australia but these members were not willing to give them support. </PARA>
<PARA>Mistake No. 1. As is so often the case with Senator Jenkins, she is barking up the wrong tree. She has no foundation whatsoever to the comments that she cares to make and has scant regard for whether there is any basis of fact associated with those remarks. After a very careful examination of correspondence files and files dealing with telephone inquiries, I wish to state here quite categorically that I have never received an approach from Mrs Pearce of the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia and that Senator Jenkins is just clearly playing politics in her vicious attempt to push her own rickety barrow down the road to her inevitable defeat, and it cannot happen soon enough. If this is the type of conduct that we can expect from Senator Jenkins from here on until the next election, heaven help us all.</PARA>
<PARA> It actually fascinates me how Senator Jenkins would have any idea whatsoever as to who does or who does not write to me or who does or does not telephone me in my office, both here and in Perth, and yet she has got the gumption to come into the Senate and simply try to score cheap political points without any foundation whatsoever to ingratiate herself with some group in Western Australia. Why would she dare to do that when she would not have a clue what goes on in her own office, let alone what goes on in our offices? But it did not stop her making the accusations. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins went on to accuse my colleague Senator Panizza of various wrong doings, which I might add not only has he refuted strongly here in the Senate but he has also taken appropriate actions should they ever be repeated outside of parliamentary privilege, which of course Senator Jenkins has not been brave enough to do. But Senator Jenkins has also sought to incriminate other Western Australian senators by saying that one or all of us used child labour on family properties. I challenge Senator Jenkins on this occasion to try to be honest and tell the Senate to whom she was referring as her words are directly quoted from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> He is not the only Western Australian senator on whose family property they work. </PARA>
<PARA>Now who was that, Senator Jenkins? Is she game to say who it was or is she going to hide yet again? Senator Jenkins did not refer to a former Western Australian senator; she just referred to Western Australian senators. She was not vague about the accusation at all but it will be interesting to see whether she has the courage of her convictions to stand up in this place and tell the Senate who it is she is accusing, because it is certainly not I. Senators Chaney, Durack and Crichton-Browne, like me, all have family properties but the clear distinction is that they are all suburban home. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us familiar with the people in the Senate can quickly judge for ourselves the absurdity and unfairness of this scurrilous generalisation implicitly accusing unnamed senators of not only employing child migrants but, by extension, of contributing to their neglect and alleged ill-treatment. This holier than thou attitude that Senator Jenkins spruiks off about as if she, and only she, has a mortgage on decency, propriety and honesty, could not be further from the truth. That was clearly demonstrated Friday week ago when the same Senator Jenkins actually came into the Senate and admitted that she had tried to commit what is effectively known as a cardinal sin in the Senate, and that is to try to change Hansard. Her attempt to do that, and it has been clarified--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She did change it, or attempted to?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson has in fact interjected to ask whether she did change it or attempted to. She actually attempted to but Hansard would not allow her to do so. Senator Jenkins's memory, as we all know, is very selective at most times but it would do her well to recall only a few short months ago that there was actually a censure motion moved and carried against a Minister in this place for doing the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could not really even excuse Senator Jenkins on this count of being naive. All she was attempting to do was to change the record that is etched in stone for ever more because she knew that she had not told the truth about Senator Panizza and she had subsequently been caught out. Senator Jenkins also went on to say many other rash, foolish and rather irrational things that same evening. But another which she mentioned which I in fact found quite amusing was that she, Senator Jenkins, was actually accusing the coalition party senators of filling voids because they lacked principles and policies. If this is not the case of the pot calling the kettle black, what is? Come to Western Australia, Mr President, and you will know all about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I can cite the case of a recent delegation that came to Western Australia and was supposed to be briefed by Senator Jenkins on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The members of that delegation left in utter amazement to repeat to other people who they met in further meetings during the course of the week in Western Australia that she could not answer most of their questions. Secondly, she could not provide them with party platforms and policies. Thirdly she had to have her husband, who works for her as her speech writer, according to the West Australian article of 16 August 1989, answer most of their questions in her presence. Even though the Democrats might claim to have policies, one needs to question whether they are worth the paper they are printed on. It is well known to the electorate that their policies are built a bit like a winding road, which in their case simply fits to the camber of the electorate at any given time. They are not based on the responsibility of winning government, because that will never be achieved, thank heavens for Australia. They are simply based on winning a vote at any cost. I think the sad thing is that here is a person who condemns others for not having policies, who cannot enunciate her party's own policies, that is, if they have any. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is certainly not my role nor desire to advise Senator Jenkins, it is timely, considering her very personal attacks on many colleagues in her attempt for survival, to suggest that Senator Jenkins in fact familiarise herself with material prior to attempting to slander others in this place. While I am not prepared simply to say that Senator Jenkins in this instance did not know better, because she should know better, it was quite evident to me, like on so many other occasions, that this has been prepared for her and she is simply the mouthpiece of her speech writer. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, Mr President, I reiterate my challenge to Senator Jenkins that she come into the Senate and she not only apologise to those whom she has maligned but she also apologise for her attempt to ingratiate herself with an organisation by condemning me and others for something of which I know I am not guilty. It is actually Senator Jenkins who must now bear the responsibility for making the question of the child migrants a political play thing. What else can she expect when she uses cases of genuine individual unhappiness to make unsubstantiated allegations against colleagues? I think it is very sad that she has used that organisation because I do not think anyone in this place would deny the fact that there has been quite genuine individual unhappiness among many people, but it is a shame that Senator Jenkins sought to make it such a play thing and sought to malign so many others. </PARA>
<PARA> Bear in mind, Mr President, as I said before, that Senator Jenkins did not even refer to former Western Australian senators, quite apart from the fact that this would have been equally unfair to most recent former senators from the Liberal Party whom I have known. It rings distinctly hollow for Senator Jenkins to expect us to believe here denials that her irresponsible and unsubstantiated slurs do not constitute using this issue as an electoral bandwagon and that she has not sensationalised a matter that may constitute tragedy for individuals, but does not create a class of villains. I hope that, if Senator Jenkins has the courage to apologise, she will also give a commitment to the Senate and to the electorate of Western Australia that she will cease spreading untruths about other people in an attempt to extend her cheap political exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been given every reason to question the sincerity of someone who, at best, is content to make irresponsible statements without checking the facts and, at worst, has sought to create a false impression that coalition senators bear some vague responsibility for actions taken 30 or 40 years ago. I might add that 30 or 40 years ago I did not even live in Western Australia. Thirty years ago I was eight; 40 years ago, therefore, I was not even born. Simple arithmetic cannot even save Senator Jenkins in this instance. It is very sad that Senator Jenkins has put across a very tragic issue in such an uncaring manner. I strongly resent and deny implications that I refused to help constituents on this question. Senator Jenkins needs to learn some very elementary facts about courtesy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the matter of Tasmanian listings for World Heritage. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Graham Richardson, has stated that he expects these listings to be finalised this week because `he has other things to do'. Does the honourable senator believe that by magic he can suddenly complete the arrangements for Tasmania's latest nominations for extending the World Heritage area by next week? By setting such an early and arbitrary deadline, he is causing dire consequences for Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned that the Minister is causing the State Government to rush the nomination for these listings. That must not be allowed to happen. The decisions will have enormous economic and social consequences for the future of our State. Senator Richardson should allow adequate time for proper consideration and for correct decisions to be made. The areas to be listed have not even been publicly released. An aura of secrecy surrounds the entire affair, despite the State Labor Government's promise of open government. Neither Mr Field nor the independent candidates in Tasmania are saying what the boundaries are to be. Neither side is prepared to say even where they differ on World Heritage issues-and they do differ. According to the Hobart Mercury of today's date, there are growing tensions over the unresolved World Heritage nominations between the Greens and the Field Government. We now find that Senator Richardson wants a decision from a government which cannot make up its mind and which has not yet published the areas to be nominated. Tasmanians need to know what areas are involved and what mineral, forestry and hydro resources they contain. These new boundaries are to be finalised by tomorrow and then handed on to Canberra next week so that they can reach the World Heritage Committee in Paris by 15 September. </PARA>
<PARA> Once these areas go on to the World Heritage listing they will be taken out of the State Government's hands and put into the Federal Government's hands. As Geoff Howe of the Tasmanian High Country Trial Riders Association stated:</PARA>
<PARA> They talk about selling Queensland to the Japanese, but we are just giving these areas away. </PARA>
<PARA>It is disgraceful. Large areas of Tasmania may be locked up without parliamentary approval and without a mandate from the Tasmanian people. Mr Field made no mention of further World Heritage listings during the election campaign in Tasmania. His plans were formed only afterwards as part of his deal with the Green independents, so we have no idea of the resources that these areas contain. Mr Max Buchanan, the Chairman of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is sheer madness to give away large tracts of Tasmania without knowing their true economic value to the State. </PARA>
<PARA>By the end of this week up to 20 per cent of Tasmania will be already locked up or nominated for World Heritage listing. Senator Richardson should delay requiring the nominations until thorough studies have been made and the land users consulted. There could not possibly be adequate assessment of the impact on resource industries or public recreation. Any mistakes will not be able to be put right, as control would have been handed over to the Federal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Cook because some of his observations may prove to be a little astray in relation to mining areas in the State, but perhaps that should wait a little while. The Federal Government's own Bureau of Mineral Resources has also made a plea for a comprehensive study of mineral potential to be made before any new areas are to be locked up anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An area of grave concern is the probably listing of the central plateau. This area is being considered by the Labor-Green accord as a matter of priority. Included in this area are large sections of land which are presently used for agricultural and rural purposes. The area extends from South Mole Creek west to the Mersey River, north to Mayberry Road, and south to the Western Tiers. I have had representations from quite a large number of constituents whose rural properties are in this area. They are concerned that there has been no consultation with them about their properties. There are unanswered issues and questions concerning how, for example, their properties could be transferred and how the owners could be compensated. If the central plateau is to be put on Senator Richardson's list without prior consultation with the owners, what sort of society do we live in? Can a person's property just be snatched away without parliamentary approval, without parliamentary debate? The central plateau cannot be considered in the same light as the Franklin River because not all of it is a wilderness, if the definition of the World Heritage Committee is taken. Its definition of a wilderness area is:</PARA>
<PARA>A large tract of entirely natural country . . . (that) allows(s) natural evolution to continue with little disturbance from modern humanity. Major biological processes can be maintained. Rare and endangered species are safeguarded by their remoteness from destructive activities. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that the central plateau is a multi-use area and should be kept that way. The Aborigines used it as part of their hunting grounds and often put fires through it. The area already has a horse riding code of practice which the High Country Trail Riders Association abides by. The Association works for the preservation of horse trails in Tasmania and encourages riders and others to protect and conserve native flora and fauna. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Richardson wishes to continue to insist upon receiving the World Heritage list by early next week it will cause great economic and social hardship for Tasmanians individually and as a whole. For example, a large part of the area is made up of productive rural land. Some of the farmers involved own thousands of acres. If they decided to sell their land and break it into parcels of about 50 acres for the hippies, what would that do to World Heritage prospects? Would they be allowed to change the land use? Would they be restricted in the way they conduct their agricultural pursuits? The Tasmanian Ministers are not prepared to answer these questions. The Greens are not prepared to talk about these issues. Rather, in secrecy, they want to rush the nominations through Senator Richardson to the World Heritage Committee. The whole issue has been shrouded in a cloud of secrecy and haste. More time must be granted in order that all areas can be properly assessed and the individuals involved can be correctly contacted and, if necessary, compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the necessity of there being an assessment of the economic potential of the area. I was concerned about the impact of this accord some time ago. In fact I raised it by way of question on notice with Senator Cook because of implications of mining for the future of our State. I was very grateful for the senator's response, which I will quote. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not appropriate for me to speculate on what effect, if any the accord will have on the mining industry. With the exception of a number of specific areas identified in the accord such as Denison's spires, Hart's Mountains National Park, Little Fisher Valley, and the boundaries of any additional areas for gazettal as national park or nomination for World Heritage list are not defined and are matters which have yet to be considered by the Tasmanian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, that Government still has not considered them, and yet they are to be pushed in haste without parliamentary approval, through Senator Richardson, and they involve areas which include large areas of productive rural land. The good senator then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly true that as the currently producing mines are depleted the mining industry will increasingly depend on new mineral discoveries to remain viable. It is evident from discussions I have had with the Premier, Mr Field, that he is well aware of this and I would have expected in addressing this issue the Tasmanian Government will strike an appropriate balance between conservation of Tasmania's unique natural heritage and the definition and development of its undoubted mineral resource potential. </PARA>
<PARA>So here we have a potential listing going ahead without an identification of the development of an undoubted resource potential. I ask you, Minister, what role you are now playing in relation to ensuring that there is some assessment of the mineral potential, that there is some assessment of the agricultural land which could well be covered by this World Heritage Commission. What rights can Tasmanian landowners rely on in the future if this World Heritage listing goes ahead involving substantial areas, particularly in the Mole Creek area?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope not to take too much of the Senate's time tonight but, because of events, the main subjects today seem to have been the downgrading of the Australian credit rating and the disastrous pilots dispute. But a matter that has not received very much exposure today, although I am sure it will in the near future, and which is something of very great concern to me and, I think, to all Australians, is the latest episode in the continuing and concerted all-out attack on Australia's pharmacists by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that the stated aim of the Government was to reduce the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by something like $300m, but what has happened over the last year or so has been nothing short of all-out war against the pharmacists. We all know that the pharmacists are our primary health care providers, and that but for them the Medicare system would be much more expensive to run, because the pharmacists provide that primary health care that turns a lot of people away from doctors. People can get the sort of assistance they want from pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 18 months, the history trail of what has been happening to pharmacists is well worth noting. We would all remember the Government's efforts to transfer their payments system onto a computer based system, and as a result of that, the delays that occurred in payments. That in itself had quite a significant financial effect on pharmacists. On top of that we saw the removal from the scheme of widely used drugs and their replacement by generic brands, which not only caused the pharmacists to lose money or to have reduced profit margins, but also caused a lot of inconvenience to the public. Then on top of that we had the doubling of the maximum quantity of many prescribed items, which also had the effect of reducing pharmacists' incomes. It has been a totally frustrating exercise for the pharmacists. We have seen the public itself being inconvenienced, particularly pensioners and old people who have had drugs changed at the whim of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). We have had drugs coming off the list and going back on the list, and I do not know where it will all end. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that since January 1988 the Federal Government has slashed pharmacy income from pharmaceutical benefits scheme dispensing by some 12 per cent in real terms. There can be no argument about that. Over the past five years the cost of pharmacy goods has increased by 101.5 per cent and the labour costs have increased by 87 per cent. The pharmacists also contend that Government meddling, which has reduced their wholesale margins, has resulted in the surcharge of 5.2 per cent on all pharmaceutical benefits sold to community pharmacists. As I said earlier, the doubling of maximum quantities of many of the commonly prescribed items is another piece of interference introduced outside the pharmaceutical benefits pricing tribunal which itself reduced pharmacists' profits by quite considerable amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmacists themselves have attempted to increase their productivity and in fact they have achieved productivity gains of something like 5 per cent for the last 20 years. This industry, or a group of professional people, has achieved productivity gains. All they have received from the Government for their efforts is continual harassment and attempts to reduce their profit margins. At the pharmacists' own initiative they put in place this computer system, replacing the old failed Pharmpay system developed by the Department. In fact, the Department actually received a productivity award for adopting this initiative, which in itself was quite incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest development, if it goes ahead-when you take note of some of the inflammatory statements made by Mr Staples today I can understand why the pharmacists are so distressed-is that over 1,000 pharmacies could shut down. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All around Australia, and the proposal is to slash dispensing fees by something like 23 per cent. That cuts $1.05 from every prescription fee and abolishes the 25 per cent mark-up on the wholesale price of drugs. I am sure a lot of Government backbenchers are concerned about this. I have heard comments from Tony Lamb and another former pharmacist, Jim Snow. They have hopefully tried to convince the Government that the provocative actions it is taking should not go ahead, because the pharmacists, unlike the airline pilots, have for the moment anyway, ruled out a national strike. If ever anyone had a reason to strike, the pharmacists have because of the continual harassment, loss of profit and reduction in profit margins that this Government is forcing upon them. The likelihood is that 1,000 pharmacies will be forced into closure with a consequent loss of jobs particularly among females. To be told by Mr Staples that the Pharmacy Guild must bear much of the blame for the pharmacists' plight really is the sort of statement you would expect to hear from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could quote some of the figures from my own small State of Tasmania which would show the effect in quite a few country pharmacies there. There are 153 community pharmacies in Tasmania and if this recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal goes ahead, one in three-or approximately 50 of those pharmacies-will be forced to close. That will mean the loss of 250 jobs for females alone working in the pharmacies. At the moment an average Tasmanian pharmacy would write about 100 scripts per day. The loss of $1 per prescription will mean a loss of $500 a week or $25,000 a year for the average pharmacist. I do not believe any businessman or worker would accept that cut in salary when everybody else is looking for increases. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note that the Government submitted to the Tribunal that a pharmacist's notional salary should be $15 an hour. This is less than half the equivalent hourly rate for the middle range government salaried pharmacist. The Government also claimed that pharmacies dispensing less than 30,000 prescriptions per year are inefficient. If one looks at that more closely, one will find that a pharmacy dispensing 30,000 scripts a year, open for 50 hours a week, would dispense something like 11 scripts an hour, or one every five minutes. What more does the Government want? For a great number of our Tasmanian pharmacies the 12 per cent reduction has already meant a loss in income of something like $40,000. Surely, on top of this, it is unreasonable to expect them to absorb another $25,000 cut in profits. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing about all this is that at our local university in Tasmania we have 75 students who are currently studying for their Bachelor of Pharmacy degrees. It is critical that, over the next 12 months, they receive work experience, because that is part of their course. They have to have that practical experience before they can obtain their degrees. If these pharmacies are forced to close it will make it a lot more difficult for those students to get practical experience. If they are to gain that, they may be forced to head for the mainland, like a lot of our unfortunate young people are being forced to do by government action. The closure of these pharmacies will just about deny them any chance they will ever have of qualifying to be pharmacists in their own State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's case, the pharmacists state, is based on a database study that is completely unacceptable to them and has been shown to have significant statistical and methodological flaws. For instance, the figures that were used in this database study are out of date; the survey results represent less than one per cent of the pharmacies in Australia; and the key costings, such as wages, were based on unrealistic figures. We will hear a lot more about this over the next week or so. </PARA>

They have every reason to. For instance, the secretary of the Retail Pharmacy Employees Association has said that the Tribunal has been aided and abetted by the Federal Government. The Victorian branch, for instance, has stated that it is likely to lose up to 2,000 jobs in the State of Victoria and 400 pharmacies will be forced to close. That is something which the Government will certainly be taking notice of over the next week or two.</PARA></TALK.START>

In times to come people will read this Hansard and form the opinion-and I cannot see why they should not form the opinion-that certain members of my family had child migrant slave labour on the property. So I ask Senator Jenkins, if she has any decency and for the sake of the deceased members of my family, to withdraw the imputations that she has made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, certainly the lack of what she has said. She did not have the courage to withdraw the imputations about this other senator from Western Australia who had child migrant slave labour on his place and then went on to further back up the argument that she has taken on in the last few weeks. Senator Jenkins is quite entitled to put whatever arguments she has on behalf of child migrants, but by the same token I have all the rights on earth to put up any opposing views.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; I certainly have not been told who has threatened the million dollar writ. I do not know where Senator Jenkins got that from but I would like to know who threatened that. As Senator Knowles pointed out, I certainly did make certain arrangements in case this accusation was made outside of Parliament. But I do not have a habit of putting figures on any of those sort of things; I just leave it to my legal advisers and have them advise me. I would still like Senator Jenkins to answer that one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would certainly like to try to balance up some of the arguments that have been put here. I have a letter here that the sender requested me to read into the Hansard. I had decided this afternoon not to do that, in deference to the discussion I had with the Secretary of the Catholic Migration Centre of Western Australia but, Mr President, if you will allow me a few minutes I will read it into the Hansard. It is written by a fellow I do not always agree with, whose name is Brian G. Tennant, a social and law reform campaigner of Western Australia. I do not agree with everything he says, but I will just read out what he had to say on 20 August 1989. The letter, headed `Allegations of mis-treatment and or child abuse must be put in perspective', states:</PARA>
<PARA> My objective is not to discredit any of your correspondents allegations of child abuse in many of the orphanages but to suggest some of the alleged abuses are open to interpretation, such as slave labour and child abuse, and to give a balanced view. </PARA>
<PARA> At the age of one I was declared a State ward and spent the next 15 years in three orphanages: St Joseph's Orphanage, Castledare Boy's Home and Clontarf Boys Town. </PARA>
<PARA> During my experiences at Clontarf Boy's Town I was required to work Saturdays, after school and during the holidays either in the stock yard or in the kitchen. It was hard work. Looking back my interpretation of such work was simply a contribution to ones up-keep. I was also given the strap (referred to as corporal punishment) mainly in school for not doing my homework and for obtaining low marks. I don't believe this helped my schooling at all-but in those days corporal punishment was the norm in orphanages, colleges and public schools. Educational authorities in recent years have realized that this practise was not helping and decided that such punishment be outlawed and quite rightfully so. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be understood, child abuse is not restricted to orphanages for example, recently a teacher in a public school was convicted of abusing some fifty children. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1988, over 250 former child migrants and their families from the Christian Brothers Agricultural School Tardun, gathered in Geraldton to celebrate fifty years that have apparently brought more migrant joy than misery. </PARA>
<PARA> At Castledare in February 1989 several hundred ex-pupils from Clontarf, Castledare, Bindoon and Tardun, gathered with their families to pay tribute to two former teachers in recognition of 50 years of `unpaid service' in the Order of the Christian Brothers for the underprivileged children. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel indebted to both the good sisters and the brothers for doing the best they could with such limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>Brian G. Tennant. J.P. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I read those comments into the Hansard to try to give a balanced view of what went on 40 or 50 years ago. I believe that if these things happened then they should have been brought out, just like the war crimes. I think it is slightly late to worry about what happened. If there is any way that the Government of Western Australia, the Catholic migration organisation or the Federal Government-I have written to Senator Bolkus requesting help on behalf of the child migrants of Western Australia-can help the poor unfortunates that did not make the best of their chances in Australia, then I am all for it and I am working in that way. But please let us have a balanced argument. Let us not have any more arguments after 40 or 50 years about what was supposed to have gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I intend to wind up my remarks and I certainly would like Senator Jenkins to consider what I asked her to do this evening. If she has any decency at all she will withdraw her comments in respect of the people she named-the senators other than me and also the ones that are not around today to defend themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, earlier this evening when I was performing chair duty a motion presented by my colleague Senator Foreman was declared to be a formal motion. It was therefore put without debate and passed on the voices without dissent. The motion was that the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure have leave to meet during the sittings of the Senate on Friday, 1 September 1989 for the purpose of hearing evidence in public session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, had I not been in the chair I would not have objected to the motion being regarded as formal but I would have voted against it. My negative vote would not have made any difference to the passage of the motion and would have been directed not against my colleague but against the concept of public hearings of committees being held while the Senate is sitting. I have a strong conviction that when the Senate is sitting senators should attend the Senate or be in close proximity to the chamber so that they may attend when required. They cannot do this if they are attending public hearings. I mention this matter only to make it clear why there has until now been no evidence of my opposition to the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there are certainly a lot of people on our side of the chamber who felt exactly the same way as Senator Colston. It was put to us though that it was necessary, that there was no alternative, that arrangements had been put in place and that the House of Representatives was not sitting. But, certainly, the honourable senator was not alone in feeling that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak just briefly, at the end of what has been a long adjournment debate, on a matter that was raised by Senator Harradine at the beginning of the debate, and that is the untimely passing of Donald Kevin Moore at the age only 52 years, which occurred on 18 August 1989. I shall not go over the matters that Senator Harradine has already placed on the record. I can say that Donald Moore was a man who came to my office frequently. He made certain that I, as with others, was well informed of the views that he had on education matters and other matters relating to refugee resettlement and the like. He was assiduous in pursuing the issues that the Publicly Accountable Classroom Teaching Foundation, known as PACT, believed in. He will be sadly missed by very many in this community and, of course, particularly by his wife and three children-Jessica, Ivan and Bernadine. I wish to associate myself with the comments made by Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
