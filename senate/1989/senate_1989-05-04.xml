<TITLE>Health Care for the Elderly</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> if open not-for-profit health funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to,</PARA>
<PARA> take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out that the community deplores the persistent refusal to ban pornography in X and NVE Videos, Films and Publications, and deplores the resulting escalation of crime and sexual crime in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> Because Parliament has a direct and heavy obligation to ensure the safety of women and child-victims, your petitioners therefore request the House:</PARA>
<PARA> to ban the importation, and availability of pornography in Videos, Films and Publications,</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 to convert the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) to a public company, called the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited. It will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit SMEC's commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsible Minister for the Corporation, my colleague, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Barry Jones, will retain strategic oversight of the new company in line with the Guidelines for the Reform of Government Business Enterprises (GBE). </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a major step in implementing the reform package for the Corporation announced on 17 August 1988 and is part of the Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of Government Business Enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a further step to those already taken by this Government in the last five years to make SMEC a commercially viable organisation able to stand on its own two feet and to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the international market place. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking this route, the Government explicitly recognised:</PARA>
<PARA>the Corporation's outstanding international reputation for engineering excellence, particularly in the Asia Pacific region;</PARA>
<PARA>SMEC was ranked 62nd in a 1988 world survey of international engineering consulting firms;</PARA>
<PARA>its contribution to the export of engineering services</PARA>
<PARA>both as a winner of export awards and in assisting the development of the Australian engineering consulting industry through joint ventures and in gaining an overseas track record. </PARA>
<PARA>SMEC's head office will remain based in Cooma and the new company will continue to contribute benefits to the Cooma region. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike many other GBEs, SMEC does not have large capital requirements. Its assets lie in human capital and its skills base, as a professional organisation marketing its skills in an international arena. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation was established under the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 to preserve the professional engineering expertise developed during the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Its functions now include investigating, advising on, designing, supervising, maintaining and operating engineering works both within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1970 SMEC has completed 1350 projects in 50 countries with a capital value of $4500 million and has earned consulting fees of $294 million. </PARA>
<PARA> It has received a capital contribution from the Commonwealth totalling $16.6 million while returning dividends to the Government totalling $3.3 million. In addition it has paid corporate taxes amounting to $11 million, as well as $7 million in State payroll and land taxes and $1.3 million in local government taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation recorded losses between 1983-84 and 1986-87, but returned to profitability last year as a much leaner totally restructured organisation. In 1987-88 SMEC recorded an operating profit before income tax of just over $270,000 as opposed to a budgeted loss of $1.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA>This was a remarkable achievement by the Board and the Corporation and marks the turnaround in the fortunes of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>The return to profitability is continuing through 1988-89 and it is anticipated that a substantial dividend will be forthcoming from the 1988-89 result. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to pay tribute here to the efforts of my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services, Stewart West, who as the former Minister for Housing and Construction had responsibility for the Corporation until the changes to the machinery of government in 1987. Acknowledgement is also due to the Board of SMEC under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Cook, for its major achievement in bringing SMEC back to profitability. SMEC has already made large strides in directions marked out by the Government's strategy for GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1983, the Government has made capital injections to fund redundancy packages and provide working capital; amended the SMEC Act to provide greater commercial freedom, and appointed a Board of Directors to give access to a greater range of management talent from the engineering, marketing, finance and trade union sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation has introduced revised management and budgeting systems, corporate and business development plans and marketing strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>A new superannuation scheme was introduced in March 1987 and consideration is at present being given to bringing this new scheme even more in line with schemes presently operating in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Other commercial actions taken by SMEC included the disposal of surplus staff housing and adjusting housing rentals closer to market norms, as well as the consolidation of SMEC's operations in Cooma on one site thus eliminating high rental costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The reform package is a further significant step and this Bill is a major element, bringing the process of reform even closer to completion. </PARA>
<PARA>Other important elements of the reform package are:</PARA>
<PARA>revised remuneration arrangements for the Managing Director with the amendment of the SMEC Act contained in the Government Business Enterprises (Miscellaneous Reforms) Act 1988;</PARA>
<PARA>revised industrial relations co-ordination arrangements; and,</PARA>
<PARA>new planning and accountability mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>When the nexus was broken with the Public Service Board in June 1986 SMEC came under the umbrella of the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, under the draft revised arrangements, increased responsibility and autonomy are to be devolved to SMEC but it will be expected to continue to comply with Government wages and industrial relations policies, and with guidelines (yet to be approved) which will specifically apply to:</PARA>
<PARA>wages and conditions of employment matters covered by the national wage case principles;</PARA>
<PARA>terms and conditions of employment with flow-on implications such as leave, allowances, hours of work and penalty payments;</PARA>
<PARA>redundancy and retrenchment conditions;</PARA>
<PARA>superannuation as an element of remuneration; and</PARA>
<PARA>procedures for handling significant industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>New planning and accountability mechanisms include the provision by SMEC of a three-year rolling Corporate Plan. This plan is to be updated annually and is a comprehensive document outlining the Corporation's goals and financial targets, and strategies and actions to achieve those goals. It also includes an assessment of the commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsible Minister will also maintain strategic oversight of share purchases in subsidiaries and associates, and the establishment of subsidiaries and joint ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial targets will be set and SMEC will report annually giving account of performance against goals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is at present a senior Departmental officer with observer status at the Board meetings and it is intended that this practice will continue. It is also intended that the current composition of the Board remain unchanged with the present Directors being the initial Directors of the new company pending the first general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> As with any public company SMEC will be subject to its Memorandum and Articles of Association and these will be prepared by the Attorney-General's Department. On behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, the responsible Minister will exercise control in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. In accordance with the proposed Memorandum and Articles of Association the responsible Minister shall have the power to appoint and dismiss the SMEC Board Directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Following conversion to a public company the responsible Minister may, if he wishes, issue policy guidelines to Directors as and when required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill by making SMEC subject to the Companies Act 1981 has the twofold effect of making SMEC a public company and enabling the removal of many of the statutory controls that have applied in the past and which are inappropriate for a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement to operate in accordance with the Companies Code places on directors responsibilities to shareholders (in SMEC's case the Commonwealth) and other obligations which provide for the protection of the Commonwealth's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that SMEC start operations as a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory on 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, this Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>provides for the conversion of SMEC to a public company under the Companies Act;</PARA>
<PARA>maintains the corporate identity of SMEC so that all existing contracts, its taxation position and other assets and liabilities are unchanged upon conversion;</PARA>
<PARA>provides for all staff to continue employment on their present terms and conditions and preserves all their accrued entitlements;</PARA>
<PARA>removes the day to day bureaucratic controls over the commercial decision making processes of the corporation; and,</PARA>
<PARA>replaces these with the strictures of the requirements of the companies legislation, and places SMEC on the same footing in this regard as any other public company. </PARA>
<PARA>In conjunction with the Bill, mechanisms will be established for strategic oversight of the new company's activities by the Government and to ensure that the company operates within wages and industrial relations policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A major benefit of this legislation is that the company maintains the same corporate entity as the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuity of corporate entity dispenses with the need to transfer assets and liabilities from the Corporation to the new public company and means that all contracts, agreements, and arrangements entered into by or on behalf of the Corporation which are in force immediately before the transition to a public company will apply to the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> This route is the same as that taken by other GBEs such as Australian Airlines and ANL. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill removes controls such as the requirement for the Treasurer's approval for individual borrowing arrangements, and investment and banking arrangements. However, SMEC will remain subject to the Loan Council global borrowing limits and will be liable for the Commonwealth borrowing levy on any borrowings. It will however forego all forms of Government guarantee and will not be able to claim protection from the shield of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also removes the requirement for SMEC to obtain ministerial approval for non project related contracts, and the requirement to have its accounts audited by the Auditor-General. The SMEC Board must seek the responsible Minister's approval to the appointment of the proposed company's future auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of share capital will be fixed under the Bill at a maximum of $5,207,807 which represents the capital contributed by the Commonwealth as at 30 June 1988 less accumulated losses. The capital will be divided into $1 par shares, with all shares to be held, at least initially, by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also allows for shares to be issued at a premium which is to be determined by the responsible Minister. If a premium is determined, there will be a transfer from the share capital account to a share premium account to reflect that premium and the number of shares issued will be reduced accordingly. The purpose of this is to allow for the possible future introduction of a staff equity participation scheme. The share premium account would be necessary to enable the repurchase of shares from the staff as they leave the employment of SMEC. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of such a scheme is yet to be fully considered by this Government and will not be introduced without prior consultation and agreement of SMEC's staff and unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the conversion of SMEC into a public company in four steps. The first step involves the creation of share capital, and the application by SMEC to the National Companies and Securities Commission to be registered as a company. </PARA>
<PARA> When SMEC issues shares, provisions of the current Act which relate to the current capital structure of SMEC will be repealed, by proclamation of the relevant repealing provision in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step is the transition of SMEC to a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> The final step is automatic and ensures that SMEC maintains its present corporate entity. That is, the section of the current Act dealing with the establishment of SMEC is, by force of the Bill, repealed immediately after SMEC becomes a registered company by proclamation of clause 12 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation position of the Corporation is to become the taxation position of the company in all respects including losses. </PARA>
<PARA> On transition to a public company each staff member of the Corporation will become an employee of the company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the Corporation. Accumulated entitlements such as long service and recreation leave, and sick leave will be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing provisions covering superannuation will be maintained on transition for staff who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. All new staff since the introduction of the SMEC scheme in 1987, are only eligible to join the SMEC scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Those staff who have mobility rights under Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 will retain those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains consequential amendments to other Acts to ensure that the new company remains subject to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987, and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The Schedule to the Sales Tax Assessment Act which identifies those Commonwealth bodies which are not exempt from sales tax will be amended to delete reference to the Corporation. SMEC was not previously exempt from sales tax and as a company it will continue to pay sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth, nor State and Territory taxes on the transfer of assets as part of the proposed re-organisation of SMEC in recognition of the fact that there will be no change in the Commonwealth's beneficial ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents a further step in the Government's program of micro-economic reform in the freeing up of Government Business Enterprises from the burden of detailed day to day bureaucratic controls, but maintaining strategic oversight controls. It is also a further step in the Government's efforts to ensure the full commercial viability of SMEC recognising its unique position as a government owned consulting engineering firm and its leading involvement as an Australian company in engineering consultancy projects in our region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night there was a little confusion, but I understand that the variation which the Australian Democrats made to their amendment was simple to substitute `the Government' for `Attorney-General's Department'. I was in the process of moving our amendment to that, which sought to substitute `the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs' for `the Government'. I hope the Government will not take that as disrespectful, but it happens to be my view that an investigation and report from a Senate committee might well be undertaken more expeditiously. I now regret, as the months have gone by, that clauses 9 and 10 were not referred to the same Senate committee at the end of last year. Had that been the case, the whole of the debate concerning the relationship between the Designs Act and the Copyright Act as they affect those provisions could have been considered in time and with all due effort. The advice of the Senate through its committee system would now be before us. At any rate, that did not happen. If I had a choice I would take that course today, but I know that the Government and the Democrats would not support such a move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third best option is that the Senate express an opinion today that the Committee, notwithstanding the passing of the legislation at the second reading stage, should address its mind to the design questions and report back to the Parliament. If our amendment to the Democrats' amendment is unsuccessful, I would nevertheless like to hear from the Government as to how it interprets the Democrats' amendment which proposes that the Senate express its opinion that the Government should examine and report. Is the Government prepared to indicate that it will accept the advice and prepare a report in accordance with the detail of Senator Macklin's amendment? How long does the Government think it might take to bring down that report? Is it willing to indicate that it will put a report to the Senate so that at least that report can be noted and debated in this chamber and perhaps, if necessary, referred to the appropriate Senate committee for further consideration? But I urge upon the Democrats and the Government that a better choice in this amendment of the Australian Democrats would be to express the opinion that the Senate Committee look at the question rather than simply relying on the Government to do so. </PARA>

Any Independents who have acquainted themselves with it, I am sure, also support it. There is only one technical amendment to be moved. The purpose of the straightforward technical amendment to clause 11 of the Circuits Layout Bill is to clarify the meaning of originality in the Bill. A number of representations the Government has received on the Bill have made the point that paragraph 11(c) does not express the Government's intentions set out in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill protect only the particular form or layout of a chip and not its function. The Government considers this intention is clear from the rest of the Bill, in particular, clauses 5 and 17 and paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 11. The words of paragraph 11 (c) have caused an unintended confusion and do not enhance the Bill's purpose; thus it is proposed that the paragraph be deleted by virtue of the amendment.

<PARA> (1) Page 1, after subclause 2 (1), insert the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1a) Section 10 commences on the day on which a provision amending the Designs Act 1906 commences, being a provision that enables the registration, under that Act, of a corresponding design that in the absence of such a provision, is not registrable under that Act for any reason other than that it is not new or original.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 1, after clause 3, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Interpretation</PARA>
<PARA> ``3a. For the purposes of subsection 2 (1a), `corresponding design' has the same meaning as in section 74 of the Principal Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 4, clause 10, proposed paragraph 77 (1) (a), line 29, leave out ``made before the commencement of this section or otherwise'', insert ``made at any time on or after the commencement of this section''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments relate to the interaction between the Copyright Act and the Designs Act. One thing I learnt quickly in this place was to count. I realise that these amendments will be unsuccessful because of the agreement that has been reached between the Government and the Australian Democrats. They have, in effect, implemented the first step of that agreement by having carried this morning Senator Macklin's second reading amendment. Nevertheless, I think it is important that I say a few words to outline the reasons why I have moved these amendments and why it would still be our view that they should be carried by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We appreciate the concerns of artists and craftspeople as to the deficiencies in the existing law. During the development of these amendments and the debate in the other place, and between the other place and the Senate, there has been a great deal of material supplied to interested senators, and I suspect to other senators, detailing the reasons why, as I said, artists and craftspeople have called for the amendments that are contained within the Government's Bill. There is no doubt that they have suffered as a result of the existing legislation in terms of the ease with which they can lose control of their property which can be used for industrial purposes. I believe that this is explained as well as anywhere in the Australian Copyright Council's bulletin No. 61 on copyright and design law reform issues. This publication looks particularly at the concerns that the artists and craftspeople have had with the section 77 of the Act. The publication states:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 77 provides that where work used as a design is industrially applied to articles which are sold, let for hire or offered or exposed for hire, then the artistic work loses copyright protection in relation to use on the type of article to which it has been applied. After 16 years copyright is lost in relation to the use of the registrable design on all articles. Under regulation 17 of the copyright regulations, the design is deemed to be applied industrially if it is applied either on more than 50 articles or to one or more articles manufactured in lengths or pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the effect of section 77 is that if an artistic work is used as a design on more than 50 articles or on one which is manufactured in lengths or pieces, then design registration will be essential. Once an industrial application of this type has occurred the copyright owner can no longer rely on copyright to prevent unauthorised use of the work on those articles. </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, therefore, the artists and craftspeople have wanted to bring protection of their property clearly back within the provisions of the copyright legislation rather than the designs legislation. The deficiencies, from their point of view, of the design protection regime are also detailed in bulletin No. 61. We understand that and we have noted the large volume of recent submissions from a range of artistic and craft bodies throughout the country urging the Senate to pass clauses 9 and 10 as urgently as possible and without variation. Nevertheless, as is often the case in this business, there is another side to the story. In this instance, the other side concerns industrial designs which, it seems to us, will lose protection as a result of the passing of clauses 9 and 10 in an unamended form. We understand that many designs cannot be registered under the Designs Act and although there are technical reasons why this is so, the fact that they cannot be registered has considerable consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reasons why the designs cannot be registered. If a design has features of shape or configuration, by definition it is a design and cannot be registered under the Designs Act. If a design is such that its features cannot be judged by the eye, likewise it cannot be registered. If a design constitutes a method or principle of construction, such a design cannot be registered. This causes us concern and, obviously, also causes considerable concern to those who are in the business of industrially utilising designs and wanting to maintain that protection. It has therefore been suggested that this question of the loss of protection through the interaction of these two Acts in the light of the two new clauses being advocated by the Government should be referred to a Senate committee for detailed consideration, not in any way in an attempt to avoid the extra protection that seems justified to artists and craftspeople, but to avoid what seems to us and to others, including the Law Council, the unintentional consequences. Clearly, the matter has not been referred to a Senate committee and that is regrettable. We came up with a solution which we believed would, in effect, still save the day in relation to those designs. That is basically what is included in the substance of our first three amendments. Our first amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 1, after subclause 2 (1), insert the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1A) Section 10 commences on the day on which a provision amending the Designs Act 1906 commences, being a provision that enables the registration, under that Act, of a corresponding design that in the absence of such a provision, is not registrable under that Act for any reason other than that it is not new or original.''. </PARA>
<PARA>We are asking for a delay in the commencement of section 10 until alterations can be made to the Designs Act to provide the protection which we believe is lost implementing these two provisions in their current form. The Minister's second reading speech last night made it clear that the Government will not accept that amendment and the Australian Democrats have indicated that they will not accept it. The deal done between the Australian Democrats and the Government on this issue is rather to pass the second reading amendment, which we did this morning, and refer this designs question back to the Government for further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> It is needless for me to say that the Government in any event should be considering this matter but at least we now have the statement of the Minister this morning that it will do so and that it will report to the Senate, so that the substance of our concerns can be looked at in detail and, if necessary, as I said a little while ago, be again referred to a committee. We regard the matter as urgent and we hope that the Government will treat it likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> Other alternatives were open, in our opinion, to achieve the objectives. One was that clause 9 could have been amended to give the protection that was necessary to artists and craftspeople, with only clause 10 referred to a committee for detailed consideration. That was something that I explored with the Australian Democrats' advisers, but they were not of a mind to go down that path. </PARA>
<PARA> I am trying to indicate that we were not rigid in believing that the proposition that we put in these amendments is the only way to address this matter. While we believed and still believe that it is the best way, when it became apparent that it would be unsuccessful in this chamber we explored all other possibilities. Unfortunately, it seems to us that the best of those possibilities has been unacceptable to the Government and to the Australian Democrats and that we have no alternative but to rely upon the Government's report, which we can now look forward to under the second reading amendment that has been passed today. It was important for me to move the amendments at least to emphasise our concern in relation to this matter, even though I am prepared to acknowledge that it is somewhat of a fruitless task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the amendments moved by the Opposition with regard to this item. As Senator Hill has just said, there has been a great deal of discussion on these matters, and the propositions put by the Opposition had, for us at least, an initial attraction. A problem undoubtedly exists in this area. The difficulty in dealing with this legislation is that there does not seem at the moment to be an effective way out without some sort of massive restructuring exercise. Indeed, there is probably not a way out within the context of the legislation. That is why the Senate has sought from the Government, on my motion, a more detailed look at the relationships between items which may be of a craft nature but which may then become a matter of industrial design.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government amendments to the original legislation undoubtedly have a great deal of support in the community. I should like to mention some of them briefly. For example, the Institute of Modern Art has said in its letter to the Australian Democrats:</PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 9 and 10 . . . are important for the continued growth of Australia's artistic and cultural life, and will redress an inequity widely criticised . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Writers Guild said that these are truly important reforms which it sees as justified and indeed even conservative. Other supporting groups include the National Association for the Visual Arts; the Aboriginal Artists Agency Ltd; Craft Australia, which, of course, represents a very large number of bodies and has constituent craft councils in every State; and Actors Equity of Australia. One from which I should like to read is from Tiwi Aboriginal Designs, which acts as the agent for the Tiwi people. It has written:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 10 years the Tiwi Aborigines, who own and operate their own incorporated Screen Print workshop, have had their fabric designs stolen on six occasions to my memory. </PARA>
<PARA> On each occasion the law was inadequate to protect them and my company has had to resort to threats of exposure in the press unless a royalty settlement was agreed to. Unfortunately redress outside of the law has been difficult to recover. Their designs have been copied and then imported into Australia from Bali and the USA as well as copied by several Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA>When one considers the commercial worth of many of those designs now, it is extraordinary that that type of product has not been previously protected by law. It seems to us that it is now impossible to go back on the Government's move which has sought to fix up this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Faculty of Law, for example, at Sydney University, through its lecturer on law, Shelley Wright, on industrial and commercial property, says:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the failure to pass these amendments, sacrificing the broader issues of fairness to authors and artists to a small sector of industry who would like to maintain a questionable monopoly the Copyright Act was not designed to give them, would be an abdication of the responsibility of Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that I necessarily go along with the notion of a questionable monopoly with regard to industrial design. In fact, what we have here, as correctly set out by Senator Hill, is a clash of claims. That is nothing new to those of us who have been working with this legislation. It is an area in which principles clash on a fairly regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the proposition has been put by many other people but probably most clearly by the Australian Copyright Council in a letter to us as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In my letter of 20 March 1989, together with a background paper and other supporting materials, the Council urged that clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill be passed unamended as soon as possible. We did, however, indicate that we would not object to one of the options put by Warman International Ltd. This was that an amended clause 9 be passed alone. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed this compromise position with officers of the Attorney-General's Department and now agree with those officers that this option is not technically possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It was our view at the time that there could possibly be an amended clause 9 that might deal with the issue. We realised, on further reflection, as did the Copyright Council, that this really is not possible. The letter from the Council goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly the Council withdraws the qualified support it had given to this option and urges that clause 9 and 10 both be passed in an unamended form as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot go through the rest of the large number of representations on this issue that have been made around the country. The upshot of the exercise is that although this is not the optimum position which one would like to have achieved, I believe the best course that is open to this chamber at this time is to pass clauses 9 and 10, as moved by the Government, and hope that the Government will look clearly and rapidly at the types of protection that we need in other areas. One of the problems for people working in the industrial design area is that these clauses may not be so attractive. The claws on a dredge are nowhere near as attractive to most people as the Tiwi design, and they may very well have lost out. On the other hand, one should be very clear that what we are talking about in the industrial design area is of significant economic worth to the community. We should not push aside the claims made by the people dealing in the industrial design area. Those claims need to be addressed, and need to be addressed rapidly. The fact that some of those designs could fall outside such protection without anybody knowing about it, and without the person who thought they possessed the design protection knowing that they no longer have it, is a situation which ought not to be allowed to continue, and we need protection in that area as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to raise-and I found it extraordinary when I came across it in some discussions I had on this Bill over the last couple of months-is that I was unaware that things such as ratios were able, under the previous operations, to be protected. I found that rather extraordinary. Indeed, I hope that in the general look that we have at this area some of the past practices with regard to copyrighting and protection will themselves be reviewed. It seems to me totally anomalous that one should seek any protection for ratios. The ultimate context, of course, would be that somebody would want immediately to rush out and seek a copyright for pir2 and, hence, tie up absolutely everything to do with anything that is a wheel. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in my possession a case involving the protection of a series of ratios. This case happens to affect a number of companies in my own State which deal with the construction of dredgers and the supply of dredgers overseas. They thought that they had a coverage on them, but discovered that somebody else had managed to protect the notion of ratios. I thought that the whole thing was absurd. I then had the opportunity of talking to the person who originally designed the equipment. He assured me that, indeed, the material I was reading was correct-that those ratios had been secured. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the area of design registration and protection is one that could do with a great deal of careful analysis, but I must admit that that probably needs to be done in two phases. There needs to be-and I take this to be the implication behind Senator Hill's amendments-immediate protection, because we will face some serious problems if we do not move to some type of protection under either the Designs Act or the Patents Act, or some amendment that we will need with regard to those pieces of legislation. I have not made a study of either of those Acts or the possibility that we will be able to seek some type of immediate protection, but I assume that the Government, in its response today, will be able to indicate that it is already undertaking something along these lines. It is not as though these Bills have landed on us out of the blue. This matter has been the subject of intensive discussions over the last few weeks. I hope that the Government is not waiting for the passage of this Bill before any action is taken. If it does, some of those companies could suffer severe detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in not accepting the amendments put forward by Senator Hill, I do not want it taken that we reject the intent behind them. It is just that we feel that the counterclaim is excessively strong. The damage that has been done up to now in terms of that whole area of crafts and artistic productions has been massive, and the Government has at least got that part right. That should be secured, and additional work needs to be done in the other area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government rejects the amendments moved by Senator Hill. There is almost nothing that I need add to the response of Senator Macklin which indicates very clearly that we are in something of a dilemma, something of a predicament. It may be that, in protecting artists and craftspeople in a way which has certainly earned their plaudits-and that is perhaps the principal objective of these provisions-there is a gap, some small area of difficulty in the relationship between the copyright and designs areas, which, nevertheless, is proving extremely difficult to bridge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The registration system under the Designs Act is regarded as one of the broadest in the world, I am told. I think it was implemented in 1981 under a previous government. It was recognised then as securing a great expansion of the range of designs capable of registration. If a product does not qualify for registration under that wide system of registration, it is arguable that it may not be appropriate at all. This is one of the matters which ought to be looked at. It will be looked at in terms of the second reading amendment which has been accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The type of protection which might be offered by the Copyright and Design Acts, or by some amalgam of the two, or by some new methodology, is of such importance that the committee that meets within the government structures ought to have before it not only the formal terms of reference but also a transcript of the full debate carried out in this chamber. The comments by Senator Hill and Senator Macklin will be most helpful in putting the context and flavour of what might otherwise be a fairly arid set of terms of reference. I believe that the concerns that have been expressed will be taken into account. That is certainly my intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of copyright protection for three-dimensional industrial articles, which is what we are really talking about, may mean that manufacturers will be free to manufacture an article if upon searching the appropriate industrial property register the article is not covered by, for example, patents or design protection. But in so far as the manufacturer will be free to manufacture an article without the risk that there may exist a design in which copyright subsists, then I believe that the manufacturing sector will be aided. At least this was the view, as I understand it, of the 1973 Franki Copyright Law Committee on Reprographic Reproduction, which reported on this copyright designs interaction problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe that the passage of these clauses ought to be delayed pending amendment of the Designs Act to enable registration of designs not presently registrable under that Act. But I undertake that the full Hansard transcript of the comments made by Senator Hill and Senator Macklin will be part, effectively, of the terms of reference of the committee to be set up within the Government to provide the report to the Senate which has been sought. </PARA>

<PARA>Fair dealing for purpose of research or study</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>

<PARA>I do not wish to speak at length on this amendment, which will create a new section 103e of the Act to provide for fair dealing where an audio-visual item is to be used for the purposes of research or study. As I understand the position at the moment, this would be a breach of copyright. In this instance we have adopted a submission from the vice-chancellors of this country who have advocated that audiovisual items should, as much as possible, be treated in the same way as the written word. It seems to us that this is a logical extension. It provides for fair dealing, not an open slather. These matters in principle were set down in the principal legislation when technology had not developed as far as it has today. In fact, one of the great challenges of copyright legislation is to reflect the pace of change in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone engaged in research or study would be well aware of the importance of audiovisual material. It is not surprising, therefore, that principals of colleges of advanced education and vice-chancellors of universities in this country have come to the Parliament seeking the updating of the copyright legislation to include this provision, which would allow such protection as to enable research and study to be conducted with the use of audiovisual material without the fear of infringing the existing copyright law. As I have indicated, we adopted their submission and we bring this amendment to the Parliament for its consideration. </PARA>

Audiovisual items are not treated differently from printed material. There is already a fair dealing provision for individuals for the purposes of research and study. I have some difficulty coming to grips with the notion that we need to make a special exemption, as I had originally thought that this was included in the legislation.

My understanding is that the ways in which most students and researchers would use audiovisual material have been covered in much the same way as has printed matter. Obviously Senator Hill, by way of his amendment, believes that there is still a significant area which is not covered by fair dealing. I am still somewhat at a loss as to which areas Senator Hill is referring and which he feels are not adequately covered. If he still feels that there are such areas, as his amendment appears to suggest, it may be that we need to deal with them. I am still trying to come to grips with understanding which particular area Senator Hill is now aiming at. I felt it related to most of the items, other than, for example, a total reproduction of a film, which I fail to see as being necessary for the purposes of research. Under the normal processes, one could view the copy of the film obtained by an educational establishment for study purposes.

The Act sets out the matters to be taken into account in determining whether the usage of that material is so limited. These matters are set out in proposed new section 103e (2), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That adopts the type of language used in section 40 (2) of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the answer is involved in the interpretation of the word `work'. As I understand it, there are limitations as to how that has been interpreted. It was the view of the Vice Chancellor's Committee that section 40 as a whole has not been interpreted sufficiently widely to allow usage in this form for audiovisual items. It might be helpful if the Minister were to say to us that this practice is more useful than it used to be, and that the court will be directed to take into account the learned advice of the Attorney-General in these matters that, in the view of the Government `work' should be interpreted sufficiently widely to include audiovisual items. It might also be changing the law; I am not sure about that. I look to the definition of `work' in the existing Act and I see that it means:</PARA>
<PARA> a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not advance my argument far at all. Therefore, I presume that one needs to go one step further and look to the precedents. The Minister no doubt is on top of those, having sitting alongside him a team of advisers.

A student could go into a university library or media resource centre, or whatever they are called these days, and view a film, listen to a broadcast or a tape recording, or play a record or whatever, and that would not infringe copyright. Obviously there is no copying being done. But once a copying is undertaken of this subject matter other than a work covered by section 40 (1), then it is felt that the creative person who contributed to that film, tape or record or whatever it might be, should receive some remuneration. I have already pointed to the proposed educational television copying licences as an example. There is also some potential for abuse which must be recognised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not at all sure now that I am as clear about this as I was when I started. I thought I had a reasonable handle on what the audio- visual exercise was. The Minister's explanation has now made it a murky area indeed. What we are talking about in the audio-visual area could encompass an enormous range. The Minister is now saying that some of those are works. In other words, certainly a single photograph is a sole artistic item and could be treated as such. It could very well be a work. But a longer item-for example, a broadcast-is not. There are a number of crossover areas. I want to be clear in my mind that these are not included. An example is microfiche. In other words, I presume that a microfiche of printed material is dealt with in the same way as the printed material. I believe it is; at least until this debate started I believed that that was the case. I presume that reproduction of printed material in an audio form is treated as the printed material. In other words, we have within our universities, colleges of advanced education and technical colleges the ability to provide for blind people and others printed material in an audio form.

I must admit that, if it does not, I would lean much more towards Senator Hill's position than I did when I started. It seems to me that there is an excellent argument which relates to students studying. Let us say that a student is required to make to a tutorial group a presentation with regard to the causes, say, of the Second World War and he finds in the audiovisual area some early German material on the rise of Hitler. The student may wish to take a copy of part of it to play back in the tutorial room. I think that is the type of example that Senator Hill was referring to. It seems to me to be a perfectly permissible exercise. It is not for the purposes of circumventing copyright. It will not do a detriment to anybody. It is, in fact, for the purposes quite specifically of research and study. The quality of the reproduction will probably be sufficient for the tutorial room but for no one else. In other words, I had assumed that the use of parts of a copy, in terms of the audiovisual material, would be dealt with in the same way as the use of part of an article or a small portion of a book.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that, where one has the technology available to allow students to copy videos that are of interest to them, even apart from their tutorial assignments, one has the situation where possible abuse could occur.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply remind the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that protections currently exist in subsection (2) of section 42 to avoid abuse of fair dealing in relation to works and that, similarly, we are including protection in subclause (2) of our proposed section 103e. I really do not think that the argument about abuse-the Minister used the example of someone taking a videotape of a favourite program home for entertainment-has any merit at all. It seems to me that what is occurring is a development of technology and that, when the Act was drawn and passed, work was then looked at as matters of a fixed form, if I may so describe them. Now, of course, if we are looking at educational research purposes, which is what we are talking about, there is now available material of a different nature. One such type of material is that which we describe here as audiovisual. This aspect certainly is of concern to the educational institutions in this country, otherwise they would not have brought it to our attention and the Government's attention. They are simply asking that the law be updated to reflect the new technology, not that it be extended in some way as to go beyond the scope of the fair dealing provisions that exist in relation to works. I guess another way of doing it would be to expand the definition of works. The Opposition has done it slightly differently by specifically seeking to insert a parallel clause which deals with audio-visual items. This is simply another technique of achieving the same objective. Surely it ought to be carried unless there is something that fundamentally distinguishes an audiovisual item from one of these other forms of more traditional fixed work. I must say that I have a great deal of trouble personally distinguishing-if I might respectfully use Senator Macklin's example-between a slide and a small piece of a video tape. It seems to me to be very much of the same nature.

<PARA>It is suggested by my advisers that in relation to the sort of situation which Senator Hill had in mind where matters are brought in to a tutorial group and thrown up on the screen for the purposes of criticism and discussion of that particular item, then that might indeed provide a dealing which did not infringe copyright. As I say, the main argument is that with the type of material we are dealing with-the audiovisual material and the copying of whole works which otherwise should be remunerated in order to benefit the producers, the authors, the creators of those particular works the potential for abuse is such that we do not believe that Senator Hill's amendment ought to be carried because it goes against the whole aim to ensure that those who produce these works receive a fair remuneration for their effort and endeavour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that it was a good effort. However, it does seem to me an extraordinarily long bow to suggest that we are dealing with the item of criticism or review. I know that lawyers are very creative, but it seems to me that if one were selecting a piece of material for criticism or review it would be with regard to that material. Senator Hill has been talking about making use of audiovisual material for purposes of study and research which may not have anything to do with the intrinsic merits of the particular material that one is using, but one is using it to amplify, illustrate, spell out or clarify some other matter. I think it is extraordinary that in the Act a reviewer has the ability to escape any problems if he happens to say that this is a nasty bit of work. If he says that a restaurant is cooking in a particular way and he ends up with a defamation, that is his problem. If a person says that this particular film is a pretty trashy piece of work, then people will be able to copy it and look at it at leisure. But if a person wishes to use part of that work for the purposes of illustrating, for example, the manners of a particular period, then that is not fair dealing. I accept the proposition of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) of the protection of copyright. It might very well end up on a restriction of knowledge rather than anything else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that Senator Hill is perfectly correct in suggesting that the world is moving on and that more material is likely to be found in forms other than on the printed page. On the basis of this discussion, when I first came into the Parliament, I thought that this matter was covered. I now find the point that I thought was adequately covered is certainly not adequately covered and I therefore express support for Senator Hill's amendment because I think that it does cover that area. I do not think that the Minister should be too concerned because Senator Hill has made it very difficult with his proposed new section 103e (2). One has to hurdle items such as the purpose and character of the dealing; the nature of the audiovisual item; and the possibility of obtaining the audiovisual item within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price which means that it would rule out most of the items the Minister has referred to. In other words, his favourite program is down at the local video store at a reasonable price-generally $1 or a couple of dollars to hire. We are probably only looking at those items which are not commercially available, which are held only in collections and which are quite specifically held for the purposes of research and study. On that basis I indicate that the amendment that Senator Hill has put together, in the light of the Minister's answer, is a very reasonable and a very moderate one. I would have thought that the Government could very well wear that without too much problem at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst there is a certain amount of sense in what is being put by the Opposition, and supported by Senator Macklin, I think that one has to try to put oneself in the place of the producer of a videotape which has perhaps some educational merit or even is produced specifically for use by students or by those involved in making use of libraries in tertiary institutions or even in the general library system for their own edification rather than for a particular course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable senator is talking about that. He said that if it is copied by students in the library on one of these machines, then they need not pay any remuneration to the copyright owner. In that situation we could be depriving a producer of such a work of the incentive actually to produce it because the simple single sale to the University of Tasmania, for example, might not produce sufficient remuneration to justify the expenditure involved in putting together such a video. If it is used by a number of students who copy it, then I do not see why they should not make some contribution to enable the producer to get back and to make a profit on the considerable work that has gone into putting together that educational videotape. It is really that sort of situation that I think we ought to be keeping in mind if we are trying to create an industry-this has been, quite rightly, pointed out by Senator Hill-which embraces a new technological method to make this sort of material available in a way which is absorbed more readily because of its more interesting presentation by students. Really I think that is the final comment I would make in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The Opposition's amendments Nos 5 to 12 all deal with the one subject matter, that which I just mentioned to the Minister, the extension of the provisions that are included in the Bill relating to copying of television material to cover other mediums of communication such as audiovisual material. I again indicate that the amendments have resulted substantially from representations of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee and the Australian Committee of Directors and Principals in Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> Technology has moved on and the Government, a little more slowly than some, at least in the amendments which it put before the Committee today, caught up with the value of television in this area. So it has in its amending legislation new part Va, which deals with the copying of television broadcasts by educational and other institutions. The Vice-Chancellors' Committee is particularly interested in the educational aspect of this matter. It suggests to us and to the Government that, whilst extension into the area of television is to be applauded, we should seize the opportunity to encompass other areas of audiovisual communication. We have adopted that proposal and put it before the Committee today. Whether it concerns for example, the copying of original radio material or existing audiovisual material, there seems to be an argument that within educational institutions it is worth while. </PARA>
<PARA>As we all know, we have already overcome the debate that there should be proper remuneration to those who have property in the original material. Why not provide a remuneration regime similar to that which is proposed by the Government in relation to television for these further extensions of communicative vehicles? By means of these amendments, we put that before the Committee. We define audiovisual items to include sound recordings, cinematograph films, television and broadcasts. Most of the amendments that follow are of a supplementary nature. However, we recognise that by bringing in other types of material we may well create a need to divide the collecting societies. In other words, it may not be possible to get a single collecting society for interested owners; it may be necessary to divide the society into a number of collecting societies. We do not seek to set that form in concrete. My colleague Senator Puplick might wish to make some comments on that also. We seek to provide some flexibility in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly press upon the Committee the wisdom of updating these provisions to include other methods of communication, particularly radio broadcasts. We cannot see any logical reason why the copying of published audiovisual material should not be included, as has been sought by the vice-chancellors and the directors and principals of advanced education bodies, provided that fair remuneration is included within the scheme for the owners of the intellectual property. That is the rationale of the amendments that we put to the Committee. We submit that they are logical extensions, that they have merit in the same way the previous amendment-which, I am pleased to say, the Committee adopted-had merit. I therefore commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will know, the scheme put forward in the Bill for the consideration of the Senate relates to television broadcasting only and not to radio because it was impressed upon us that this was the area of greatest need and an area in which new technology can clearly be used in schools for teaching purposes. We ought to catch up with that clear fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as radio broadcasts are concerned, section 200 (2) of the Copyright Act already provides a workable exemption, enabling educational institutions to copy broadcasts intended for educational purposes. In addition, new section 200 (2a) will provide that it is not an infringement of copyright in a radio broadcast to make a copy of the broadcast for educational purposes. Educational institutions have impressed upon us the need for a wider scheme to allow for radio broadcasts perhaps to be subject to a statutory licensing scheme. Their main interest is in the schools broadcast-type material and that, as I say, is sufficiently covered and permitted to be copied under section 200 (2). </PARA>
<PARA> We have already covered some of the ground with respect to audiovisual items. It may be thought that now there is a provision for fair dealing with audiovisual items for research or study, the sort of scheme that is now being put forward is not required. If the other place agrees to our amendments, we will have permitted that audiovisual material which is used for study purposes-within the various qualifications and in the ways suggested by Senator Hill's amendment, which has been accepted by the Committee-to be exempted from the provisions of the Copyright Act concerning the need for remuneration. In that situation, to go any further and put in the sort of scheme that Senator Hill has in mind is unnecessary. It is the claim of Senator Hill that his amendment for fair dealing will not discourage copyright owners from producing educational audiovisual material. I hope that is the case, but I think we should rest with the amendment we have passed, if it is accepted in the other place, rather than go on to put together the major and elaborate scheme which Senator Hill proposes here. </PARA>
<PARA> Some drafting matters also appear somewhat unusual, for instance, the end effect of the definitions offered by Senator Hill. The honourable senator said that a television broadcast includes an audiovisual item and an audiovisual item includes a sound recording. So it ends up with a television broadcast including a sound recording. I do not know that that is necessarily unusual in the annals of the drafting of legislation. It is one of the oddities that ought to be pointed out to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> My real point is that radio broadcasts, such as the school broadcasts which are a very important part of the work of educational institutions, are sufficiently covered. I believe that fair dealing with audiovisual materials has already been provided for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief comment on one of the aspects of the Opposition amendments which are before the chamber at the moment. Opposition amendment 12 deals with collecting societies per se and proposes to leave out proposed section 135p in the Government's legislation and substitute a new proposed section 135p. The rationale for this has been covered in a large part by the comments that Senator Hill has already made on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention to one particular aspect of our proposed new section 135p, subsection (4) of which provides in effect for the establishment of more than one collecting society for this purpose. It will be seen that, in the Government's Bill, proposed new section 135p (2) provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General shall not name more than one body in a declaration and shall not make a declaration while an earlier declaration is in force. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, only one collecting society can be declared at any particular time. Proposed section 135p (4) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) Where the Attorney-General has declared a body to be the collecting society for a specified class of copyright owners, the Attorney-General may refuse to declare another body to be the collecting society for that class of copyright owners unless satisfied that to do so would be in the interests of those copyright owners, having regard to the number of members of the first-mentioned society, the scope of its activities and such other considerations as are relevant.''. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it provides that it is at the discretion of the Attorney-General to declare that there may be more than one collecting society for the purposes of this part. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish simply to make the comment that collecting societies exist in a number of areas which are provided for within copyright law. They exist in relation to the photocopying of material, the broadcasting of music and various other aspects. There is only one collecting society in each of these areas and those persons who are copyright owners are really put on a take it or leave it basis in respect of the operations and activities of those collecting societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Some societies have operated very well. I have no complaint, for example, about the way in which this has tended to operate in relation to music broadcasts and rebroadcasts. But, on a number of occasions, the owners of copyright have complained to me that the activity of their collecting society is unsatisfactory, that, as clients, they are dealt with in an unsatisfactory fashion and that they have absolutely no redress because the Government has created, as it were, a statutory monopoly for undertaking these activities and only one society operates in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's proposed new section 135p (2), there would in fact be a single collecting society. The Government endorses the monopoly position and those people who are not satisfied with the way in which that operates would not have any redress and the Attorney-General would in effect have to abolish one collecting society and establish a new single collecting society if the society simply did not perform its functions properly. Our amendments suggest that there could be the situation in which it would be advantageous to the owners of copyright to have more than one collecting society which might in fact do slightly different things and be responsible for slightly different aspects of the very broad scope of activities that this new section in the legislation is to cover. </PARA>
<PARA> I would value the Minister's explanation on one matter. I am interested to know the extent to which the Parliament-not the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General or some other officer-is kept informed of the work and activities of these collecting societies. I do not want improperly to anticipate a matter in debate, but it will be seen that, in relation to the proposed reports that are to be forwarded to the Attorney-General dealing with the administration of the blank tape levy, which comes under Part Vc of the legislation, the Opposition's proposed amendment 17 requires that the report that is to go to the Attorney-General be forwarded by the Attorney-General to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There are too many instances creeping into legislation in which reports by bodies whose existence is dependent upon the will of the Parliament are sent to Attorneys-General, to officers or to Ministers, but are not then forwarded to the Parliament so as to allow the Parliament to undertake some scrutiny or some observation of the activities of the organisation for whose creation the Parliament has been responsible. I should value the advice of the Minister for Justice on the extent to which the Parliament is kept informed of the operations of the collecting societies. It seems to me that some of them end up lodging reports with State corporate affairs commissions or similar bodies rather than lodging them with the requisite Federal Minister or department. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, it is very difficult to get hold of copies of annual reports of collecting societies to see how they have administered their operations, discharged their statutory responsibilities and how much money they have spent on their administration as distinct from forwarding it to the owners of the copyright on whose behalf they are supposed to be acting. That is a very unsatisfactory way of going about things. There needs to be a far greater degree of reporting back to the Parliament about the operations of these bodies. In this instance, particularly given the extended scope which Senator Hill, on behalf of the Opposition, has proposed for the operation of this whole area, there ought also to be the possibility, in a legislative form, of the Attorney-General designating more than one organisation to be a collecting society for the purposes of this part, because he has to be satisfied, in the terms of our amendment, that it would be in the interests of the copyright owners for that to be undertaken, having regard to the requirements that are set out in the Opposition's amendments to which I have been making reference. </PARA>

I was referring there to our proposed amendment No. 17, which relates to the requirement in the Government's legislation to the forwarding to the Attorney-General of a report on the operation of the blank tape levy. Our amendment would require the Attorney-General to then forward it to the Parliament. We are simply establishing the principle quite clearly that Parliament ought to be directly provided with the information. The matter I was raising with the Minister was the mechanism by which the Government believes that the Parliament can scrutinise the activities of the collecting societies. Why is it that reports of collecting societies which have been established by parliamentary enactment are not immediately available to Parliament, even in the sense of being tabled as, for example, the reports of administering authorities under bounty legislation are tabled? For example, the annual report of the Bounty (Books) Act, which shows the distribution of money under that Act, at least keeps Parliament informed. I think there are also provisions under the Public Lending Right Act for that sort of information to be readily available to Parliament. It does not appear, however, that Parliament has equal access to material which arises as a result of the operations of collecting societies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -We are dealing with a variety of amendments together. The one concerning television broadcasts is interesting. By and large, the Government's reference to a television broadcast covers all things broadcast on television, including, for example, a cinegraphic film. Senator Hill proposes that we expand that, by means of his amendment, to include other areas and any work, including a cinegraphic film. There are difficulties here because there are two quite distinct areas. The principle of being able to copy from a television broadcast is quite different from the principle of being able to copy a film.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A television broadcast is one which, at some time, has gone to potentially every member of the public. In other words, by whatever commercial mechanisms now available it is possible to broadcast a particular film to literally everybody, so that everybody has a chance to see it. Hence, one can say that such a broadcast of a film has exhausted the market. Indeed, as I understand it, in terms of the commercial potential of new films, there has been a significant discussion within the commercial television context as to which part of the market is exhausted by showing a film on television. That consideration partly influences the way in which prices are set for a variety of films. That is quite different from any broadcast of any film on its own which never, theoretically or practically, exhausts the market. That fact is taken care of in a commercial context by the cost of the hire of a film for showing to a limited audience in a theatre or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) alluded to by way of reference to the radio, the use of many television broadcasts by educational institutions is by way of the easy method of copying directly from the broadcast. In fact, it is almost beyond the financial means of every school in Australia to hire most of the films which are currently released, except when they have film nights and show films which almost pre-date the beginning of cinema and whose prices are reduced to a level which schools can afford to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I am worried by Senator Hill's amendment, which seems to broaden the definition. I am not at all sure whether this is intended because he still seems to be intending that a television broadcast be an audiovisual exercise. Amendment No. 6 means that we are adding, at the end of proposed section 135a, in a definitional context, that `television broadcast' will now include audiovisual items. He is then going to leave out section 135b and insert:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a reference to an audio-visual item is a reference to sound recordings, cinematograph films, television and broadcasts;</PARA>
<PARA>My reading of that, and I may be wrong, is that it seems not to link films any longer to their broadcasting on television, but to have them standing on their own. I do not know whether that was the intention of Senator Hill's amendment. I hasten to say that I am not a lawyer, but my reading of it is that Senator Hill's intention was to include it with television broadcasts. However, as drafted, it seems to pull it out from that inclusion. I could not support that second proposition because, as I have just argued, I see them as being in two different contexts-two quite different markets and two quite different commercial operations. In the proposed amendment to section 135b, Senator Hill seems to take it back within that category by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a reference to a broadcast includes a television or sound broadcast-</PARA>
<PARA>presumably here we are talking about radio-</PARA>
<PARA>and includes . . . film included in that broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a reiteration of the Government's proposition, and takes it back into the same category. Senator Hill might be able to disabuse me of that, but that is my reading of his amendments at the moment. I could not support dealing with a film in that way because it seems to violate the whole basis upon which the copyright exercise is being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The next item, which Senator Puplick spoke about, is the revamping of the collecting societies. His passionate appeal for more than one collecting society arises, no doubt, from his desire to have competition in this area. I would not necessarily want to argue against that, except to say that the area is still a relatively new one, and I am not convinced by what Senator Puplick said, namely, that there is a need for duplication in that area. I accept the point he made that it is a dramatic exercise when one wishes to go from one society to another, but it may be that the very drama of that exercise-in other words, the winding up of the whole collecting society and handing it over to somebody else-should be more vigorously used to pursue those aims that Senator Puplick quite rightly raised. That is, the clients of the collecting society ought really to be the ones whose satisfaction those collecting societies should be seeking to provide. Where people are not satisfied, it seems to me that the Attorney-General may need to be somewhat more responsive. I am not persuaded that there is a need at this time for any more than one collecting society in any one area. After considering the material that has been provided to me, and some of the things which Senator Puplick has said, of which we have had notice, while there has been some dissatisfaction, I am still not persuaded that that dissatisfaction is likely to go away because there are two societies. Much of that dissatisfaction has arisen from the novelty of the situation and the need for these people to bed themselves down.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill's amendments would significantly enhance the possibilities of the collecting societies being able to perform the tasks that they are being asked to perform. I should have thought that it might be appropriate to allow that to stand and to review this at some later stage, rather than seek now to provide for more than one society. Once we do that, there are other problems that emerge pretty rapidly. At least, at the moment, we know that a collecting society has exclusive control of an area. If it does not have exclusive control, what does it have? Much as Senator Puplick may wish to make work for the bureaucrats who draw up regulations, I think that this could end up being a technical nightmare. I do not want to lend our weight to that particular proposition at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the points made by Senator Puplick do have validity inasmuch as the clients of these collecting societies are the ones whose interests should be addressed. I wonder whether or not there is a mechanism within the Attorney-General's Department to receive complaints of this type. Perhaps the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) will be able to inform the Committee that this mechanism is working and still working well. On the basis of those points, I am unable to support the amendments proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might deal first of all with the question of the collecting societies, because I think that Senator Puplick has made some points which, in so far as they have validity, can better be addressed by the Parliament at this stage in the evolution of the role of collecting societies of these sorts. From the point of view of users of these materials there is merit in an educational institution, for example, knowing that there is only one society to which it has to make payments. There is the simple question of administrative convenience, which ought to be looked at. Of course, there is also the question of the attitude of the clients, the users, the copyright owners. As I understand from the advisers, those people are quite happy, generally speaking. No complaints have been received by them though, obviously, proper representations have been made by some to Senator Puplick. On the whole, copyright owners themselves seem to be satisfied with the scheme of the single collecting society which is proposed. Clause 135p provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (3) The Attorney-General shall not declare a body to be the collecting society unless:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (d) its rules contain such other provisions as are prescribed, being provisions necessary to ensure that the interests of the collecting society's members who are relevant copyright owners or their agents are protected adequately, including, in particular, provisions about:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the collection of amounts of equitable remuneration payable . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the payment of the administrative costs of the society . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the distribution of amounts collected by it;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the holding on trust by the society of amounts . . . and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) access to records of the society by its members. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are important provisions, which give some protection to the copyright owners in relation to the collecting society. Though it is not necessary, because the Democrats are not supporting Senator Puplick in this regard, I think that it might be advantageous, since this is the Committee, to make a concession, in parliamentary terms, to the honourable senator. In relation to the annual report and accounts there is a provision in clause 135r which states:</PARA>
<PARA> `The collecting society shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, prepare a report of its operations during that financial year and send a copy of the report to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps amendment No. 17 could be adapted. I might propose an amendment after proposed new section 135r, perhaps a new clause (1a). I propose later to move:</PARA>
<PARA>`(1a) The Attorney-General shall cause a copy of the report sent to the Attorney-General under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the receipt of the report by the Attorney-General'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, possibly. It may be that the Clerk can make some adjustment at the conclusion of the committee stage. In principle, what I am signalling is that at the committee stage it might be useful to have a provision inserted concerning action by the Attorney-General on receipt of the report. Clearly, the first report of the collecting society would be of interest to the Senate. Members would be interested to see how it was beginning to work. It would provide an occasion for debate and for a review of the work of the collecting society. I understand that the amendment that I have moved is likely to receive support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the more substantial matters in the bundle of amendments moved by Senator Hill, I think that many of the points made by Senator Macklin are valid. I wish to emphasise that I think that, now that we have-if it is accepted in another place-a provision which allows for fair dealing, by students in particular, in a range of audiovisual materials, we have made a sufficient concession to the diminution in the remuneration that might otherwise be available to the producers of these audiovisual materials. The further step that Senator Hill has suggested is not necessary, and I do not believe that we should put in jeopardy the growth of this particular very important industry within the educational framework. Of course, the necessary remuneration for the very high costs associated with the production of these videos must be kept in mind if we are to allow for their growth and development in this country. For that reason also, I agree with Senator Macklin that the Opposition's proposal, in its substantive parts, as opposed to those relating to the collecting societies, should also be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had some discussions with the Australian Democrats on this matter. As I understand it, they have sympathy for our position, as it extends the provisions contained in the Government's Bill dealing with the copying of television broadcasts to include copying of radio broadcasts. That is logical, because there is no real distinction, from the point of view of an educational institution, between the natures of those media. They are similar, in that, once they go out, they are lost, unless they are copied and obviously, therefore, become very useful resources within educational institutions. The Minister sought, in some way, to distinguish radio from television by reference to section 200 (2) of the Act, which he said provided an existing capacity for the institutions to copy radio broadcasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty is that that capacity to copy is limited to broadcasts that were intended to be used for educational purposes. So they had to have been intended to be used for that purpose at the time they were made-a matter which is not, of course, within the mind of the educational institution. Furthermore, it has got to be the intention of the broadcaster, not any objective test, as to whether a broadcast has educational or research merit. In other words, what the Minister says is correct up to a point, in that there is a very limited exemption in the existing Act. But it is limited, and in a way that makes it very difficult to be used effectively by the educational institutions. I need to stress that there is no attempt in these amendments to avoid the need to pay to the owner of the copyright proper recompense for the owner's work. That is what we do; we set out a structure for payment. The Minister might concede that we are being more consistent with the previous position he argued today when he said that the owner is entitled to payment. As I read section 200, it does not provide for payment at all. So the educational institutions have come to us and said, `Radio is logically the same as television. Give us the capacity to copy it for the benefit of our students and we accept, consistent with the theme of the legislation, that the owner of the copyright is entitled to recompense'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the subject matters with which we have dealt in this series of amendments. We have attempted to incorporate within them the second subject matter that was raised under this heading by the vice-chancellors-that is, the copying of already published audiovisual material. As I understand it, the position of the Australian Democrats is that they would not accept that amendment at this time for the reasons that Senator Macklin has outlined. Therefore, it would seem to me to be sensible to split the matters that we have included in our amendments. I think it can be simply done but I need to ask for a suspension of the debate on this provision, in the same way as one other amendment earlier in the day was left for a later hour this day, in order that I might effect these simple changes, which I hope will enable at least that part relating to radio broadcasts to be passed by the chamber this day. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that is a useful reform. It is a further progression. It is consistent with the theme that the Government has put before us in terms of television. Perhaps the Government has failed properly to appreciate the limitations of section 200 of the existing Act. No doubt it would wish to be consistent and I cannot see any logical argument why the Government, in being consistent, would not support the extension to radio for educational institutions. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments deal with the familiar question of external students. I say it is a familiar question because I think even the Minister will concede that the Government is being lobbied on this question. Certainly the Opposition, and I have no doubt the Australian Democrats, have been lobbied by educational institutions throughout the country, including the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the Australian Committee of Directors and Principals Ltd, and also by individual institutions. One that immediately comes to mind is the Roseworthy Agricultural College in South Australia. This fine institution, which has a proud record, has some small external student capacity. I understand that it offers in the external mode a graduate diploma in agriculture and in natural resources. It makes the point that all these institutions have made, and that is that it operates within a tight budget and fears that the Government's changes to this legislative framework will result in greater costs to it which, in one form or another, get passed on and are therefore a disincentive to students. </PARA>
<PARA> The interpretation of the Government's amendments, which has been accepted by the educational institutions, is that they remove the exemption that currently exists for external study students. Therefore, the materials which are essential to the operation of external studies and which need to be copied and forwarded to students would come within the full copyright payment regime that is otherwise provided within the legislative framework. They were exempted before for sound reasons. I refer to the economic stress that is placed on students because of distance from education facilities and the importance of as much as possible putting those students in the same positions as those who live within cities and have much easier access to educational bodies. It is an exemption, and there is no way of running away from that. One can understand some disappointment on the part of the copyright owners at any form of exemption. I am aware that there is some disappointment in respect of the exemptions that are given to parliamentarians under the existing Act. But as there was merit in that argument, there appears to be merit in the argument that external students should receive an exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, that argument was found to have merit and was advanced in the report of the Franki Copyright Law Committee on Reprographic Reproduction which was referred to earlier in debate today by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). We have accepted the representations made by the educational institutions in this regard. Therefore, we bring to this Committee amendments 13, 14 and 15. Each of the three amendments covers the same subject matter, the first dealing with periodical publications, the second with anthologies, and the third dealing with literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work. But the scheme of each is the same. Persons undertaking a correspondence course or an external study course provided by educational institutions are to be exempted in respect of copies made for teaching purposes. In other words, the copying party is not infringing the Act by taking copies in a limited form which can be used for the educational purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, it has been argued that we should try to equate as much as possible the position of a student in a city, who has access to library facilities and who already has the advantage of section 49 of the existing Act, with that of external students who do not have that same privileged position under the Act. Therefore, this is an attempt to try as much as possible to treat them equitably. I commend the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I spent some time in the second reading debate dealing with the issue of external students. We believe that the people who produce this material should not have to bear the costs involved with assisting somebody who is disadvantaged by living in an area that is remote from the institution in which he is studying. Obviously there is a problem in this area. The Opposition has moved some amendments and I also have an amendment. I believe that this matter needs to be dealt with in some form. I have proposed a fair dealing on a literary work which, I admit, does not go as far as the amendment moved by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other than for lecture notes, which I shall come to in a moment, it would be seen as fair dealing for an external student to ask someone to make a copy of relevant material which an internal student would be able to make a copy of. In other words, external students would be allowed to use copies for the purposes of study that are obtained from university, college or institute libraries. The reason that we have gone this way and not the way followed by the Opposition is to try to get some type of correspondence between the two. I noted at the end of Senator Hill's comments that he also is seeking the same type of exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> My preference would not be to go down the track of my amendment either-in other words, that the Government would pick up the tab. However, I am mindful that we would be dealing with the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh). I must admit that I am somewhat daunted by the prospect of trying to get him to agree to such an exercise in regard to external students. It is important in a country such as Australia to examine this area. </PARA>
<PARA> My hope is that the distance education sector of our educational establishments will be far more highly developed than it is at the moment. It seems to me that it is the one area that is so obviously useful for Australia. Being a nation with a small population on an enormous land mass, one would think Australia would have had one of the most highly developed distance education sectors in the world. That is not the case. We have a very poor record in this area despite the brilliant work that is done by the people who currently operate within it. Most of them are operating with often inadequate resources and in outmoded facilities with very cramped conditions. They do an heroic task in the worst of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the problems of external students one is met by two things. The first is that unfortunately in Australia we are still largely relying upon paper. We are not using other electronic methods of communication to a very great extent. There is work being done. Some work is being coordinated, for example, by the universities and colleges of advanced education in a cooperative way to look at this particular problem. But they are not getting very far. In 1989 it seems to me that we should not just be starting; we should have the thing up and running. When we are looking at external students we find that one of their major problems is access to the library and, within the library, access to journals. In relation to the problem of access to the library, if we take the example of books, an enormous proportion of the cost of running external studies is carting very large volumes around the country through Australia Post. People would be surprised at the weighty tomes that fly around this country. That obviously is an absurd wastage. At the moment there is no more efficient way to do it unless some funds are put in for more electronic methods by which students could access the libraries, particularly journals and books. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, students who study externally confront an even worse situation when they come to the problem of journals. Even internal students cannot borrow a very large number of journals that are currently available in our tertiary institutions. The reason for that is that journals are a very expensive part of the library. Libraries have cut back again and again on the number of copies. To keep a complete list they almost have to make sure that those copies of journals never leave the library precincts. Under those circumstances an external student is massively disadvantaged in terms of current information. We need to look at that area and how to deal with it. On the one hand the rights of the person who has written the stuff must not be overriden in order to pick up a community disadvantage. On the other hand the right of external students to a fair operation needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Our method has been one of fair dealing. I am not quite sure which method the Government wants. Can I suggest it will have to have one or the other? I would like an indication as to which particular unlikely horn the Minister wishes to impale himself upon. I have worked through this issue for quite some time now. I must admit that I cannot see any other reasonable way. I have tried to limit my amendment to a form of literary works because the current context happens to be literary works for external students. I have left out lecture notes, as I say, because they are a particular exercise, as those people who have had anything to do with distance education would know. It seems to me that the lecture notes context is one that would be inappropriate because they are produced in the numbers that are necessary for the number of students. With the new context, many of those lecture notes are the precursors to more significant publications. As lecture notes are run off and provided to the students as part of the course they are undertaking, it does not seem that they need to be included here. It could even create a significant literary disadvantage to many academics if they were included. </PARA>
<PARA> All other works, however, of a literary nature would be included as part of a fair dealing operation. I imagine the way that this would work would be simply that the student would ask somebody, probably the external librarian in the institution in which they are studying, to make a copy for them for the purposes of research or study. In other words, to be a third party to do the fair dealing that an internal student would be able to do as they are on campus and these students are off campus. </PARA>

The Government had in mind that under proposed section 153c (3) of the Bill, which is inserted by clause 17, it would enable the making of regulations to allow the Copyright Tribunal to have regard to various matters in setting copying rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a regulation-making power; that is all it is. I want to describe the sort of regulation that the Government has in mind. We have in mind that the Tribunal would be able to consider discounting the royalty rate payable by institutions for copying for external students to the extent that the copying could be properly described as equivalent to fair dealing copying. This would avoid the possibility of any abuses that might occur if there were an outright exception, which is more or less directed to Senator Hill's proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be better placed, after examining samples and circumstances of copying by institutions, to assess how much of that copying could be realistically characterised as what external students could have done by way of fair dealing had they had access themselves to the material copied. It may turn out, in other words, that educational institutions will pay no more for copying for external students than they do at present. However, a benefit to educational institutions under the new scheme is the ability to operate under a much more streamlined and cost-efficient system from the point of view of their administration. As we know, the present system is pretty chaotic. Thus the new scheme offers clear advantages to educational institutions that should not be lost sight of. The needs of the copyright owners, which I think Senator Macklin is conscious of, are also protected in this way, but the task would be given to the Copyright Tribunal to perhaps, as I say, set a differential rate or discount the royalty rate payable by institutions for copying for external students when it has made an assessment, as it is best placed to do, of the sorts of materials which are called upon by tutors, supervisors or teachers to be made available to their external students. We believe in that way that many of the problems that have been identified and rightly emphasised by both Senator Hill and Senator Macklin may properly be met. I might think about this over lunch. </PARA>

Will the Minister decide whether an amendment to that effect might be a more appropriate way to go? Like Senator Hill, I find it very difficult to envisage upon what grounds one would make that exemption because potentially, as Senator Hill said, the entire library is open to an internal student. What students use is really up to them. Potentially none of the library is available to the external student. We are trying to actually bring them together.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter that I think the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) should explain to the Senate. It arises from a press release which was put out by the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding) on 3 May 1989 with respect to the future use of the athletic stadium, usually known as the National Outdoor Stadium, at Bruce. For a long time it has been the Government's intention to make this facility available as a rugby league stadium for the Canberra Raiders. Certainly I-like many others in Canberra-am pleased at the concept of developing the facilities to enable the Raiders to be a more effective team. They are an important asset to Canberra. At the same time, I am extremely disappointed that in doing so the Government intends to destroy the international standard athletics facility at the stadium. I cannot see why it is not possible to develop each of these facilities and retain the athletics stadium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that is not the only aspect of the matter I wish to raise today. In the press statement put out by the Minister two days ago, he referred to the fact that the chartered accountants firm Price Waterhouse has been engaged to negotiate the financial agreement with the Raiders. Further down in the statement it would appear that the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Administration will be leasing the facility to the Raiders:</PARA>
<PARA>It is proposed that the ACT Administration will lease the Stadium from the Australian Institute of Sport and negotiations on the terms and conditions of the lease are well advanced. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement refers also to the fact that the Institute's athletics warm-up track will be upgraded to a national standard facility. What I want to ask the Minister is: Who owns the National Outdoor Stadium at Bruce and who will be leasing it to the Raiders? That is important for the people of Canberra to know. The stadium was originally established by the then Minister, Mr Ellicott, as a national athletics facility. As I understand it, the stadium has been retained as a Commonwealth facility and remains so under the Department of the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. It has been managed by the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). </PARA>
<PARA> It is my recollection that when Mr Brown was Minister for Sport he intended that there should be a leasing of the facility, that he wanted to obtain a lease for the Institute from the Department of Administrative Services but that the arrangements for the National Capital Development Commission to define the actual boundaries of the facility were never completed and so discussions between Mr Brown and Mr Uren, the then Minister for Administrative Services, did not result in the lease being issued to the AIS. So I was somewhat intrigued when I saw in the Minister's press statement that the ACT Administration will lease the stadium from the Institute. At the beginning of these arrangements one of the stumbling blocks was that the AIS did not have a lease and so could not issue a lease to the Raiders, as it thought it might have done as part of the early negotiations. The question is: When did the AIS obtain the lease of the stadium from the Department of Administrative Services?</PARA>
<PARA> We all know that Commonwealth facilities are purpose-built and that when they are no longer to be used for that purpose they revert from whoever has had the use of them to the Department of Administrative Services. I think that is covered by the Lands Acquisition Act 1955. That has happened recently as, we all know, with the provisional Parliament House. It no longer being used for the purpose for which it was built, it has reverted to the custody or care of the Minister for Administrative Services. It is my view that the stadium is still a Commonwealth asset. The Minister's press release states:</PARA>
<PARA>It was essential to make these decisions prior to the establishment of the ACT Government to make sure the momentum of the project was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Is this asset, having been transferred by some means or other to the ACT Administration, going to appear in the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the ACT Government as a debt owing by the ACT to the Commonwealth, as will be the case, for example, with the Googong Dam and other facilities which are going to become the assets of the ACT? Is this a Commonwealth-owned facility; how did it get into the hands of the ACT Administration; is it a gift, or is it a capital asset which is being transferred? It is very important that answers to these questions be given. If it is a gift, I would then go on to ask, `What are you going to do, Commonwealth Government, about facilitating the ACT to get an Australian football team based in Canberra? The ACT Australian Football League is most anxious to do so. It has elaborate plans drawn to develop the Phillip oval as a suitable venue for Australian football in the national league. Will it be given the same sort of assistance to develop that facility? Will the Cannons, in time, be given the same sort of assistance to develop a stadium which will hold more than the 5,000 people whom they now attract to the indoor stadium?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan has raised a very good question. I am trying to find out what is happening. That is my point. What is happening? I believe that the Commonwealth owns the stadium. I want to know whether the Commonwealth is giving it or selling it to us. I think we are entitled to know what the arrangements are and how it can then be leased by the ACT Administration, which I believe does not own it at present, to some other group. These matters ought to be disclosed. The facts ought to be known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, it worries me a little when the Minister, in his statement, talks about the need for this to be done `before the ACT Government is established'. Three Ministers are involved in one way or another; Senator Richardson, Mr West and Mr Holding. Clearly they have come to some agreement about a Commonwealth facility. They are planning that it be available to be leased by the ACT Administration to the Raiders. I would like to know what arrangements these Ministers have come to between themselves. I doubt whether in New South Wales, Western Australia or Queensland an asset of this size would be just given by the Commonwealth Government to the State Government. Doubting that, I wonder whether that is what is happening here. If it is, the Government should clearly say so and we would say, `Thank you very much'. The fact that the Government has not said so is what concerns me, as does the value at which this asset will be transferred and the value at which it will have to be paid back by the people of the ACT in the future arrangement. I hope that the Minister will make a statement and put the matter beyond doubt as to who owns the facility and what the legal situation is, so that all of us will know. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the content of the Minister's press release headed `Raiders Relocation to Bruce', dated 3 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RAIDERS RELOCATION TO BRUCE</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Arts and Territories, Clyde Holding, today announced the engagement of Price Waterhouse, Chartered Accountants, to negotiate a financial agreement with the Canberra Raiders for the long term hiring of the National Outdoor Stadium at Bruce. Price Waterhouse will negotiate on behalf of the ACT Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The finalisation of financial arrangements with the Raiders is an important step in ensuring the successful relocation of the Raiders to Bruce for the 1990 football season,'' Mr Holding said. </PARA>
<PARA> To allow the Raiders to move to Bruce, an undertaking was given that the Stadium would be redeveloped to make it suitable for rugby league and other field sports. In addition, athletics facilities will be provided by upgrading the existing athletics warm-up track to a national standard facility. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Design work for the redevelopment of the Stadium and the athletics track is almost complete. All parties have been working closely together to ensure the facilities meet user requirements and that the timetable for the Raiders to commence at Bruce in 1990 is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It is proposed that the ACT Administration will lease the Stadium from the Australian Institute of Sport and negotiations on the terms and conditions of the lease are well advanced,'' said Mr Holding. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It was essential to make these decisions prior to the establishment of the ACT Government to make sure the momentum of the project was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I believe it is very important that the high quality facilities at Bruce are redeveloped as soon as possible for the benefit of the ACT community,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Not only will the Raiders have a significantly improved home ground, but it will also be possible for other field sports to make use of this community asset. The ACT athletics community will have access to a national standard athletics field with a new grandstand and associated administrative facilities.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add further to the case I have been building over a series of weeks in relation to allegations of corrupt practices in banks in Australia. Honourable senators may have seen the cover story in the Bulletin of last week entitled `Why the banks are bastards'.

In the course of the next 15 minutes I will be seeking leave to table certain further evidence, as I have done in the past. I think honourable senators are aware that I have now tabled in the vicinity of 30 affidavits, sworn statements or signed documents in support of 35 allegations-very serious allegations-of corrupt practices in Australian banks. I seek leave, therefore, initially to table further signed documents and affidavits in relation to three further cases, Dunn in dispute with Westpac; Stay in dispute with Westpac; and Todd in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I will briefly elaborate on these cases because they are three further examples of the sorts of relationships which now prevail between banks and their customers and clearly illustrate, yet further, the sound and very valid grounds, I believe, for serious allegations of corrupt practise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look first of all at the allegations of Mr Dunn in his dispute with Westpac. It is typical of the 33 affidavits I have now tabled. Mr Dunn's accountant forged cheques on Mr Dunn's company at the Westpac Bank to the amount of $192,000-odd. The accountant, David Barr, was charged, tried, found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in gaol. The amount of money stolen from the company accounts by the accountant was determined by an audit, requested by the bank and paid for by Mr Dunn at a cost of $11,000. Mr Dunn requested that the bank replace the missing funds but it did not reply to his requests. Mr Dunn's company has now, apparently, in one fell swoop lost approximately $200,000 through no fault of its own. It was forced to mortgage its Mascot factory and property to find the funds to sustain the business. The two biggest creditors were Blue Metal Industries (BMI) and Mitsubishi. </PARA>
<PARA> BMI, with which Westpac had its accounts and whose managing director is presently managing director of Westpac owned AGC, suggested a scheme of agreement. The bank agreed that the Dunn home be transferred to a shelf company owned by the Dunns and began negotiating about the missing funds. Six months later, without the Dunns' knowledge, the business was sold. Mr Justice Needham of the equity division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales dismissed BMI's scheme manager for these illegal actions. Mitsubishi requested an investigation into what appeared to be a conspiracy and possible fraud. The liquidator, who had been nominated by BMI, then sold the Dunns' home and paid out the mortgage to the bank. The bank later settled the claim on the forged cheques on terms which were not to be disclosed and the liquidator received approximately 25 per cent of the total claim. Mr Dunn and his wife are now in excess of $200,000 at loss. They have lost their business and they have lost their home. The Dunns' case is not atypical of the 33 cases that I have now cited in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the case of Mr Stay, who is in dispute with Westpac. It concerns offshore borrowing. Mr Stay is typical of the estimated 1,400 cases of people in Australia who were caught in the Swiss bank scam in  1984-85. Mr Stay's complaint is that he received very bad advice about offshore loans from the bank's representative and that the bank behaved unethically, in securing its own interests in relation to the loan, far and above the interests of its clients. It is precisely this type of case that I was suggesting be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That proposition was defeated by the combined vote of the Opposition and the Government on 5 April. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the case of Mr Todd, who was in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank. He needed a guarantor for an unsecured loan from the bank and approached his brother, Geoffrey, who agreed to guarantee $19,000 by putting up two State Bank deposit stocks of $17,000 and $18,000. Mr Todd says that it was agreed by all at the meeting at the bank that Mr Geoffrey Todd was guaranteeing only $19,000 for a period of six months and nothing further, that he would be able to use the remainder of the State Bank deposit stocks whenever he wished, that they were not part of the guarantee and had only been put up in their entirety in order not to affect interest earned. </PARA>
<PARA> After problems with his company, Mr Todd was told by the bank that the guarantee was for $35,000 over 10 years, and not $19,000 over six months, as he had been led to believe. Mr Todd's company was liquidated, whereupon the bank registered a mortgaged on Mr Todd's brother's house and then applied pressure to sell the house. Mr Todd was told that if he transferred $50,000 to the bank he would be completely released. He borrowed $50,000 from the CBS building society and transferred it to the bank, whereupon only $18,000 was released. He is still waiting for the rest of the money. </PARA>
<PARA> I have cited only three further examples. Progressively each week I will cite and build up more and more evidence which typifies these cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all substantiated. I can provide the substantiating documentary evidence. In my remaining time, I would like to turn to a very serious matter indeed. On 5 April the Senate debated my proposition that the matter of alleged corrupt practices in banking be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As I said, it was defeated by a combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. In that debate, Senator Stone, responding on behalf of the coalition, cited, tabled and had incorporated in Hansard five personal letters from the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank to me. Mr Don Sanders, the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, has written five letters to me. Senator Stone apparently had been supplied with copies of those letters and he chose, as part of his contribution to the debate, to incorporate in Hansard four of those five letters. I had neither responded to those letters personally, nor had I tabled them in the Senate because I was continuing my analysis of what they told me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major thrusts of Senator Stone's criticisms was that I had not been doing my homework. I have spent literally thousands of hours, in relation to the hundreds of cases that I have before me, doing homework on this issue. Senator Stone claimed that I had not been doing my homework and chose to table and incorporate in Hansard four personal letters on which I had not yet finished my homework, and about which he obviously had not done his. I now wish to cite the implications of two of those letters because they are in Hansard, they contain inaccurate statements, they are grossly misleading and they warrant correction. I will now cite for the Senate and table documents which I hope will rectify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the letters was the Commonwealth Bank's explanation of what had happened in relation to the Great Australian Hat Company in Western Australia. Mr Sanders said that an earlier document, an affidavit, that I had tabled which said that the Great Australian Hat Company had been virtually stolen by a former manager of the Commonwealth Bank in Western Australia for a sum of $200,000 or less was inaccurate, and that the business had changed hands on 17 August 1988 at a figure of $990,000. He actually cited the contract in his letter. That contract never existed. It may have been drafted. It may, perhaps, on 17 August have been intended, but it was never put into effect. The business was actually sold two months later. After considerable duress and enormous pressure upon Mr Derek Gilliland, the owner of the business, it was sold for less than $200,000, a 400 per cent difference in the figure cited by Mr Don Sanders. He cited a contract which was never put into effect. I seek leave to table the contract which did effect the transfer of that business-at a cost of less than $200,000, not at a price of $900,000, as had been misrepresented in Mr Sanders's letter to me. That misrepresentation was tabled by Senator Stone in support and defence of his former colleague and manager of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Sanders. </PARA>

Included in the TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($200,000.00) was EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($80,000.00) worth of plant and equipment. In actual fact Gannon obtained this multi million dollar company for ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($125,000.00). I was forced to sell THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN HAT COMPANY to Mr Clem Gannon (member of the WACA and Umpire) by sustained threats and harassment from my Bank Manager Mr Hugh Beavan (Member of the WACA and chief selector of the West Australian Cricket team) and his assistant Mr Scott McClelland. The sustained harassment and threats against me, my dogs and horses brought me to the verge of a nervous breakdown. I signed the Sale Agreement without even showing it to my accountant or solicitor. </PARA>

In Tasmania a higher proportion of land, 22.6 per cent, is set aside for recreation and conservation than in any other State of the Commonwealth. Tasmania's central plateau region is one of the world's last publicly accessible wild trout fisheries and my State possesses the finest brown trout angling in the southern hemisphere, providing all brown trout stocks in Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of education, Tasmania remains at the forefront. In 1869 Tasmania became the first colony in the British Empire to make school attendance compulsory. In 1946 it became the first Australian State to make school attendance mandatory up to the age of 16 years. Tasmania's school expenditure per student exceeds the Australian average by nine per cent. Under the policies pursued by the Tasmanian Liberal Government, State charges and taxes have been kept amongst the lowest in the Commonwealth. For example, pay-roll tax is about 20 per cent below the national average. The cost of employing private sector workers is nearly nine per cent lower in Tasmania than the national average and labour on-costs for each employee are significantly lower than the national average. Tasmania's hydro-electric scheme continues to provide clean, efficient power, with domestic electricity prices being about 20 per cent below the average of other States. One fact that may be of interest to honourable senators is that Tasmania generates twice as much electricity from hydro resources as does the Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In the agricultural field Tasmania also leads the way. More than 27 per cent of the State is used for primary production. My State produces more than 60 per cent of Australia's processed peas and has the world's largest lavender farm. Tasmania is free of any diseases which plague mainland primary producers, including Mediterranean fruit fly, anthrax, blue tongue, Q fever and rinderpest. Tasmania has the largest quail producing enterprise in the nation and is the only State with a duck breeding program. Tasmania produces the largest quantity of onions of any State. One interesting statistic to ponder is that Tasmanian dairy cows actually produce more milk than other States-over 3,705 litres per cow each year. Other States produce on average 200 litres less. If I add Tasmania's unique leatherwood honey, its top woollen carpets, its first class furniture, such as the Hansard table in this chamber, its wines and its internationally renowned cream and cheeses, it is clear that Tasmania has a great deal to offer. Although we are only a small State with about three per cent of the national population, some of the facts that I have mentioned show that Tasmania is more than pulling its weight to bolster and invigorate the national economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 June 1987, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, announced the opening of his campaign for the election that he had called because he had seen a political opportunity of being re-elected. He announced that the great agenda for the Hawke Government during its third term would be micro-economic reform. One of the areas where he announced there would be major micro-economic reform was broadcasting. The Prime Minister, in that campaign policy launch, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Labor proposes also to reform substantially the Broadcasting Act, rendering this nightmarish piece of legislation simpler, easier to understand and administer and shorn of unnecessary burdens currently suffered by licensees and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that, like every other area, there has been no micro-economic reform in the broadcasting area, notwithstanding the rhetoric of the Prime Minister or the grand promises that he made in that speech and subsequently. There has been no micro-economic reform. What we have had in the broadcasting area are insignificant, minor Bills, such as this one-so unimportant that it is debated during a Thursday lunchtime. There will be no discussion about it and no major speeches from the Government about it. The Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, will not even be present in the chamber while the Bill is being debated, because it is so insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill fixes up some mistakes to do with the grandfathering clauses in an earlier piece of legislation, the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill. They are absolutely insignificant and not worthwhile dealing any further with. There are major matters of concern to all who are interested in broadcasting which have not been dealt with by this Government, but have been allowed to lapse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention the inaction of the Minister, Mr Willis, who has taken over the portfolio of Transport and Communications. Three months ago I asked for a departmental briefing on a very minor matter that was stage two of the Government's announced national metropolitan radio plan. Every other department that I have ever been involved with has been able to provide me with a briefing within 48 hours. I know that this Department was able to provide me with a briefing within 48 hours because my staff was told that the briefing was ready, but that the Minister wanted to have a look at it before the departmental officer came to speak with me about the matter-as if the departmental officer was going to tell me something of major significance that the Government did not want me to know. The Department was also talking about sending over with the departmental officer an officer from Minister Willis's personal staff. What happened? I had requested the briefing repeatedly. My staff had requested it repeatedly. At one stage we were told that the briefing had been taken by Minister Willis overseas, so that he could consider it while he was there. Glory be! A departmental briefing was requested for a shadow Minister, and the Minister is so reluctant to allow anyone to know what is going on in his department that three months later I still have not received the departmental briefing. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an indication of the snail-like pace that this Minister is displaying in relation to the whole of his portfolio. He has been given one of the major portfolios of the Hawke Government-Transport and Communications, an area where micro-economic reform is absolutely essential to the future of this country. This country is going down the drain at the rate of $15 billion a year. Micro-economic reform is the one area where the Government can actually do something to address the issues, and the Government has given the major portfolio to Minister Willis, who is incapable of crawling anywhere at any pace to do anything. It is a disgrace that the Prime Minister does not call him in and remind him of the agenda that the Prime Minister announced in 1987 for bringing in micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Ownership and Control Bill (No. 2) 1988, this Bill, was introduced in the other chamber in November last year. The Bill has taken until May this year to get into the Senate and it is absolutely, totally insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about the lack of powers of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as it faces the problem of how it is going to deal with the Bond matter? That is a matter of major importance. What is the Government doing about it? It is doing absolutely nothing. There are no Bills before us, no proposals, no press releases, no statements-nothing. The Government will allow the Broadcasting Tribunal to get further and further along the road, give it no help, force it ultimately either to make the terrible decision it is faced with, or do nothing. The Prime Minister, this Minister and this Government have known about this problem for 18 months. Fifteen to 18 months ago it was mentioned by the Chairman of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give a practical example. Recently there was an application for the renewal of a television licence for television station BKN in Broken Hill. The question of the adequacy and comprehensiveness of the service was canvassed and the member for the Broadcasting Tribunal who was dealing with the matter found that the service was not adequate and comprehensive. So she found against the television station, but she could do nothing about it other than to revoke the licence. She knew that if she revoked the licence the people of Broken Hill would not have a television service. So what did she do? She had to renew the licence because she was not prepared to deprive the people of Broken Hill of the service. That example has nothing to do with the Bond matter, but it is the sort of problem which the Broadcasting Tribunal is now being confronted with in regard to the Bond matter-and this Government does absolutely nothing. There is not even a press release-not a Bill rushed through the Parliament to give the Tribunal some additional powers to cope with its problem-nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about audience reach? We know that in the television area at least two networks appear to have exceeded the statutory limitation of 60 per cent of audience reach, and what are those companies to do about it? It appears that they may be forced to divest themselves of some of their licence ownership. Who will suffer? The people who will suffer will be the people of Adelaide because the licences that would most easily be disposed of are the licences for Adelaide. That would mean that there would be a network all around Australia except for Adelaide. The people of Sydney, the people of Melbourne, the people of the other capital cities would be part of the network, but the people of Adelaide would not. They may be able to buy into the network-they may be able to use the network in some way or other-but their companies would have an insignificant input into the nature of the programs being put on the network because they themselves would be so insignificant. So the people of South Australia, the people of Adelaide, are the people who will suffer as a result, again, of this Government's inaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The current audience reach limit is 60 per cent, but the coalition policy is to extend it to 100 per cent if the Government does certain things to free up that sector of the broadcasting network. We have said that the Government should allow the introduction of pay and cable television, which it is doing in some respects in a Bill we have before us for consideration at present. It should substantially streamline the television licensing procedure. It should enact cross-media ownership rules between pay and cable television, which it is not doing, and it should order an inquiry by the Tribunal into the issuing of new television licences. We have said that if these things were done we would support a 100 per cent audience reach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy is to extend the audience reach from 60 per cent to 75 per cent, but is the Parliament going to be given the opportunity to consider any of these matters? No, certainly not under Minister Willis. Certainly, in no way under Minister Willis will anything be done which in any way might be controversial or which might bring the matter forward for consideration or debate. Under this Minister nothing is done. Everyone has to remain silent because they are frightened that they are in the run-up to another election. They feel that they are operating in an area where it is best to do nothing. To be seen to do nothing is apparently more acceptable to this Government than to bring any of these matters forward for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Senate is faced with a minor, insignificant broadcasting Bill dealing with some technical changes to previous legislation. The amendments are of a minor technical nature. They involve no change in the Government's policy. They are irrelevant and uninteresting. That is what the Prime Minister brings forward through his Minister, Minister Willis. That is what the Government brings forward as part of its great agenda for micro-economic reform-the major piece of reform brought about by the Hawke Government during its third term. It is a wimpish piece of legislation that deals with nothing. It is all we have seen as the fruits of the Government's proposed substantial reforms of the Broadcasting Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Crimes (Hostages) Bill. In fact, the Opposition will support any reasonable measure to reduce hostage-taking or other forms of international terrorism. This Bill will enable Australia to accede to the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. I understand that that Convention was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 17 December 1979 and came into force on 3 June 1983. So progress would appear to be somewhat slow, but better late than never. We are prepared today to give our support to the measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that this Bill should be looked at in conjunction with other pieces of legislation which have been passed by this Parliament since the early 1970s: the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act 1972; the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973, and the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976. Mr Acting Deputy President, it has been the international experience that states acting alone have had major difficulties in deterring the horrific practice of the taking of hostages. As you might imagine, all sorts of international pressure can be brought to bear upon an individual state, a nation state, which is determined to act in a way which we would have thought was in the best interests of the world community, that is, to prosecute hostage-takers with all due force of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is equally evident that if states are prepared to cooperate and act together, the whole world community, provided that it can reach a common position, has the capacity to give that added strength to individual states in dealing with these international criminals. That, as I understand it, is the basis of the Convention, a convention under which the world community came together through the auspices of the United Nations and tried to set down a framework by which each nation state undertook to deal with hostages and to deal with other nation states in relation to hostages. I have on previous occasions applauded the work that the UN does. Often that work gets very little credit. This is another example of where the UN, as a framework for the world community, has been able to bring nation states together to reach a common position in dealing with this scourge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention, as I read it, provides that states will pass required criminal legislation, that the acts of these hostages will come under criminal legislation within the state and that they will be dealt with within the state in accordance with that legislation. Therefore, this Bill before us today creates new offences, particularly under clause 8, which provides that a person who, at any time after the Convention enters into force for Australia, commits an act of hostage-taking is guilty of an offence against the subsection, and hostage-taking is defined. The legislation also provides for offences for attempted hostage-taking and for participating as an accomplice in hostage-taking or attempted hostage-taking. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that a number of the States-States in this instance being States within Australia-claim to have criminal legislation that could adequately deal with these matters. Nevertheless, the passing of this Bill would put that beyond any doubt and would also make clear to the world community that we in this country are prepared to put into place a statutory criminal regime to do our bit to reduce the abhorrent international behaviour of hostage-taking-something that is rare in this country. We hope that it will remain rare. This Parliament, by indicating in this legislative form that hostage-taking is intolerable behaviour under any circumstances, is taking one small step towards reducing the possibility of hostage-taking coming to Australia as, unfortunately, it has come to other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the Bill, wishes it a speedy passage and looks forward to Australia acceding to the international convention and making further efforts in the years ahead to combat this practice in every reasonable way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the release this morning of the consumer price index figures for the March quarter, which purport to show a rise of only one per cent in the CPI between the December quarter and the March quarter. I ask the Minister: first, is this one per cent figure a quite spurious measure of the actual rise in prices during the March quarter? Secondly, even on the basis of the new approach to measuring the effect on the CPI of mortgage interest charges, which, under pressure from the Treasurer, he has not introduced, does the Australian Statistician also indicate in his release that the CPI increase in the March quarter was actually 1.6 per cent, rather than the one per cent shown on the front page of the release? Thirdly, why has the Statistician not also published, for analytical purposes, comparable figures for the March quarter, on the basis which he has been using for the past two years? Finally, does the Minister agree that on that previous basis the increase in the March quarter would have been even higher than 1.6 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To take the last two parts to the question first, I do not know why a hypothetical figure for the March quarter was not published on the methodology that has been employed for the previous two years. He then asked what that figure was. I do not know that either. As to the earlier parts to the question, no, one per cent is not a spurious figure. One per cent is the change, with the new methodology, on the previous CPI aggregate under the old methodology in the December quarter. I do not want to go into a great deal of detail about this, but of course the error, or the conceptual flaw, in the previous methodology-and I have been talking about this publicly for at least six months-is that when housing prices rose it was implicitly assumed, for CPI purposes, that the outstanding loans of everybody who had an outstanding loan had risen commensurate to the increase of housing prices, even though their loans, and therefore their interest payments, had not increased at all. It was a flawed methodology. I repeat that the figure of one per cent is not a spurious one. What the documentation represents is pretty clear. I wish to quote from the press release of the Acting Treasurer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(The published quarterly CPI increase of 1.0 per cent reflects the one-off step down because of the change to the new system and is not a true indication of the underlying rate).</PARA>
<PARA>Far from there being an attempt by the Government to misrepresent the underlying reality, there is an explicit statement that the one per cent figure does not represent the underlying rate. The underlying rate is more accurately reflected on, I think, the second page of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) bulletin, which gives the figure of 1.6 per cent that Senator Stone mentioned. That is the quarterly figure that would apply if the present methodology had been in operation for 18 months or two years. Either way, and it is not entirely coincidental, I understand, the annual figure is either 6.8 or 6.9 per cent. That is the true indication of the underlying rate-significantly below what it has been recently.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has earned, over many years, a reputation for the honest presentation and publication of statistics, unlike the previous Government, which, on the admission of the then Treasurer, fiddled the Budget figures in 1977, and unlike the last of the Liberal Treasurers who, in the week before the 1983 election, publicly asserted that the prospective Budget deficit for the next financial year was $6 billion when he already had advice from Senator Stone that it would be $10 billion. What did he do? He went out and fibbed to the public. This Government has earned a reputation for the honest presentation of statistics. It is not into figure fiddling, as was the previous Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I thank the Minister for admitting that he does not know why the Statistician has seen fit not to publish for analytical purposes figures for the rise in prices in the March quarter on a comparable basis to that on which he had previously published figures. On that point, would the Minister not agree with me that there was not the slightest reason why such figures should not be published for analytical purposes? Would he therefore agree with me that the Statistician should be persuaded, by an apparently very persuasive Treasurer in these matters, to rectify the oversight that he has made on this occasion? Secondly the Minister, in his reply to me, said that the one per cent figure shown on the front page of the release is not a spurious figure. Does the Minister agree that the one per cent figure is arrived at by taking the rise in prices for the previous two or three quarters, as the case may be, calculated on the old basis-what I might call the `oranges' basis-and the rise in prices for that period plus the March quarter on the new basis, or what I might call the `lemons' basis, and subtracting one from the other? If he does not think that is spurious, I would be interested to know what other word might be applied to it. The Minister says that the release contains a statement that the one per cent figure is not a measure of the underlying inflation rate. Will the Minister point out to the Senate where that statement occurs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid I did not hear the last line of that question, as some of my colleagues were getting sick of listening to Senator Stone's speech. Regarding what he chose to call the `oranges and lemons' basis, I think that is correct. It is the last quarter on top of three previous quarters, with the last quarter being measured in a different way. But it is not spurious. It is quite clear, both in the ABS bulletin and in the Acting Treasurer's statement, that that is a figure which stands alone as a piece of accurate arithmetic but does not reflect accurately the underlying inflation rate. The Government has explicitly said so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will try to get from the Statistician an answer as to why the figure for the March quarter, compiled on the basis, of the previous two years, was not published. Whatever the answer may be-and I do not know; I have not thought much about whether it would have shown a higher or a lower figure than 1.6 per cent-the figure will suffer from precisely the same conceptual flaw that the method of compiling the CPI which has been used for the last couple of years has had all along.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agreed with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in March that officials of both countries should meet to discuss Indonesian fishing activity in the Australian fishing zone, which has for some time been a source of concern in our bilateral relationship. Officials accordingly met in Jakarta on 28 and 29 April last week and arrived at a number of new arrangements aimed at overcoming problems, first, in the operations of Indonesian traditional fishermen under the 1974 memorandum of understanding (MOU), and secondly in the illegal activities of Indonesian fishermen in other areas of the Australian fishing zone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to table the agreed minutes of that meeting and its annexes. These contain the practical guidelines for operations under the 1974 MOU and also a map which indicates the area in which Indonesian traditional fishermen can fish. New guidelines to the operation of that 1974 memorandum add certainty to the application of rules in the MOU area and confirm our understanding of what is covered by the reference to Indonesian traditional fishermen operating by traditional methods and using traditional fishing vessels.</PARA>
<PARA> We have also given access to traditional fishermen to a wider so-called box area in the Australian fishing zone and continental shelf. This will simplify our enforcement requirements by more clearly identifying the area in which fishing is permitted. Indonesia has also acknowledged the need for conservation measures which have been introduced in the Ashmore Reef nature reserve and for the protection of wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA> Indonesia also recognised that Australia would take necessary measures to prevent any illegal fishing in the Arafura Sea south of the provisional fisheries enforcement line and off the north west coast of Australia where incursions occurred in 1988 and earlier this year. Again, it was agreed that Australian and Indonesian officials will consider ways to develop alternative income projects for villages in eastern Indonesia which are dependent on fishing and which suffer from economic pressures which tend to lead villagers to enter Australian waters illegally. Officials will also consider the possible benefits of a reciprocal fishing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> Officials of both countries have thus arrived at a package of measures which should, in my belief, go a very long way towards addressing the fisheries problems which have arisen in recent times. Earlier in the week they had made substantial further progress toward drawing up a comprehensive agreement on the zone of cooperation in the Timor Gap. The new arrangements in relation to Indonesian fishing activity in the Australian fishing zone, combined with the progress that has been achieved in the Timor Gap talks, are terribly important practical steps which, as I have already said publicly on a number of occasions, will give practical ballast to one of Australia's most manifestly important bilateral relationships.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the closure in Adelaide of Australia's biggest agricultural machinery maker, John Shearer Ltd, which has cost 300 jobs and brought to an end that company's manufacturing activities after a period of 125 years. Is the Minister aware that the company, which was making very considerable losses that had, under new management, been turned around to a profit, said that the April economic statement decision to end the bounty on manufactured agricultural machinery and a two-week strike followed by an unsatisfactory Industrial Commission ruling were the reasons for the closure? Does the Minister agree that the decision to end the bounty 20 months ahead of its scheduled expiry was taken purely for cost-cutting purposes? Does he further agree that this unilateral action runs contrary to and makes a mockery of his often asserted need for predictability and certainty in industry policy? Will the Government agree to apply the bounty not just to stocks as at 12 April, but also to firm orders held by companies on the basis of prices quoted assuming the continuing bounty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is no. The Government gave some consideration to whether the cessation of the bounty should apply in respect of stocks and it decided that stocks held on the floor, as it were, should continue to be subject to the bounty but that work in progress should not. There were very practical reasons for that which had been experienced before when bounties had been brought to an end. That was the reason for the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Generally, I am fairly well aware of the history of John Shearer Ltd. The company has been under financial strain for some years. In the past three or four years it has lost some $15m. No dividend has been paid for three years. The press release issued by John Shearer-I do not have it with me-adverted particularly to the industrial relations problem to which Senator Chaney referred. No doubt that has been a problem for the company and I will refer to some other views on that in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA> The performance of the agricultural equipment industry in terms of, for example, exports, has been dismal. That is due partly to the very fragmented structure which that industry has inherited. Senator Chaney would be familiar with a company like Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd from his State which was supported by bounties for a long time. Nonetheless, in spite of that support it went out of business in terms of its tractor production and was not able to blame the Government at the time for that failure.</PARA>
<PARA> John Shearer has received substantial assistance from the Federal Government, however, in various ways. It received $70,000 under the heavy engineering development program. In the period in which it was making losses, it received $1.3m from the Industrial Research and Development Board for the redevelopment of a new product. It received $748,000 in bounty in 1987-88 and $1.1m in 1986-87. As I understand it, sales have declined further in 1987-88. I do not agree with the view which has been expressed that the cessation of the bounty was a major cause of Shearer's closure or even led to the decision to close.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the industrial relations issue, I draw the honourable senator's attention to a comment in today's Adelaide Advertiser. The editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission yesterday ordered the company to resume past practices while the issue-</PARA>
<PARA>of compulsory union membership-</PARA>
<PARA>was negotiated-</PARA>
<PARA>a basic move in any dispute. Whatever may be felt about closed shops, Mr White-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the manager-</PARA>
<PARA>should recognise that the unions behaved properly in resuming work.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the bounty, Shearer has known for four years that it would be removed. When in April the date was brought forward, Mr White sought exemptions from the Industry Minister, Senator Button, for existing orders. This was quite reasonable. But it takes patience for such a request to be studied.</PARA>
<PARA>Such a request has been studied, although Senator Chaney foreshadowed my response to Shearer in his question. I have indicated the position of the Government on that issue.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Chaney also asked whether this was an example of what I meant by continuity in government practice. The answer, I regretfully say, is no. The decision was made on the basis of overall economic considerations. It was made in light of the view that the bounty had done very little to help this industry rationalise, to help it improve its export performance, to help in terms of the mergers that would take place and try to overcome the process of fragmentation. The Government has in mind to do some other things with this industry which might help with those processes which are a better form of intervention than the bounty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did notice Mr Hatton's call. I saw it on television and I read some excerpts in the press which were linked to an apparent desire on his part that there be a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Col Winchester's death. I took Mr Hatton's remarks much more seriously than the remarks a week or so ago by Mr Ahern who also called for such a royal commission. Mr Ahern was clearly engaged in a diversionary tactic to distract attention from his own problems with his own police force and the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct which is about to be brought down. Might I say that inquiry was aided in its investigation phase by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). It was called upon by Mr Fitzgerald to assist. But that is by the bye. Mr Hatton, because of his many years of active campaigning on the question of organised crime, deservedly enjoys a much higher reputation than Mr Ahern and therefore deserves a much more considered response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to his request that a royal commission be set up to investigate the various marijuana plantations that are alleged to have been established in New South Wales in collaboration between various members of the Italian community, it needs to be pointed out that the National Crime Authority already has a reference named Vigilantes which allows it to exercise the powers of a royal commission in regard to the matters of concern to Mr Hatton. Indeed, it was because the National Crime Authority had such extensive, extraordinary powers not available to ordinary law enforcement agencies in this country that certain committal proceedings were commenced at Queanbeyan and, indeed, I believe that four people have been committed for trial.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that those powers which would be available to a royal commission are available and can be exercised by the National Crime Authority in a way which, I believe, has been indicated by parliamentary vote, sanction and approval in this place, is the better way to go, namely, that an inquiry be conducted using those special powers in private, not in the full glare of publicity where accusations made may prove to be unfounded, in a way which allows the gathering of admissible evidence so that prosecutions may take place.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the question of a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Winchester's killing, honourable senators will be aware that yesterday, I think it was, the Chief Magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory, Mr Ron Cahill, indicated that he will begin a formal inquest on 15 May and in that matter he will be assisted by Mr John Dee, QC, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions. This will be a most important forum for an examination of these matters. Because it is the task of the coroner to reach a conclusion as to the manner and cause of Mr Winchester's death, the conduct of the Australian Federal Police in conducting these investigations will be made public. He will have to examine all the various theories, speculations and courses of investigation that have been spoken about.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by Mr Cahill to set that particular date has been, of course, a matter of discussion between the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Commissioner of the AFP and Mr Cahill. Mr Cahill has properly made that decision and I believe that it is in that forum that much will be revealed which will enable the community and indeed this chamber for that matter to come to a proper assessment of the very proper, exhaustive, extensive and excellent inquiries being undertaken by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>

I am quite prepared to accept his moment of glory as long as I discharge my duties correctly. Of the matters that Senator McLean has brought to our attention over the past several months, my office has forwarded to the AFP copies of all materials tabled by Senator McLean since December. I have been advised by the AFP that it has examined all of the documents and that investigations were conducted into one of the cases raised by Senator McLean. It was a matter that was already under investigation by the AFP before Senator McLean began his campaign. These investigations were completed by the AFP and no evidence was found to corroborate the allegations that Senator McLean put forward. The final page of the memorandum to me, which is dated 31 March and signed by P. J. Lamb, Assistant Commissioner Investigations, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In summary, the AFP has examined the papers tabled by Senator McLean and forwarded by your senior private secretary in December 1988 and March 1989. Apart from the Poppet case, referred to above, which has been investigated we do not propose to investigate the other matters unless we receive evidence to support allegations that Commonwealth laws have been breached.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the matters which Senator McLean raised, many do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police in that they do not, on the face of it, disclose any breach of Commonwealth law. Many of the matters to which he referred either fell within State jurisdictions or appeared to be matters for civil litigation. In fact, as we know, many of the matters are, indeed, before courts for civil judgment. The AFP cannot follow up matters which do not come within its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Senator McLean's constant requests that matters be followed up, the AFP has the task of marshalling its resources in order to fight organised crime and deal with major fraud against the Commonwealth and other breaches of Commonwealth law. It cannot devote trained investigators to the time-consuming pursuit of allegations about which there is no sufficient evidence. I cannot direct the AFP to chase every rabbit into its hole in the way that Senator McLean might do if he were in charge of the Investigations Division of the Australian Federal Police.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not a great deal that I want to add to the answer which the Prime Minister gave yesterday. On the other hand, I would not mind subtracting a few things. Let me make a few quick points in response to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the resolution addressed and condemned specific incidents of human rights abuse in the occupied territories which appeared to be manifestly in violation of internationally-accepted standards. It was adopted by a vote of 129 in favour, two against and one abstention. Neither the Prime Minister nor anybody else has suggested, publicly or privately, that Australia's vote in favour of that resolution was misdirected-nobody, that is, with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition who seems to believe that it was.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Australia's vote on that resolution was not in any way a departure from our past policy or position on these issues. Similar resolutions were supported at the United Nations General Assemblies in 1987 and 1988. Mr Hawke wrote to Prime Minister Shamir in early 1988 on the question of Israeli human rights abuse, including deaths and beatings among the civilian population, and a number of representations have been made on individual cases and issues.</PARA>
<PARA> The third point that I make is that on the most controversial part of the resolution, that dealing with freedom of religion, the basic information on which Australia founded its response relating to restrictions imposed following an incident at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on 7 April at the beginning of Ramadan, does not, to the knowledge of our embassy in Tel Aviv, appear to have been subsequently challenged. I have spelled out in considerably more detail our understanding of those detailed circumstances in a letter that I will be sending today in reply to Jewish community leaders. I do not think I need to go into all that now.</PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point is that Dr Wilenski's statement, which was cleared across my desk-and I accept responsibility for it-contained at least three qualifying or balancing elements. It noted that we had not, at that stage, received definite accounts about some of the incidents which were referred to and the making of final judgments may be premature. I add to put it in context that such further accounts which we have heard have not altered our understanding of the situation. The ambassador's speech did note that Australia would continue to abhor the use of violence by all parties in the dispute. It also expressed Australia's firm commitment to Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point that I make is that debates on United Nations General Assembly resolutions of this kind are not usually regarded as occasions for making comprehensive statements of national policy, and certainly was not so regarded on this occasion. The debate, as did the resolution to which it was responding, addressed specific incidents of human rights abuse in the occupied territories, as was referred to in that resolution. Nevertheless, having said that, I concede the importance of acknowledging the very harrowing environment that Israel has had to endure since its founding, which it continues to endure and which must always be understood as a significant element of the background against which these incidents of human rights abuse-if they can be so described-occur.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge, as I acknowledged at the time when the issue was first brought to my attention in an amicable conversation which I had with the Prime Minister that, notwithstanding the points that I have just made and the elements of balance which were already in the speech, it would have been desirable to make some further reference to the security realities that Israel continues to face as it struggles to cope with the present situation. They are the continuing violence which Israel is experiencing within, but by no means confined to, the Occupied Territories; and the anxiety that country is constantly entitled to feel, small and vulnerable as it is and surrounded as it is by countries that have not in most instances been prepared even to acknowledge its existence. I have acknowledged to the Jewish community, and I do so now publicly, that considerations of this kind are appropriately recognised, or should be recognised in future statements of this kind by government spokesmen, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding of our position.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article and the allegation in it that the Opposition is planning to make income splitting part of its tax policy for the forthcoming election. I do not know whether that is true or false. Indeed, I think it far more likely that no-one in the Opposition has any idea where it is going on tax policy-least of all, I suspect, Mr Peacock. This issue is one that crops up from time to time, and it is important to spell out a few of the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the Government examined this question in the 1985 widespread review of taxation, and chapter 6 of the draft White Paper published that year sets out the issues. I will draw attention to some of the major ones. The first, and probably the most important, is that permitting income splitting is very costly to the revenue if no other adjustments are made. The 1985 White Paper estimated that the cost of doing it at that time would be of the order of $2 billion. Obviously, it would now be very much higher-perhaps close to double that amount. Assuming that the opposition did not want the public service borrowing requirement (PSBR) to be increased by $3 billion or $4 billion, or whatever the figure would be today, it would have to cover the cost of that change, if it were to be made, either by increasing the tax paid by other people-single people, sole parents, married couples with two incomes-or by cutting expenditure by several billion dollars. I suppose that, if one is guided by the Opposition's record, it is more likely that it would just allow the deficit to balloon out, as happened when it was last in government.</PARA>
<PARA> The next important point is that, among the single-income couples group, the greatest gains from such a change would accrue to those on the highest incomes. If both husband and wife work in full time jobs, each on average weekly earnings, it seems to me a bit unfair to make them pay exactly the same amount of tax as another couple who have the same total income but only one of whom is employed. Income splitting also has the effect of raising the effective marginal tax rate faced by the lower income earner of a couple, and of reducing that for the higher earner in a somewhat arbitrary fashion, which some people believe would have implications for economic efficiency as well.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, income splitting would add very substantially to the complexity of the taxation system-a matter which was emphasised in the recently published Social Security Review. I do not think I will bother to quote from that review, although there are some fairly extensive passages that could be quoted. The administrative complexities of such a move are set out in some detail in that publication.</PARA>

These arrangements apply to close relatives of Australian residents who have been seriously and directly affected by the conflict in the past three months, to the extent that they have little or no prospect of resuming their normal life in Lebanon, and for whom resettlement in Australia is the only appropriate course. There has been some concern at the inability of some Lebanese citizens to travel to Damascus to lodge migration applications. While normal processing will continue to be done in that city, I have agreed that my Department will place no impediment in the way of such applications being dealt with also in Cyprus or any other convenient location.</PARA>

What is the Australian Government's view of the outcome of talks between the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), Hun Sen and the Cambodian resistance leader, Prince Sihanouk, in Jakarta over the past two days? What implications will the outcome have for possible Australian involvement in a resolution of the Cambodian issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1798" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been encouraged-if I can speak for the Government-by reports that Prince Sihanouk and the PRK Prime Minister, Hun Sen, made progress in talks in Jakarta on 2 May. The areas of agreement include: changes to the name, the flag and the anthem of Cambodia and acceptance of Buddhism as the state religion; a cessation of external military assistance to each of the factions upon the final withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia; changes to the Constitution but with acceptance by both parties of the need to consult further on specific differences of views-that is to say, among other things, over the multi-party system advocated by Prince Sihanouk-the broad composition and role of an international control mechanism but with many contentious details left for further discussion; agreement also on another Hun Sen-Sihanouk meeting to be held on 24 July followed by a round table meeting of all four factions in Paris the following day; agreement on the convening of an international conference with sessions to be held in Jakarta and Paris but with details still to be discussed; and a ceasefire to be put in place instead of Prince Sihanouk's former insistence on an interim quadripartite army.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, notwithstanding all those extremely important areas of agreement, Prince Sihanouk and Hun Sen have failed so far to reach broad agreement on a number of what still remain major stumbling blocks, notably, the extent to which the PRK Government should be altered to accommodate the three other Cambodian factions in the interim period before elections, with Hun Sen resisting diminution of the status and the effective exercise of power by his Government. Again, with regard to the Khmer Rouge, Prince Sihanouk is continuing to insist on its inclusion in any interim arrangements which he continues to contend should be quadripartite in nature, while Hun Sen has rejected the idea of the Khmer Rouge taking part in an interim quadripartite coalition, Sihanouk arguing, as he has, that the only way to avoid a prolonged civil war is to include the Khmer Rouge forces in a national army. But that said, while Sihanouk is remaining apparently firm on a quadripartite government, he is also acknowledging that a tripartite government might well be viable if the Khmer Rouge refused to join. He also seems to be implicitly accepting that the interim administration of Cambodia would continue with the PRK authorities on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA> While it is the case overall that both of them have shown a welcome degree of flexibility, it is clear that key issues remain to be resolved, particularly regarding power-sharing arrangements among the four Khmer factions and not least, obviously, the role of the Khmer Rouge who were not represented in these talks.</PARA>
<PARA> As to Australia's specific reaction, we share the concern of others about the possibility of a civil war developing in Cambodia following Vietnam's troop withdrawal if the Khmer Rouge attempts to return to power. As we have said on innumerable occasions, we are categorically opposed to a return to power by Pol Pot and his senior associates.</PARA>
<PARA> A few weeks ago, on 6 March, in answer to a question by Senator Foreman, I indicated Australia's willingness to participate in our International Conference if it were invited to do so. Prince Sihanouk has previously indicated support for Australian participation in an international conference on Cambodia. He confirmed this to me personally when we met in Beijing in January and he did so again yesterday in conversation with our Ambassador in Jakarta, Philip Flood. As both the Prime Minister and I have said on a number of occasions, the Government is willing to consider any request that might be made for us to participate in an appropriate international control mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Kim Beazley, the Minister for Defence, is considering the possible logistic implications if Australia were invited to participate in such a mechanism. Obviously, the size of any possible Australian contingent would depend upon the nature of the peacekeeping or monitoring task envisaged. The Minister for Defence and I agree that the most desirable outcome would unquestionably be one whereby the commitment by the various parties to an internal settlement was such that only a very small external monitoring force was required.</PARA>

Without going through them all, I should say that in 1988-89 this Government will be spending $7.5 billion on age pensions compared to less than $5 billion spent in 1982-83. I could go on, but I would make a couple of minor points. The rate of single pension and married pension as a percentage of average weekly earnings is much higher than it was under previous governments. We have shown our commitment in that way. In respect of a whole host of incidental programs of assistance both in the area of fringe benefits, income free area, rental assistance and so on, this Government has a proud record of contributing a great degree of financial assistance to alleviate the position of pensioners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time back Senator Sheil asked me a question concerning national diseases control program termination, and I am now in a position to add to my answer on that occasion. Ross River fever, while unpleasant, is not a fatal disease. It is mosquito borne and can be controlled by reducing mosquito numbers. Commonwealth support of the national diseases control program (NDCP) since 1974-75 had permitted the establishment of infrastructures and programs for the surveillance and control of mosquito borne diseases. With the cessation of the NDCP responsibility for the maintenance of these programs and infrastructures reverted to the States. I understand that the States are continuing to undertake satisfactory mosquito control activities during 1988-89. The Commonwealth continues to fund research into vector borne diseases. In 1988 Commonwealth funding for research in this area was $148,230, including National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) moneys and in 1987-88 national diseases control program research moneys. This increased to $163,490 allocated by the NHMRC in 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some concern has been expressed that Australia's scientists who are researching mosquito borne diseases need special consideration outside the NHMRC because they are uncompetitive against other medical research scientists. This is simply not the case. The NHMRC has already recognised the importance and quality of proposals in this area and has provided funding of $418,600 since 1986. Without of course pre-empting NHMRC recommendations, we can continue to expect that high quality proposals from the very capable researchers working on the problem of mosquito borne diseases will continue to attract support from the NHMRC.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper extends the discussion which took place in the Senate the other day on a matter of public importance initiated by Senator Puplick. I stress again that we have in this country at present a Government which is anti-intellectual, anti-science and anti-research. The report contains a clear indication that the Committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), which framed this report, has been infected with the same rather narrow view of the role of science in society. It points to the inability because of core capacity to provide sufficient competence to support projected economic developments and to meet national responsibilities, whatever they are. Again, the emphasis is on economic developments. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out the other day, one needs to take a much wider view of science than that. Indeed, there is a need to turn around the perception which the public has of the role of science in society and the role of research. The Government is doing nothing in that respect. It has, by running down the capacity of schools and universities to deliver a good science program, been running down the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and universities research programs. Clearly this has given the public the view that science is not an activity that is worth pursuing. One need only point to an earlier report of ASTEC to draw attention to the incredible divergence between the public's perception of the need to put more funding into the environmental area and the way in which this Government has run down the funding in that area. I point to the science and technology statement 1987-88 report in which it noted in the environment area that long term trends were minus 6.8 per cent per annum, and that short term trends were minus 16 per cent per annum. That contrasts very sharply with the public perception of a need to spend more money in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We also observe as a result of this public perception generated by the Government a 40 per cent drift among the highest achieving students away from the area of science and into other areas of education. If we look at the Australian National University's matriculation marks for acceptance into science and arts and compare those with the situation that obtained only a few years ago where much higher marks were required to get into science-indeed many science courses were hard to enter-we now find at the Australian National University that only 270 marks are required to get into science while 281 marks are required to get into arts. In other words, there is a perception that a pursuit of arts is more profitable than a pursuit of science. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the post-graduate support scheme, we find that post-graduates-those who have ground their way through many years of tertiary education-can only get research awards amounting to $11,000 a year. This is at a time of life when many of these students are married and perhaps want to start a family. This is particularly relevant to women in post-doctoral positions. It is precisely the time in their lives when they want to move on in their careers and, if they are married, also to start a family. It would be useful if this report had made some recommendation regarding further support for married people in this very critical time in the development of their post-doctoral studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws attention to the need for more private funding. Earlier reports have pointed to the lack of private funding in Australia for research. The report correctly draws attention to the fact that many of the major companies in Australia are trans- national and carry on research overseas. This Government and indeed the Opposition by their deregulatory programs are supporting the intrusion of more multinational companies into Australia. Therefore we are likely to see less research carried out in this country rather than more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly to the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) report entitled The Core Capacity of Australian Science and Technology. I find right from the front page that it is a very disturbing report. It will be sufficient if I quote some of the early sentences:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is imperative that Australia performs them-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the scientific and technological factors listed in the report-</PARA>
<PARA>in such a way that they are able to contribute to that growth and to the quality of life. This involves the effective integration of scientific results and technology with economic developments and other natural responsibilities, as well as the production of a highly skilled workforce. There are worrying deficiencies in Australia's ability to pursue these activities at a proper level. Concerns have been expressed about the adequacy and sources of research and development funding, the deterioration of buildings and equipment, the adequacy of our scientific and engineering workforce, the paucity of good research management practices, the meagre attempts to increase selectivity and concentration of effort in research, and the consequent effects on research productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>What a start to a report! We know that this has been happening over a period of years. The situation has gone down and down. The calibre of the people involved is questionable in some cases. We now need to see what we can do to try to recover this situation amongst those involved in science, technology and research in Australia. It is a very difficult situation. We have to concentrate on reading the report's recommendations and thinking of what we will do about the increase in postgraduate award stipends, the increasing of research positions generally and the inclusion of a renewal of the 150 per cent taxation concession. All these sorts of matters have been raised in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Facilities and equipment are a very big problem. It is very difficult indeed for capable students, researchers and scientists to do the research that is necessary for the next century with equipment that is half a century old, in many cases in buildings that are half a century old or more. It will not be possible to bring this recovery about in the short term. The Government has to come to grips with it. I do not mean having a dabble with it on Monday night with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) trying to score a few quick points with a minimum of money. The restoration of the standing of the scientists will be more important than just throwing a handful of money at the problem. We have to show people in Australia that the pursuit of science and technology, and research generally, is a matter of great importance. We have to show them that the brightest people in the community ought to consider a scientific future as a real option. But with the state of the stipend that goes with being a postgraduate student, it is virtually impossible for many of the people we need to be able to carry on on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to come to grips with this problem. It is not just a matter of throwing a handful of money at it on a Monday night and the Prime Minister being photographed with a big grin on his face and saying, `What a great job we have done'. Having starved science and technology in Australia for the entire period it has been in office, the Government has to remember that the decline has been in its period. It must accept responsibility for restoring it. </PARA>
<PARA> The report deserves a full study. I have not had time to read it all by any means. I suggest that everybody with an interest in the subject should read it and it should be made available for study generally. I am pleased that the report has been completed. I commend those members of ASTEC who were involved in its preparation. I trust that it is one of the ways by which we will be able to retrieve our position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) made an announcement at the weekend relating to the 1987-88 annual report on the Australian bicentennial road development program. He announced that in 1989-90 major works on the Hume Highway, including the Goulburn, Yass and Mittagong bypasses and the Cullerin Range deviation, would commence. He said that the major expenditure would initially be targeted at the Goulburn bypass and the Cullerin Range deviation. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the end of 1993-94 work is expected to have finished on the Mittagong, Goulburn and Yass bypasses. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the Fraser Government entered into a commitment in 1982 that the Hume Highway would be a divided road in its entirety by the Bicentennial. That was one of its major commitments under the bicentennial road development program. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, quite soon after it came to office, endorsed that program. Several of its members were pleased to go around electorates beating their breasts about what this Government was going to do. I say to honourable senators that it is a disgrace that Federal road money has been diverted from the essential work of completing the Hume Highway, the most trafficked highway in Australia, so that it is a two carriageway highway between the Victorian border and Sydney. Instead the money was put into a diversion of the highway to Newcastle on the western side of Lake Macquarie. Clearly there were parts of that Newcastle freeway which needed urgent attention because of the huge accident toll that was taking place there. But the fact is that in respect of the Hume Highway, which is a killer road where in the last few weeks we have seen repeated accidents, this Government's actions have resulted in money under the bicentennial road program which would have completed those works in 1988 as planned being deliberately diverted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support gets up now and makes a big fellow of himself and his Government by promising to complete this work by 1993-94, just five years too late. It will be five years too late for the victims in those accidents who have already suffered and who will inevitably suffer further in the next four years or so. It is a disgrace that this Minister is patting himself on the back for putting out a statement saying all the wonderful things he and his Government will do which should have been completed by last year. My old electorate, which is now, unfortunately, represented in part by Mr Hollis to the extent that Throsby covers part of it, has already suffered in the sense that under the Fraser Government's clearly stated program, agreed by the States, the towns of Mittagong and Berrima were to have been by-passed by 1988 but, instead, only half that work has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement by Mr Brown is an absolute disgrace. We must get from the Government a full statement and a full explanation as to why this money was diverted from the Hume Highway to build a great and attractive concrete road west of Lake Macquarie, the traffic volumes on which would be a tiny fraction of that on the Hume Highway but which would serve the area represented by the then Federal Minister for Transport, Mr Peter Morris, and the area of the present Minister for Transport, Mr Robert Brown. If ever there has been an occasion of local pork-barrelling, this is it, at the cost of Australia, at the cost of the main infrastructure link between Melbourne and Sydney and at the cost of all those lives lost on the Hume Highway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Michael Baume on bringing to the attention of the Senate the very real deficiencies in the Government's present road program. We know quite clearly on this side of the House, because we have been raising the issue time and time again here and in the House of Representatives, how the Government has misled the Australian people and failed to meet its obligations to keep road funding up at a reasonable level. We know that the road infrastructure right across the nation is suffering through the neglect of this Government and its failure to meet the obligations which were set for it by the former Fraser Government, particularly through the bicentennial road program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to mention one other example of the way in which the Hawke Government, through the current Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) goes about misleading the Australian people as to what is really being done in the road area. We had a Budget announcement some months ago that the Government was proposing to spend $1,250m or thereabouts on roads in this current financial year. We subsequently heard from the Minister that that was such a wonderful amount of money that it would solve all the road problems. He then announced that over a five-year period something like $5 billion would be spent on the nation's roads, but when we came to analyse what the Minister was actually saying, we saw that he simply took this current year's figure, which represents a decline of something like $400m in real terms since this Government came to power, and multiplied it by four to get $5 billion. He then said, `This is some kind of initiative, this is a new move, some kind of promotion of road funding by the Government'. Of course, it is nothing more than just the use of numbers to make a somewhat larger number and confuse the public as to what is really going on. </PARA>
<PARA> But the daddy of them all was the misleading that Minister Brown initiated last weekend. Senator Michael Baume has drawn our attention to that. In fact, the Minister announced that out of the Australian centennial roads fund, his new development fund, he was going to spend some $2 1/2 billion on roads. This was presented as some new initiative with new projects in mind but, of course, all it amounted to upon analysis was, again, the use of the number that was set down in the Budget last year, that in itself representing a substantial fall from previous years under the Fraser Government, and multiplying it by two. He then set out to show that certain projects were to be paid for from that fund. He mentioned some of the things which Senator Michael Baume has drawn to our attention, but excluded others. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that the Minister keeps recycling stories about road funding and quoting larger and larger numbers to the point where he is becoming an absolute farce in the eyes of those people who know something about road funding in this country. He is attempting to mislead the Australian people by creating the impression that, by using different numbers for road funding, somehow something extra is being done for roads. In fact, the opposite is true. The fact is, and the simple fact remains, that since the Hawke Government came to power in March 1983 we have seen a fall in road funding in real terms of $400m. That is reflected not only in poorer roads and the difficulty which local government has in keeping up the maintenance of those roads, but also in the very sad effect, which time and time again is reported in our newspapers and on our television screens, of road accidents that kill so many people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume drew our attention to the recent calamity on the Hume Highway. It is time that this Minister started doing things instead of parading before the Australian people trying to create the impression that something is being done when nothing at all has changed since the announcement in the Budget last August. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief in responding to this matter. I want to make just one point in response to some of the comments that I have just heard on the bicentennial roads program. It is a constant theme that the condition of Australian roads is responsible-and according to some of the speakers who have involved themselves in this debate, wholly responsible-for serious road accidents, numerous tragic deaths and even, in some cases, perhaps even more horrible, disabling injuries that people carry for a lifetime.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. As someone who has had many years of direct involvement in this area, I will make a point that has to be made in terms of quoting horrific road accidents as evidence of the conditions of the roads around this country. In all the road accidents that I attended-and I have lost count of how many there were, but there were hundreds-I can honestly say that in eight years as a divisional officer with St John Ambulance I cannot remember one single serious road accident resulting in death or serious injury in which alcohol was not involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it clear that I am not suggesting that the conditions of roads do not contribute to this. Of course they do. I am not suggesting that this is in any way a defence of a lack of road funding by any government, but I make the obvious point that if a person driving on a highway, particularly at a high risk time, particularly Easter weekends and Friday evenings on the way out of town and Sunday evenings on the way back-I personally solve the problem by not even being on the road at these times-with his family, particularly young children, inside the motor vehicle, does not adjust the manner in which he is driving at least to be reasonably consistent with the condition of a bad road, in my view he is behaving in a criminal fashion. The difficulty is that so many people continue to do so. I have no doubt that we can all give numerous examples of driving in bad weather conditions-one of the principal killers-such as fog or heavy rain, slowing down to adjust the speed of the vehicle consistent with those conditions and having vehicle after vehicle overtaking one at high speed. Serious road accidents in this country are still, in the main, caused by driver error, not the condition of the roads. This is also the case for light aircraft accidents. Eighty per cent of fatal light aircraft accidents are caused by pilot error and not air traffic control or the condition of runways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that while Australians continue to think that they can drink alcohol and then drive, usually at a high speed and get away with it, there will continue to be the horrific road toll which we suffer in this country. </PARA>

I would not lose any sleep if the only people who were ever hurt were the people who were responsible for such behaviour. The great difficulty, of course, is that that is almost never the case. I know, as I am sure we all do, of tragic cases. I can think of one case in which the person responsible for condemning children to a lifetime of misery in a wheelchair got off scott free. The great difficulty is drinking and driving. I am not saying that the condition of the roads does not contribute to the problem but when finally Australians come to grips with driving responsibly there will be far fewer accidents and far less death and injury on our roads.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments. I have received a very disconcerting letter from one of my constituents. No doubt many other senators have received similar letters from pharmacists who are concerned about the Government's intention to reduce expenditure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) by some $31m in 1989-90 and $96m in 1990-91. My pharmacist constituent understands, as do I, that the latest proposal is to reduce the wholesale mark-up on drugs to 10 per cent; to adopt a professional fee of $3.30, which is less than 25 per cent; and to pay an annual pharmacy practice allowance of $15,000. This pharmacist from New Town, Tasmania, estimates that this proposal, if accepted, will reduce his return by approximately 48c per prescription which amounts to nearly $15,000 per annum. Taken with the previous decision to double maximum quantities, this will result in a further reduction of $10,000 in a full year. He states also that his wholesaler charges of 5 per cent loading on the cost price quoted for pharmaceutical benefit items, plus the normal increases in award rates, plus a reduction in the working week from 40 hours to 38, plus the 3 per cent allowance superannuation contribution, plus an additional rent of some $4,000-which are all the norm these days-represent a total reduction in his income of about $35,000 per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is happening to pharmacists around Australia it can only be described as a deliberate act of `pharmacy bashing' by this Government. I believe that the real problem, which is alluded to in the report, is the decision which was taken two years ago to include a range of very expensive new drugs in the pharmaceutical benefits list. </PARA>

The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) made it quite obvious that he was going to reduce the PBS by $300m over the next three years and this Government has tried different ways to do that. This latest attack is just another attempt to make the pharmacists the whipping boy and, of course, it is causing great discomfort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pharmacists, up until now, have had no real arguments with the Government but in my own State, pharmacists closed their doors for three hours. For honourable people to take action like that indicates to me that they are really being hurt. We can expect to see a lot more action by pharmacists around Australia if this sort of treatment continues. There is no doubt that we will see new attempts to reduce further outlays through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. I am very interested to see what will be said in the annual report next year when it is presented to this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always interested in keeping an eye on things to do with sport. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to comment on some matters contained in the Australian Institute of Sport annual report 1987-88.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This very interesting report relates to the period in which the Institute faced a Government recommendation that the Commonwealth Government sports assistance be streamlined by combining the Institute with the Australian Sports Commission. A fair amount of modification and adaptation has had to occur as a consequence of that proposal. In particular, there have been financial savings and benefits to sport expenditure. Also, there has been some rationalising of the use of the facilities. I believe, and I have heard no complaints to the contrary, that that amalgamation is proceeding successfully. I will be interested to read in the next annual report a description of how that amalgamation has proceeded. It is interesting to read about the sports which are promoted by the Institute and where they are located in line with the decentralisation of sport around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight a couple of the groups, or individuals, who have benefited from their association with the Australian Institute of Sport. One in particular who is referred to in this report is Kerry Saxby. Kerry Saxby is a largely unknown and unsung world record holder who is not able to compete in significant international events or Olympic events precisely because they do not include walking races for women. Still to this point, Kerry Saxby is not likely to win a gold medal in most of the events in which she participates and in which she holds world records, because those events are still not in the Olympic program. </PARA>
<PARA> Kerry Saxby has been extraordinarily successful. She holds records for the 5 kilometre, 10 kilometre and 20 kilometre walks. I think most honourable senators would know of her very recent success in Hungary the week before I visited that country. I would have loved to have been there to have cheered for her. She not only wins but she continues to break her own world record times. I am very pleased that Kerry has been able to benefit from assistance from the Australian Institute of Sport. I believe it is a hard business being a distance runner or a distance walker. I suspect that being a distance walker would be even harder than being a distance runner. Perhaps there is no way we can compare those two, but for people who are performing in those sorts of events and at that sort of level of excellence, something like the Australian Institute of Sport is very important for backup and encouragement, as well as assistance with coaching, assessment of health, provision of equipment and so on to keep people at that level of fitness and support. The Institute has an important role in contributing to some of our excellent performers. In particular, I cite here Kerry Saxby. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group of sportswomen that I would like to comment on who have taken a lot of assistance and support from the Institute is the women's hockey team. I am not quite sure what I could conclude here, seeing that the men have also benefited from the Institute. Can I conclude that the women benefited more and therefore won the gold medal, or is it unfair to make those kinds of comparisons? It is certainly true that the women's hockey team has had many of its members as scholarship holders at the Institute of Sport. Certainly we all enjoyed the game enormously. Many of us were in the same airport terminal watching the last 10 minutes of the Australian women's hockey game in which they won that gold medal. For once, honourable senators were completely unanimous in their decision. We were absolutely thrilled. I am also pleased to note that the women's hockey team, on returning to Australia, promptly lost its sponsorship, which seems to raise a question of what a team has to do to keep its sponsorship. However, I understand that in recent weeks or months Telecom Australia has come to the party and sponsored the women's hockey team with a very large sponsorship. That is also a matter for considerable celebration. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say that netball is a sport that has enjoyed assistance from the Institute of Sport. It is with great pleasure that I can say, following a letter I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), that there is now a Prime Minister's Cup for Australian women's netball. The first time that will be presented and won will be at the Esso Super League competition next year. It may well be that the Australian Institute of Sport netball team will be able to take out the first Prime Minister's Cup. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>I am speaking to the annual reports of the Australia-Japan Foundation and the Australian Heritage Commission together because I simply want to make a point very briefly about their tardiness. The Australia-Japan Foundation annual report first came before the Senate on 11 April 1989 and the Australian Heritage Commission annual report on 13 April 1989, covering the period to 30 June 1988. They provide further examples of disgracefully late reporting, reporting which would not be tolerated by the private sector, by the stock exchanges and so on where the public's money is involved. Here, public money is involved and this sort of late reporting cannot be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> What is particularly annoying about the Australia-Japan Foundation annual report is that the Chairman's letter to Senator Gareth Evans bears no date, so we have no idea when the report got presented to the Government. We have no idea why it is so late, particularly as it was audited, according to the Auditor-General's letter, on 22 December. In other words, there were no accounting problems delaying the presentation of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that ministerial approval has to be given to delay any report longer than its prescribed six-month period from the end of the financial year concerned. I wonder what justification was given, what excuse was made to the Minister and why he acceded to the request to table the report so late. I add in passing that I was interested to see that there was a 63 per cent increase in resources provided free of charge to the Australia-Japan Foundation, increasing from $286,000 to almost $480,000, meaning that the Foundation itself cost something like $2.3m of which only about $1m goes out in grants and so on to those bodies which benefit from this organisation. It seems to be a very large administrative cost to benefits received ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Australian Heritage Commission has failed to date his letter also, so we cannot tell whether the Government sat on the report or whether the Commission itself was dilatory in presenting it to the Government. This sort of thing has to stop. It is becoming a nonsense. Apparently, the Government has no control over the commissions, boards and bodies that it is supposed to supervise and it ought to smarten itself up. The Government should insist that these bodies behave in a proper and responsible way. Mr Galvin could perhaps get around to finding a date stamp and advise the Senate of the date that his covering note came. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder also what excuse was given to the Minister to enable him to agree that the report should be brought down later than the statutory six months, as required. I note here that once again the Auditor's report was December 1988, so there is no financial justification for any delay. The Australian Heritage Commission owes the Senate an explanation about its dilatoriness in getting out this report. Nonetheless, at least it did better than the Australian Special Rural Research Council whose report was dealt with here the day before yesterday. It managed to have its covering letter dated November 1987; it related to the previous year's annual report. It had not got around to changing the covering letter. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the . . . Council submits its Annual Report for the period 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it was its annual report for the financial year 1987-88. This sort of clumsiness by the Research Council I hope does not extend to its handing out of funds. It certainly does not say much for the Government Minister involved, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, who paid such close attention to the annual report that he did not notice it had the wrong letter in it!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters I wish to raise relate to an interview I heard this morning with my colleague the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Peter Dowding, a leading figure in the Australian Labor Party whom I hold in some respect. The interview related to the operations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in Western Australia. I regretfully advise the Senate that I will be canvassing this issue at some length later this evening. I apologise to everyone for that. I am not a consistent speaker in the adjournment debate, but it is necessary that I do so this evening. I imagine that I will be speaking for the full half-hour tonight. The report on the death of Malcolm Charles Smith is one of the matters to which I will be referring tonight in relation to the comments made this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is absolutely essential for the expeditious conduct of the Commission so that it can report by the due date that an additional commission be appointed in Western Australia. The major reasons for that are that Western Australia, with 34 deaths, has by far the largest problem statistically. The problem is complicated even further by the fact that, regrettably, police officers and prison officers are refusing to cooperate with the Commission. Mr Justice Muirhead, the original Commissioner for Western Australia, had his responsibilities as national Commissioner as well, which meant that work has not been proceeding in Western Australia as expeditiously as it might. </PARA>
<PARA> Premier Dowding has some concerns, which I share, about the appointment of a second commissioner on the ground that the royal commission was simply going over ground that had already been covered by coronial inquiries. My concern was not dispelled until I had read from cover to cover the seven reports that have so far been tabled. That concern has now been completely dispelled. One of those reports is the report into the death of Malcolm Charles Smith. I regret to say that the perception that the Commission is simply covering the same ground covered by coronial inquiries is not correct. Unfortunately, not only is the Commission not doing that but also its work has revealed the most appalling problem with the standards of coronial inquiries throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reports, among others, that indicates this is the very report that we are debating now. The coroner in this case found that Malcolm Charles Smith committed suicide. The Commission found that Malcolm Charles Smith did not. That is as substantive a difference as it is possible to get. Malcolm Charles Smith certainly took his own life and that was found by the Commission, but it was not suicide, and the evidence presented to the Commission, which would have been as readily available to the coronial inquiry, emphatically led to that conclusion. The decision of the coroner in the case was in fact wrong. On page 66 of this report we find these words:</PARA>
<PARA>I find that Malcolm Smith's death was caused by his own action in driving the paint brush into his eye with his own hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Commission said about this tragic and horrible death:</PARA>
<PARA>I find that Malcolm Smith did not intend to kill himself and accordingly that his death was not suicide. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission goes on to point out that the coroner also made an error in finding that Malcolm Smith had made two previous suicide attempts. The evidence clearly points out that they were not suicide attempts at all but were driven by the biblical injunction to pluck out his own eye. They were caused by an overwhelming sense of guilt because of a life he had taken and two previous attempts to remove his eye, one of which resulted in the lens being lost from the eye and the eye being blinded. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time available to me I conclude by saying that it is clear that the Commission is not canvassing the same ground as the coronial inquiries. It is, however, in this extremely valuable exercise into the deaths themselves, revealing some very disturbing deficiencies in the standard of coronial inquiries in Australia which, I have no doubt, will lead to the very positive result of a set of recommendations at the end of this Commission's work, leading in turn to a far better standard of coronial inquiries round Australia from which everyone will benefit. As I said before, I will canvass these issues at greater length in the adjournment debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The financial statements of the Office of Defence Production are yet another example of tardy, inadequate, incompetent reporting. This annual report was tabled on 2 May and, as I look through the Auditor-General's reports on the various factories under the Office of Defence Production I find that generally they were audited by 24 November or early in December. Once again I wonder whether the Government would like to provide us with evidence of the justification claimed and the excuses given by the bodies involved as to why they should be given dispensation to present their reports late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again we have an example of an inability to put a date on a letter. In his audited report on the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, the Auditor-General has inserted no date, so it is impossible to tell whose fault it is that this report was not presented in time, although the statement by the general manager and the principal accounting officer is dated 24 November 1988, so it appears that there were no financial reasons why this report should have been delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention in passing that the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow has managed to increase the value of its plant and machinery by 50 per cent during the year without bothering to make any mention of that in the written report. Apparently that is a matter of such little consequence as not to merit comment. The Auditor's report on the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory is dated 2 December. Once again the Auditor has qualified the accounts, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the `work-in-progress' component of stock was not subject to adequate stocktake or other verification procedures during 1987-88. Consequently the closing balance of this item may not accurately reflect the true balance. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say that, throughout this report, the Auditor-General has noted some difficulties with the standard of financial reporting by the bodies involved. The next matter with which I have some concern is the report concerning Williamstown Dockyard. We have continual problems with this. The Auditor-General, on 20 December 1988, reported:</PARA>
<PARA>Stores stock and work-in-progress were not subject to stocktake or other verification procedures during the period. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Due to the lack of adequate supporting records the following items could not be satisfactorily verified-trade and other creditors, prepayments, trade debtors, accrued expenses, provision for annual leave, provision for long service leave, contingent liabilities, receipts from debtors, payments to creditors and payment of wages and redundancies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a total condemnation of accounting practices involving multimillions of dollars of taxpayers's assets. Fortunately, the Williamstown Dockyard is being sold into another operation. I turn now to the Garden Island Dockyard, which has managed to make a loss of $1.9m on sales totalling $132m. The Auditor's report on this dockyard was dated 22 February. Clearly, there were financial problems in this respect. The Auditor-General reported:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I am unable to ascertain whether the financial statements are in agreement with the accounts and records of the Dockyard and in my opinion, the statements are not based on proper accounts and records. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely damning. The number of occasions on which we see organisations run by this Government on which Auditors' reports say that accounts are simply not kept is just unbelievable. Multimillion dollars of public money are involved. The Auditor-General continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Further, for the reasons set out below I am unable to form an opinion as to whether the statements show fairly the financial transactions for the Dockyard for the year ended 30 June 1988 and the state of affairs of the Dockyard as at that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The total amount of the discrepancy-</PARA>
<PARA>this relates to the balance in the trust account-</PARA>
<PARA>was not able to be quantified, although an opening balance discrepancy of $573,961 was identified. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement made by the Manager, Finance, of the Garden Island Dockyard says that the accounts:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in our opinion show fairly the operations and state of affairs of the dockyard except for the amounts disclosed for debtors and trade and other creditors. These items are not satisfied reconciled to the General Ledger of the dockyard at balance date and are therefore considered to be materially inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA>It is incredible that this sort of thing goes on. I suppose it is comforting that the statement then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There are reasonable grounds to believe that the dockyard will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. </PARA>
<PARA>I notice that this establishment, along with other government establishments, is to become part of a government-owned company entitled Australian Defence Industries. This organisational change came into effect from 1 April this year. This is an April Fool's joke. If this means that these bodies will no longer have to report directly to this Parliament so that we can scrutinise their incompetence and incapable financial accounting, this is an April Fool's joke in extremely bad taste. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the motion to take note of the annual report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of Australia, I want to refer for the first time in the Senate, but not for the first time, to a very important issue arising here in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The issue arises out of that section of the report which deals with the regional arrangement between the Human Rights Commission-if I might use that short title-and the various State governments to act in agency relationship on behalf of the commission, while also discharging their obligations under State equal opportunity legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made a call some 12 months ago for the Human Rights Commission, as it then was, to establish an office here in Canberra, not as a national office-I still support the transfer of the national office to Sydney-so that there may be effective local access for those people who need the assistance of the Human Rights Commission here in Canberra without having to go to Sydney. For many of us, going to Sydney for access to public sector instrumentalities is a very straightforward matter. Apart from that, there is the capacity to make telephone contact. However, the very nature of the people who need the support of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is such that they are less likely to have the time during working hours to go to Sydney or, if they have the time, have the money to make the trip, and less able to make effective telephone communications, if they have the money for the call. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra is the only capital city in Australia which has no representation concerning human rights of any sort. Of course, there are many States where there is an effective agency relationship, and there are other States which have regional offices of the Human Rights Commission. My first request was that there should be a regional office of the Human Rights Commission in Canberra. That is very difficult to achieve, is expensive and I understand the difficulties which the Commission has faced. But we are now in the situation where an ACT Government is to be formed next week, and I want to put firmly on its agenda, as a very high priority, that it should move to establish, in an agency relationship with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, a local anti-discrimination board which can deal with the relevant local legislation, some of which exists and some of which should very quickly be enacted. That authority could then act as the local agency to represent the Human Rights Commission dealing with the national aspect of the Race Relations Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and other human rights problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the demand for such representation is fairly easily discerned when one considers the nature of the groups which have come forward to support the calls that I and others have made to establish this Canberra office of the Human Rights Commission. I was gratified, in the first instance, to have the support of the Ethnic Communities Council of the ACT, because one of its concerns is that people who have difficulty with the English language, and who have recently entered this country, are disproportionately represented in their early years in the lower socio-economic groups of our society, and do not have the capacity to effectively liaise with a Sydney-based office, even if they are aware of its existence. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can get a one-stop shop here in Canberra, where they may not be sure whether they are dealing with ACT or Commonwealth legislation, they will know that if they have a question concerning discrimination it is to that office that they should go. That will substantially enhance such access to the rights of the citizens of Canberra, and the citizens in the regions of surrounding New South Wales. I hope that the New South Wales Government will see its way clear to make a contribution through the contribution it currently makes to the anti-discrimination board, and some of its work may be conducted here. Other groups, such as the Women's Electoral Lobby and the Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, have also come forward, recognising the importance of access to this very important body, and they support the call. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this call today will be the first in what will be a very short and, hopefully, quickly successful campaign to put on the agenda of the newly-elected ACT Government the establishment of an agency which can deal with anti-discrimination matters here in Canberra and be the local agent of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which, I hope, will be pleased to contribute to that agency relationship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, this is yet another annual report for the year to 30 June 1988 which has been presented to us in May 1989. Once again, it is unjustifiably late. Naturally I would like to know what excuse has been given for the Minister to give dispensation to allow this report to be more than six months late. It is supposed to be presented within six months of the balance date. The letter from the Secretary of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the Deputy Prime Minister was dated 21 December 1988, and presumably this report has been sitting in his office doing nothing but gather dust for at least five months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say in passing that it is unfortunate when organisations like this end up being used to make political scoring points about individual State governments. I refer in particular to the way in which complaints launched under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 are dealt with on page 27, where it notes:</PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelming majority of complaints made by Aborigines were made in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>While I recognise that that is a valid point to make, I am intrigued that South Australia, which has almost the same volume of complaints lodged under the Racial Discrimination Act, is not mentioned. I wonder why Queensland is picked out and not South Australia where 40 of the 205 complaints launched come from. One would have thought that that merited some kind of recognition. If it is to pick out Queensland, how about talking about South Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia, under the Sex Discrimination Act, seems to be going for some kind of record. Naturally, there is no political point to be made by scoring off a Labor Government in South Australia but there are points to be made against a National Party Government in Queensland. In South Australia, complaints launched under the Sex Discrimination Act 1988 totalled 188 out of 440 throughout Australia. That is an absolutely incredible proportion-something like 45 per cent. In fact, complaints on the basis of sex totalled 91 in South Australia, as against 193 for the whole of Australia. So roughly half the total number of objections under the Sex Discrimination Act related to South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the annual report of the Human Rights Commission. I want to refer in particular to two areas of the Commission's brief. The report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commission attempts to act as a catalyst in relation to human rights issues and concerns within the Australian community. By undertaking practical and targeted research the Commission is assisted in formulating realistic strategies and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>It also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the key responsibilities of the Commission is to conduct programs of public or community education in order to promote awareness and understanding of human rights issues. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of that brief, I should like to spend a couple of minutes on the question of the right to work, particularly as it applies to women, in the public and the private sectors. I intend, in due course, to write to the Human Rights Commission and draw its attention to the need to target research in this area and, ultimately, to create community awareness about two problems that I intend to raise. </PARA>
<PARA> The first problem concerns the question of the increasing number of women who are forced to do shift work or to go to and from work late at night, particularly in cities around Australia. In many areas where they work-whether hospitals, shops that open late at night, or other areas of employment-there seems to be a real problem in terms of security. I refer here to women who, for example, have to go to their cars or take trains or other forms of public transport. This is one area that I do not think has been considered particularly carefully by any number of organisations that have the responsibility to look at people's rights. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are talking about the right of women to involve themselves in the work force, and the fact that, these days, many women are forced to work unusual hours, it is important that the community recognise that we have to consider their safety, particularly in cities. That means that employers must look, for example, at car parks and at public transport. The authorities must look at public transport, to ensure that women have safe passage to and from work. Of course, this applies to men from time to time, but women are particularly vulnerable in this area. If one looks, for example, at the attacks that have been made against women, one finds that in many cases they happen around hospitals or other places where women are forced to work unusual hours-going to and from work at nine, 10 and 11 o'clock in the evening. Many of the institutions that employ those women have done very little about providing safety and security for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I wish to raise very briefly concerns the question of entry into the Public Service, at both State and Federal levels. Again, if women's right to work is important, if their right to earn a reasonable living is important, it is time that we examined some of the recruitment and assessment procedures that prevail in the Public Service, at both Commonwealth and State levels. For example, if one looks at the sorts of qualifications that are required and the salaries that are offered, one finds that there are generally two groups of people which broadly represent the type of women who come into the Public Service at a certain level. The first consists of graduates who, generally speaking, do fairly well. They enter at a higher level of remuneration, conditions and promotable positions than others do. There is another group-young women who come in at a very low level of remuneration and of grading. Then there is a third group, and these are the ones about whom I wish particularly to talk; I particularly want the Human Rights Commission to have a look at their cases. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the women who, for example, have qualifications that may not be at a tertiary level, are probably in their middle thirties, forties or early fifties, and are looking for employment for various reasons-maybe marriage breakdown, or maybe because the family is poor or the husband is out of work. There are various factors. Those women do not have the ease of access to the Public Service that they should have and, in particular, they do not have the level of remuneration that may be necessary for them to support a family. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the two issues that I shall be raising with the Human Rights Commission, in the hope not only that it will investigate this area but also that, at the conclusion of its investigations, it will be able to carry out community salesmanship in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. As I have indicated, my Bill does two things: firstly, it reduces the violence allowed in videos; and, secondly, it abolishes X-rated videos. As I have said, this is in line with the unanimous report of the Attorneys-General. Let me quote from the official film literature classification information bulletin headed, `Decisions taken by the Standing Committee of Ministers concerned with censorship matters in Darwin on 30 June 1988', which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All States expressed opposition to the introduction of the new `Non Violent Erotica' category as discussed by the Joint Select Committee in its recommendations. They also indicated that the present `X' classification would not be introduced to the States. The Federal Attorney-General indicated that he would take the matter back to the Government for consideration and the future of `X' rated material in the Australian Capital Territory would depend upon what the Government decides. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, Caucus decided against the advice of all the Attorneys-General throughout Australia. This Government is responsible for refusing to carry out the advice of all the Attorneys-General and the wishes of all the States. I was disappointed in Senator Macklin's speech. He spoke only about that part of my Bill that related to X-rated videos. I believe that excessively violent videos are of great concern to the community. I am sorry that Senator Macklin did not seem to think that that part of my Bill was worthy of mention. His major concern was that, if X-rated videos were abolished, it might send them underground. He likened this to the fact that making drugs illegal does not stop their being abused in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I would ask Senator Macklin if he were present whether he believes that child pornography, which is presently illegal in this country, should be legalised simply because some of it is available underground. I sincerely hope that he would not. There is no doubt that, if some X-rated videos and excessively violent videos were banned, they might go underground. But with child pornography all those young people growing up who will not seek the underground illegal market will have that material available to them at the shop next to the supermarket if my Bill is not passed. This material is being condoned by being freely available legally. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill pointed out in his speech, all the women's organisations in this country are virtually unanimous on this issue. Only one women's organisation, the Women in Science Enquiry Network Incorporated, opposed my Bill. But even that organisation believed that perhaps my Bill should attack the education side of this matter. I would like, once again, to quote what those women's organisations had to say. The Women's Electoral Lobby (ACT) Inc. said:</PARA>
<PARA>WEL ACT endorses the intent of your Bill to ban X-rated videos in the ACT. We believe that it is inappropriate for the ACT to continue to distribute X-rated videos in the face of the contrary decisions of the Attorneys-General in all States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Catholic Women's League says that it is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . angered at the lack of action on the part of the Federal ALP Caucus on the matter of X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA>It was unanimous in wanting them abolished. The Country Women's Association of New South Wales urgently requested the Federal Government to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ban importation, production, sale and hire of XER rated video tapes within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That organisation was very much in support of my Bill. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services was also very much in favour of the Bill. The National Status of Women Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee unanimously resolved to inform you that it supports your belief that the unanimous recommendation of all State Attorneys-General that X-rated videos be banned in all states and the ACT should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>The National President of the Women's Action Alliance (Australia) wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Women's Action Alliance is pleased to hear that the Opposition is taking this action, as we were most disappointed that the Labor caucus saw fit to vote as it did. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor member for Forde, Ms Crawford, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Children's innocence is to be prized and their introduction to sex should not be through a fifth-rate pornographic video. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Responsibility Department of the Mother's Union in Australia-it has members in 24 dioceses of the Anglican Church-said:</PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that it is illogical for the Government to support such projects as `Fair Go for Women' and `Affirmative Action' which seek to improve the status of women in the community while allowing the free availability of material which depict women as mere objects for male sexual gratification. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Church Women came out very strongly in favour of my Bill. The Society of Women Writers Australia supported my Bill. The War Widows' Guild of Australia also supported my Bill. The Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women Inc. support my Bill. The list goes on. This Government, which believes that it can ignore all the women's organisations throughout Australia, has a lot to learn. Women are concerned. Women feel very vulnerable. Yet members of the Australian Labor Party sitting opposite today are just not concerned at all. They show no concern in the matter. I felt quite sorry for Senator Zakharov. She had to resort to the Office of the Status of Women to get some support. She quoted it as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Office is satisfied that the guidelines, as they now stand, will operate in such a way as to prohibit such material as is likely to cause direct or indirect physical or psychological harm to women, while maintaining the rights of individuals to develop their own view of life, without direction from the state or the majority. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Zakharov could find only one group-the Office of the Status of Women which is attached to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-to support her view. Let us look at the evidence that that office gave before the Joint Select Committee on Video Material as it throws a totally different light on it. I would like to quote from some of the evidence that the Office the Status of Women gave. Early in its evidence I asked Ms Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA>Have you seen any X-rated videos?</PARA>
<PARA>She said no. Ms Knight said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the practice of the Office of the Status of Women to require personnel to view X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you! I asked her:</PARA>
<PARA>Can you tell me then how you have come to the decision that you are happy about it?</PARA>
<PARA>Those people had not viewed the material but their advice to the responsible Minister was that they were happy about it. I asked, `If you have not seen that material how did you come to the view that you were happy about it?'. Ms Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Office of the Status of Women is required to advise on a range of things with which we may not have personal experience, such as domestic violence, et cetera. We do advise on these things, taking into account all the information available to us. </PARA>
<PARA>My response to that was:</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you that I had no idea until I saw the stuff, and before that I would probably have given the same response as you. </PARA>
<PARA>Those people said that, when they were dealing with the old X-rated violent videos, they had put in a previous submission and that that first submission showed concern when violence was depicted. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, that is not to say that we as an office have not had concerns in particular about videos which relate to subordination and exploitation both in violence and other forms, but given that the expression of `violence' was our major concern, we have said that since violence was repealed we are happier with the new guidelines because they omit violence as an acceptable vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked, `What do you mean by ``happier''?, and Ms Knight said, `Well, that is relative'. I said, `Would you like to see any changes made?'. Bearing in mind that they had not seen it but they knew that it exploited women and made women subordinate, the reply was:</PARA>
<PARA>As I have indicated, we do have concern that any medium which gives expression to the depiction of women in a subordinate and exploitative situation, particularly in the sexual context, is an impediment to the status of women. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone in this chamber has any doubt that we have not at one time or another realised that we have become desensitised to the use of unacceptable language or to the viewing of violence either in the news or in films. We all know that today, when we hear on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts certain expletives in conversations that were previously considered unacceptable, we no longer turn a hair. We all know that this is fact. We do become desensitised. Yet there seems to be a lack of acceptance of this by Labor senators opposite. They do not believe that regular viewing of violence, and indeed sexual violence, so readily found in all these videos, leads to the desensitisation of the viewer, even though so many experts have brought this evidence to our Committee. This is just not acceptable. We must not allow, or even run the risk of allowing, these videos to desensitise our population. The cost is too great. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said that now that the Australian Capital Territory has self-government, he will pass the buck of legislation for the legalisation or otherwise of X-rated videos in the Territory. Obviously he is unaware of the fact, or has not taken the interest or the time to find out, that the jurisdiction for the importation of X-rated videos rests solely with the Federal Government-it rests with this Government and this Government alone. The Australian Capital Territory has no control over the importation of X-rated videos. Evidence given by the Attorney-General to our Committee made it very clear that virtually all the X-rated videos were imported, mainly from the United States of America. It is not the Australian Capital Territory Government that has control in this area; it is the Federal Government, and it is no use the Prime Minister trying to pass the buck. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month the Prime Minister launched Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I ask: How sincere is he? The Prime Minister should understand, although I am sure he does not, that domestic violence is not only physical violence but also emotional and psychological violence. Many women are fully aware of the degrading way in which emotional violence works. How can the Prime Minister profess to show concern for women victims in these situations yet condone videos which degrade women in an unbelievable way? The women's organisations, particularly the Mothers Union of Australia, have put the matter very well. I would like to reread the following pages:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe it is illogical for the Government to support such projects as `fair go to women' and affirmative action which seek to improve the status of women in the community while allowing the free availability of material which depicts women as mere objects for male sexual gratification. </PARA>
<PARA>I can only say, `How true'. We cannot try to improve the status of women at the same time as allowing our sex to be so degraded. Senator Jenkins in her speech referred to the fact that I had limited the ban or importation of videos to X-rated videos. As I understood her concern, it was that she felt that I had not extended it to the importation of extra violent videos. The X-rated videos are imported. We have been told that none are produced in Australia. They are easily identified. As for the reduction of violence, the type of violence to which I have referred, I believe that the Film Censorship Review Board can deal with that type of video, making its interpretation of the words I suggest, whether the videos are made in Australia or imported. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov in her speech showed what little work she had done on the Bill. I quote from her speech to underline her lack of credibility in this area. She had not even read my Bill. Senator Zakharov said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is notable that Senator Walters's private member's Bill does not address the question of the portrayal of violence yet this is something that is of great concern to the community . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What rubbish! My Bill does two things. It downgrades violence in videos and it bans X-rated videos. Senator Zakharov went on:</PARA>
<PARA>To save the time of the Senate, I have not addressed the details and wording of Senator Walters's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>She did not even address it by reading it. She ignored that part of my Bill and then claimed that it did not exist. So credibility for Senator Zakharov in this debate just does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report was put out following research undertaken by Check and Sommers in the United States of America involving 44 women who suffered severe battering by their male partners. They were compared with a control group of women who had not had any battering-no domestic violence. It was found that the partners of the battered women were high consumers of pornography, in the form of both videos and magazines, while the partners of the control group were not. I foreshadow amendments to my Bill to carry out my original intention to allow:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . depictions of matters of such educational, cultural, scientific, historical or cinematographic significance that is in the public interest for it to be classified. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Bill stands, these exceptions relate only to videos depicting excessive violence. However, I also meant it to apply to X-rated videos. The amendments that I foreshadow read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Page 4, subclause 5 (3), line 23, after ``subsection (2)'', insert: ``and subject to subsection (5)''. </PARA>

It is no use saying that parents would have control over whether they would see them.

<PARA> (1) Page 4, subclause 5 (3), line 27, leave out ``, whether or not the material'', insert ``and''. </PARA>
<PARA>If agreed to this amendment will, of course, dramatically change the tenor of Senator Walters's Bill. It is very important that I draw that matter to the Committee's attention. I state at this point that there are other amendments put forward by Senator Harradine and me which relate-they are relevant to this clause-to the control of video material which in Senator Walters's Bill would be classified under clause 5 (1) (g) on page 4, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>video material is not be to be sold, let on hire or delivered to a person under the age of 18 years other than by a parent or guardian of the person. </PARA>
<PARA>That classification relates, as matters stand, to both R-rated and X-rated videos. This amendment comes right to the crux of what the Committee is debating, that is, whether videos currently classified under an X-classification which show explicit sexual acts involving no suggestions of coercion and no consent of any kind should be able to be viewed by adults in the community. That has been flagged in the second reading stage debate. I am very appreciative of the difference in those second reading remarks. I am very appreciative also of the remarks that Senator Walters made previously in her summing up speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters said quite correctly-I am sure there would be no dissent from her remark-that no-one would want to see or condone matters such as child pornography. Of course, we are all making judgments here. But on some matters there is general agreement. The dissent being expressed in this chamber and the differences of opinion are reflected out in the community. We can look at what is shown on video and on film. Murders are shown but murder is illegal. We do not say that we will ban all videos and films that show murder. Sex between consenting adults is legal and that is what we are now seeking to ban. This matter does not need further consideration. And I want to ask Senator Walters questions with regard to her definition in clause 4 of the Bill of depictions of explicit sexual acts. Perhaps Senator Walters will address that matter latter. I may go back to that at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> Prostitution is illegal in some States; it is certainly illegal in my home State of Western Australia, but it is condoned by the police. We have a system known as `containment', which means that the police decide how many brothels there shall be in Western Australia, who will run them, how often they will be raided, and who will be warned about this so that they will not be charged. I am very glad that it has come to the point where we really discuss these matters because I think that they need discussion. We all know what happened in the Joint Select Committee on Video Material: there was a lot of dissent and there were two reports. I would like to quote briefly from one portion of the report of the Committee because I think it sums up very well the dilemma that we find ourselves in. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Almost all witnesses and submissions addressed this issue on the basis of personal or professional experience, common-sense and intelligent assessment, or on the basis of behavioural science studies. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there was a whole range of tone of submission to the Committee. It is, of course, a very emotional issue in itself because we are talking about human sexuality, which touches all of us very closely. It is a matter which does concern every adult. We are talking about censorship and how far we should go with censorship; we are also talking about people's rights and how far we take people's rights. I hope that when we discuss my amendment all these matters will be brought out properly and thoroughly. I hope that the issues will be canvassed properly before there is any vote on my amendment. </PARA>

For instance, why has she chosen that particular age grouping in clause 5 (1) (d), (e), (f) and (g), knowing that a 15-year-old today is sometimes very difficult to distinguish from an 18-year-old? The difficulties arise in terms of not so much the parents but the video dealers themselves or people who are expected, at some stage, to understand the classification system and particularly understand the logic behind that system. I am not talking about the dealer in the shop. Obviously that is a question further down the line.

I am very strongly against the artistic relationship between pornography and violence. I believe that some of the views Senator Walters has been espousing are appropriate and that we need to do something about this matter. I am asking Senator Walters why she put this age arrangement in the legislation when she simply indicated to me before that she has taken it from the existing standards. The existing standards are not justified philosophically in this Bill. I ask Senator Walters again: is it philosophically and practically justified to have this sort of breakdown of age classifications simply because the current arrangements happen to be that way? Senator Walters said that she put it in because it happens to be what exists at the moment. She is presumably embarking on a new approach to this whole issue, one with which I have a great deal of sympathy. But I am not going to come into this chamber as a senator and listen to Senator Walters say, in respect of a Bill that she had prepared, `There is no basic justification for this; it is here because it is the current arrangement'. The current arrangement in the Australian Capital Territory is not acceptable to me or, I should imagine, to Senator Walters. But she has got to go further than that. Did she pluck the arbitrary ages of 15 and 18 out of the blue simply because they happen to be the existing age classifications, or is there some deeper justification, some practical and philosophical justification, which will encourage me to say, `Yes, I will support not only this particular clause, but the whole Bill.'?</PARA></TALK.START>

If Senator Aulich had bothered to listen he would know that my Bill did two things only, both of which are in line with the unanimous decision of Attorneys-General throughout Australia. I made it very clear that my Bill took up the concerns of the Attorneys-General of all the States in two areas. They expressed concern and the majority of members of our Committee expressed the same concern. The majority of members of our Committee recommended that violence in videos be downgraded and that X-rated videos be abolished. The Attorneys-General from all over Australia said exactly the same thing. If Senator Aulich had been listening to my speech, he would have heard me say that my Bill simply did those two things. He is trying to be smart. If he is very concerned about the present age grouping and the present situation in the Australian Capital Territory, he should put up an amendment and we will see whether we agree with it. I challenge Senator Aulich to be sincere-not to waffle, not to carry on and not to tell me, following the Caucus decision not to support my Bill, that he is concerned about the decision in the Australian Capital Territory.

How can she ask anyone in the community to make a decision about a classification which draws such a fine line between a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having been brought into the chamber, it is legislation belonging to all of us. We all have our entitlements to discuss it. I think Senator Aulich's points suggests that there is a change of philosophy in this legislation from that which has governed the classification of video materials thus far. As I understand it, that is the burden of his particular question to Senator Walters and to the chamber. The answer is to be found in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. The Joint Select Committee indicated, in respect of the classification system, in respect of the establishment of a Film Censorship Board, and in respect of the various classifications of G, PG, M and R, that, for the most part, those particular arrangements were suitable for the balance of the rights of individuals to see and view the material they wished and for the protection of society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, it was agreed that there should be some kind of censorship. The majority found that that philosophy extended to everything except material which was explicitly sexual. That material was exempted from those general classification principles. That is what the majority held. Senator Aulich's question about the classification systems and the age limits to those classification systems does not really come into the question of philosophy, because the Committee considered that those were the appropriate classifications. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill enshrines the guidelines which were put in place at the time by the Film Censorship Board relating to classification M; that is, video material not recommended for viewing by persons under the age of 15. Since then, the Film Censorship Board has changed slightly that particular classification or denomination for M. It now says that the M classification is recommended for mature audiences, 15 years of age and over. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Aulich that it is not for us to recommend that certain material be suitable, or be recommended, for audiences 15 years or over. Are all persons of 15 years of age mature? This new classification, or identification, just recently introduced by the Film Censorship Board without our say so and without our having brought it before the Committee, is rather disconcerting. It is only a minor point, but I think it is desirable to stick with the wording which existed previously. There is no change in philosophy. There is an acceptance of the need for a Film Censorship Board to balance the competing demands of citizens in respect of this very major question. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing this Bill attempts is to require censorship to be applied to material for which censorship is not now currently applied. It comes down to the question of a policy which has been developed over a considerable period. That policy was developed from the days of the late Lionel Murphy and was at last introduced into this Parliament by way of regulation in 1984. That policy, in effect, did not require the tests which would be required for other types of material to be applied to this type of material. Persons can import any material relating to sex, provided it is not physically violent. That could include, and does include, material which promotes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, high-risk behaviour, group sex, anal sex and the like. Anybody can bring the material in and, provided nobody actually twists somebody's arm, the material is automatically registered. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee believed that that should not be the case and strongly opposed the view expressed by the minority of the Committee that there should be a new non-violent erotica proposal, because that proposal would entrench X-rated hard-core pornography into the community and into the home video entertainment system. It is important for everybody to understand what we are talking about. We are talking about the home video entertainment system. The Government is entrenching that material in that system. We have the opportunity today, by voting for Senator Walters's Bill, to take that material out of the home video entertainment market and refuse its importation into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins's proposal guts Senator Walters's Bill. It would enable X-rated video materials to be introduced and brought into this country. Providing there is no physical twisting of arms-there is a lot of psychological twisting of arms-anything goes. That question must be determined by this chamber today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a question about some of the other subclauses of clause 5, but I would like first to come in on the question of children's ages. I do not know whether I have written it down correctly, but I understood Senator Walters to say in her second reading summing up that children now have this material freely available. I do not know whether she was talking about children over 15 or about those under 15. I suspect she was talking about the latter. Senator Aulich referred to the great difficulty that retailers, in particular, have in knowing how old children are. When I was teaching I would often see children at places such as hotels who to me were clearly under age, but people who are not used to that age group find it very hard to tell, particularly when some of the young people are made up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure Senator Walters remembers the case of Mrs Cains, who actually set up one of her children and tried to set up another one in order to pass them off as older to entrap a retailer. It is rather inconsistent to uphold Senator Walters's classifications. It seems that if Senator Walters wants to be consistent she should say that nothing should be available over the present classification of `G', which, I think, is `D' in her classification; in other words, video material suitable for all ages. Otherwise we will have the problem of video retailers, the people responsible, not necessarily deliberately breaking the law, but doing so because children frequently pass themselves off as older than they are, even without the assistance of their mothers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am addressing subclause 4 of clause 5, which is totally in order. As I started to say, Senator Walters had a go at me for what I said in my speech on the second reading. I should have been more careful in what I said. I do not have a copy of my speech here, but according to Senator Walters-I have no reason to doubt her-I said that she did not address the portrayal of violence. I should have spelt it out more clearly, but I meant that her Bill did not address the portrayal of violence any more effectively than does the present legislation; in other words, the clause adds nothing to the present situation. The clause has no force as something new. A lot of what is in the Bill is not really new. It echoes what has gone before. I will read out what is presently banned. `Violence' covers detailed and gratuitous depictions of acts of considerable violence or cruelty and explicit or gratuitous depictions of sexual violence against non-consenting persons. The only word added to that in Senator Walters's subclause is `relished'. In the Joint Select Committee on Video Material there was a great deal of discussion about use of the words `relished' and `gratuitous'. My view is that both of them are in the eye of the observer. I have problems with material being described as `gratuitous' because anyone can construct a video so as to justify something as not being gratuitous; someone can write a story so that a particular action is not gratuitous and get around that. The question of the word `relished' is to my mind a purely subjective one. It adds nothing to say `relished'. What `relished' means to me I am sure is not what it means to Senator Walters. What I consider to be meant by `relished' may not be seen in the same way by anybody else in the chamber. Similarly, what Senator Walters regards as the meaning of `relished' may not be so regarded by anybody else in this chamber. It is a matter of taste, and we cannot legislate for taste except in a very broad fashion. I ask Senator Walters in what way she feels that this subclause in her Bill adds to the provision which is already in the legislation. I say this in the context of knowing that the community in general-that would include at least some of the Attorneys-General, as shown by their remarks made at and after their meetings-does not understand the present situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Senator will be patient, I will tell him. There is widespread confusion, not only among the Attorneys but also in the community at large, about what is M, PG, G, R, and X. Senator Walters has quoted, in the committee stage of this debate, a ream of women's bodies throughout Australia that object to X-rated material. It is something like the answers in an opinion poll. It is necessary to look at the questions that have been asked. I have no doubt that, because of the connections he has, Senator Harradine will respond to this. It is a matter of fact that a number of major organisations in Australia representing very large groups of women, such as the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDAEA) and the Federated Clerks Union, lodged similar objections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Harradine knows-and I invite him to address this matter-the national secretary of the SDAEA, in respect of the classifications that clause 5 is changing, made a number of public statements about his abhorrence and the abhorrence of his members to X-rated videos. As I am sure Senator Harradine knows full well, the national secretary went on to say that his members were outraged by the continuing display and sale of gratuitous sexual violence in X-rated material.

He exhibited the total confusion about classifications that is being espoused this afternoon in the debate by Senator Walters. Since 1984, X-rated material has contained no explicit violence. That has been totally banned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the confusion in the community at large on this issue, I refer to an editorial. Senator Harradine knows that I could produce another half a dozen similar editorial comments. About the time that the secretary of the SDAEA was demonstrating his total confusion about what it was he wanted to ban-if that is not relevant to this debate I do not know what is-an editorial in the West Australian newspaper responded to a foreshadowed move by the Western Australian Government to make the possession of X-rated material a criminal offence under the laws of Western Australia. The members of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material will be able to attest to the fact that I alone among the Labor members of that Committee-in fact, I suffered some friction because of it-moved to reserve the right for State governments to set their own standards on this matter. I have to plead guilty to that. It is my background. Coming from the Northern Territory, I am a little more sensitive than others to the total devolution of democratic rights to a Canberra government. Senator Zakharov can correct me if I am wrong, but I think I am correct in saying that I did stand out for the rights of Western Australia. This is reflected in the recommendations. There is a recommendation in the majority report, which I inserted on my motion, to allow the States to continue to exercise their own jurisdiction in these areas. As much as I might have objected to what the Western Australian Government did with that law-I thought it was a pointless exercise-I respected its right to do it. It was entitled to be answerable to the people of Western Australia in the same way as the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory are entitled to respond to laws passed by the new Government of the Australian Capital Territory. This was very much reflected in the recommendations, as Senator Walters should know, of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, which was headed by Mr Meese and which inquired into X-rated pornographic material in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this confusion exists. The West Australian editorial to which I referred said that although it had reservations about such draconian legislation making possession a serious offence, it would be a relief to see child pornography and bestiality taken off the shelves of Western Australian video shops. That was the leader in the major newspaper in Western Australia. No doubt it was written by someone who saw himself as a moulder of public opinion. That type of journalism really annoys me. I rarely get annoyed about journalism because one of the great bastions of democratic society is the freedom of the press. I do get annoyed when journalists, particularly if they are editorial writers, do not do their homework. But that confusion exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is in fact no bestiality, no child pornography and no violence in X-rated material. Interestingly enough, X-rated material is the only category that contains no violence of any description. Even G-rated videos contain violence and are allowed to contain violence. X explicitly contains no violence at all. This confusion is not a perceived confusion. It is real and exists at the highest levels of journalism, public opinion and political opinion, and it is about time the confusion was resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> John Dickie, the censor, would tell the honourable senator that the difficulty is, and the honourable senator knows it, that the more words such as `relished' which are inserted-which is what Senator Walters wants and which is what Senator Zakharov covered very well-to try to define the job for the censors, the more difficult their job becomes. It is a difficult enough job now because, as the honourable senator knows, it becomes more and more subjective the more descriptions are put in. The simpler the classifications the easier it is for the censors to do what is, in fact, an extremely difficult job. In closing I ask Senator Walters to explain what her interpretation of `relished' is. </PARA>

Yet they have both asked, `What is this word ``relished''?'. Senator Collins went even further and said that Mr Dickie said that the more words that were put in the more confused it became.

<PARA> Let us return to Senator Jenkins, who at least is being honest about this. Senator Jenkins's amendment does absolutely nothing except bring back X-rated videos. All it does is say that X-rated videos ought to be allowed in. She acknowledged that it makes large alterations to my Bill, and she is quite right because it allows for X-rated videos. Senator Jenkins said that she does not see why the depiction of sexual acts between consenting adults should be made illegal viewing in the home when the viewing of videos depicting murder, which is illegal, is allowed in the home. The way Senator Jenkins talks anybody would think these videos are just love stories. Senator Jenkins is wrong to put that impression across. It is incorrect. It is deceiving. They are not love stories. Such videos do not depict a love scene between adults. That is the worst sort of nonsense that one can imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Senator Jenkins whether she is serious in saying that films which the Film Censorship Board believes are too bad to be shown in the cinemas around this country, except to those over 18, are all right for home entertainment. Does Senator Jenkins really believe that she can pretend to the community that they are merely love stories-sex between consenting adults? I can assure her they are far from that. They are not just blue movies. They are degrading to women. Even Robbie Swan, the man who is really pushing X-rated videos and who is the X-rated video lobbyist, says that between 20 and 30 per cent of them are degrading to women. He is the man whom this Government is supporting-the spokesman for the multi-million dollar adult video lobby. That is who Senator Bob Collins is supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> But Robbie Swan himself says that between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of these X-rated videos are degrading to women. Well, it is not just 20 per cent to 30 per cent-it is 100 per cent. They are degrading to women. Of course, Senator Collins, who is a man, would not understand that and I do not expect him to understand it. But let me explain to Senator Collins that, while he is a man and does not understand that attitude, all the women out there in Australia do, because all the women's organisations-every single one of them-have written to us and expressed their concern.

When I am on the question of definition, I am more interested in clause 5 (5), which says that an exception can be made on the basis of `educational, cultural, scientific, historical and cinematographic significance'. I really wonder what this refers to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not moved from its position. It believes that this can best be done by way of regulation. The Copyright Tribunal, after all, is a most expert body. It has the capacity to set rates and to take relevant information into account, probably by doing sampling surveys of the institutions concerned, which vary as to the external studies programs which they offer to students who undertake courses from a point so far removed from the campus concerned that they cannot be given normal class room tutorial assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The idea was that that Tribunal, with that expertise and carrying out those surveys, would be able to take into account a rate for external students that would enable it to discount the royalty rate payable by institutions to the extent that the copying could be described as an equivalent to fair copying. Some assessment of that has to take place to prevent any abuse of the copying, which would be the case if there were an outright exemption. Accordingly, we believe that institutions such as those that have a large external studies program will pay no more for copying for external students than they probably do at present when it is all boiled down. The fact is that this will be in the hands of the Tribunal concerned rather than the Parliament attempting to do it by some waving of the wand. In short, we still believe that our system remains the best of the three alternatives that have been put before the chamber. </PARA>

For the reasons that we expressed earlier, neither of us is particularly convinced by the argument the Minister has just put concerning this regulatory procedure.

<PARA> I am unsure of the Government's attitude on amendment 16. As we made clear in our speeches during the second reading debate, we believe that the prescribed organisations should be defined within the legislation and that there should be the capacity for additional organisations to be added to the list. These bodies have an important responsibility. They are to be exempted from an obligation in regard to payment. As I understand it, the bodies that we have listed in amendment 16 are the types of bodies which the Government was of a mind to include within its regulatory mechanism. They include educational institutions assisting handicapped readers, institutions assisting intellectually handicapped people, institutions assisting the blind or the visually impaired, institutions assisting the deaf or the hearing impaired, organisations engaged in broadcasting and organisations engaged in the production of sound recordings. If we are correct in believing that there would be no objection in the Committee to these groups being at least some of those which will ultimately be exempted, we can see no argument why they should not be set out in this legislation. This would give Parliament the opportunity to vote upon them, and in this instance to vote for their specific reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the proposition contained in amendment 17. In regard to amendment 16, I am still unaware of what the Government intends by way of `prescribed organisation'. In other words, does the Government seek to prescribe a specific and named organisation, or does it intend by way of regulation to have a more general classification? There is a difficulty in Senator Hill's proposition. Having said what a prescribed organisation means-for example, an institution assisting handicapped readers in paragraph (b)-we are then not much clearer whether that particular institution, whatever it is, is of the nature of an institution assisting handicapped readers as set out under the Act. I wonder whether the Minister would explain the intent in prescribing by regulation a centre that goes by a specific name-for example, the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland. Would it be named as one of those prescribed organisations, or would it merely be lumped under a regulation which said that all institutions assisting intellectually handicapped persons or whatever else would be exempt?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the whole, while the sorts of categories which Senator Hill has indicated might qualify as a prescribed organisation are in the correct area, it is the Government's intention in many instances to list the organisations which are actually within that category. This is to try to prevent abuse. The definition in amendment 16 of `an organisation engaged in broadcasting' is very broad. One would not want persons to take advantage of that category. We want any listing to be as precise as possible. I am not saying that in some instances a description by category would not be sufficient. There may be many instances where one would want to list the actual organisations concerned, and that is the Government's intention.</PARA></TALK.START>

Perhaps when clause 13 comes back for discussion, the Minister might take that initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to Opposition amendment 17, which I understand the Government is prepared to accept-and I thank the Minister for his assistance in that matter-the whole question of the levy on blank tapes has a long history which I had the opportunity to recount in my speech during the second reading debate. I pay tribute to the way in which the Australian Record Industry Association over many years has pursued with real vigour and vigilance the introduction of a blank tape levy. This matter goes back to November 1983, having been accepted in principle by the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans. I believe that the proper diversion of money which will occur from the levy on these blank tapes will be used in a very proper fashion to support the operations of contemporary music and to support the work which is being undertaken with the support of State governments and the Commonwealth government to promote the contemporary music industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As you know, recent announcements have been made by the State Government of Victoria regarding the establishment in support of the Victorian Rock Foundation. Recently, at the annual Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) awards, Mr Peter Collins, the Minister for Arts in New South Wales, made an announcement about support which that Liberal State government was going to give to export promotional activities for popular music originating in that State. ARIA is to be congratulated and, in particular, its excellent current Executive Director, Mr David Watts, is to be congratulated on the contribution which he has made to the development of this copyright legislation, both in terms of following up earlier representations on the question of blank tape levies and also in relation to questions of performer's rights, to which we will come shortly. The only question I have to ask the Minister is whether the Government has any estimate of what it believes that levy is likely to be and the revenue that is likely to be raised as a result of the levy. I would simply like some indication if the Minister can provide that. </PARA>

With that point made, we are pleased that the Government has seen the light on this argument after arguing, in fact, to the contrary for so long prior to and during the debate in the other place. In the other place, the whole debate was curtailed. Outside the chamber, the Government vigorously defended its former position.

<PARA> Page 47, clause 26, proposed subsection 248a (1), proposed definition of `exempt recording', paragraph (f), lines 39 to 42 leave out the paragraph (f), insert the following new paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(f) a direct or indirect sound recording or cinematograph film of a performance made:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) for the purpose of, or associated with, the reporting of news or current affairs; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) for the purpose of criticism or review;''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to one of the definitions of exempt recording from the new performer's protection provisions which are to be inserted as part 11a of the legislation. As the provision stands in the Government's Bill-I refer to paragraph (f)-an `exempt recording' means:</PARA>
<PARA> A direct or indirect sound recording or cinematograph film of a short extract of a performance made solely for the purpose of reporting news by means of broadcasting or in cinematograph film, or for the purpose of criticism or review;</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme of that provision is clear. There is to be an exemption for direct or indirect recordings of news matters. It has been put by the industry that the definition of news might be too narrow for what we presume all parties are seeking to achieve. I understand that news can be defined in a particularly limited form, whereas we would have presumed that surrounding type information or information that might be communicated through what is commonly referred to as current affairs programs should be equally exempt. I think that is a good argument. I hope that that sigh is because the Minister is tired and it is not because he does not accept the argument. We have therefore brought forward this amendment which is to replace the wording of paragraph (f), which I have just read, with new wording which would provide that an exempt recording will be a direct or indirect sound recording or cinematograph film of a performance made for the purpose of, or associated with, the reporting of news or current affairs or for the purpose of criticism or review. In other words, I believe that what we are putting is in accordance with the scheme that the Government has promoted. It is slightly broadening the definition we think in a way that is constructive and will, therefore, better enable material to be communicated through current affairs programs without the risk of an action under the new performers protection provisions. I do not think I need to say any more on that. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment. The exemption, speaking about reporting news in our proposal, is deliberately narrow. The idea is not to try to undermine the rights of performers to get reasonable remuneration for the use made of a performance or a recording of a performance by those who themselves are in the business of generating income-those operating a commercial television station, for example. They would certainly gather taxpayer support by getting good ratings if it is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or the Special Broadcasting Service. The fact is that an exemption in favour of news reporting is justified because of the time pressures which go into the compiling of a news segment on television, radio news, or whatever it might be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Current affairs programs do not really suffer quite the same pressure and in fact some, as we know, are compiled over many months. I know that there are some that just fall in between, but the fact is that I think a fair distinction can be drawn between those situations where it would be quite impossible and impracticable to get the permission of copyright owners. The pressure of the news broadcasts is quite different from the sorts of pressures that apply in relation to current affairs programs. I believe that if recorded performances are to be used in the current affairs program, then they ought not to be exempted from the provisions of the Bill. The Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers speaks of the use of short excerpts in connection with reporting of current events. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true; nevertheless, short excerpts in connection with the reporting of current events. Within the Australian context, what that more clearly equates to is the use of a smaller segment of a performance in relation to a news item rather than the more lengthy, or even short for that matter, use of a performance in a current affairs program, whereas as I say there ought to be time for those compiling the program to obtain the permission of the copyright owner or of the performer concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Australian Democrats will support Senator Hill's amendment. Indeed, in the amendments which I circulated previously there was to have been a third amendment, but because of the new technologies we are talking about it went off into some electronic limbo and actually did not appear on the paper from the printer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the point that the Minister for Justice raises is somewhat at odds with what I understood the actual purpose to be. Indeed, it does not seem to me to be terribly important whether the time pressure is there or not in terms of broadcasting. In other words, we exempt news because we cannot get round in time to get the copyright out of the people. I would have thought rather that we exempt news because, by its very nature, it is reporting something that is not, as it were, paid performance and only peripherally does one find the people there; for example, something may have happened to the performers. The news is not actually reporting the performance in as much as an accident or some other event that took place. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister is correct in saying that there is a distinction with current affairs. In the Australian context, current affairs has slightly blurred edges. By and large current affairs snippets are not all that much longer than the news snippets. I do not know whether the Minister, who is a polished performer, is able to insert the history of the Western world into some of the small segments that one manages to get on current affairs, but they are incredibly short. On the other hand, very often current affairs do cover matters that are not covered by the news; for example, current affairs may often cover an upcoming cultural event such as a new ballet or something like that. I think that that is a bit rough. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that current affairs are covering the ballet is for advertising purposes. If the owner of the copyright and the performers are willing to engage in that activity, then it would appear there. News tends to be taken without too many people asking what is going on; current affairs are a slightly more leisurely exercise, as the Minister has indicated, but again taken with permission, particularly those items covering the cultural events where one is likely to find performers. On balance, the argument must be that the news falls under the exempt exercise in terms of a film or performance. I believe that it would otherwise be too much of a stricture particularly because an attempt at the definition of `news' has not been undertaken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have a run at the definition of news. I realise why the Minister's advisers decided not to have a run at it either. In the Australian context we have an informal definition of news which seems to suggest that such service which is provided during the news half-hour segment or hour segment-the extra half-hour which has slightly longer items is called current affairs-is such a woolly exercise that I really do believe it would be far better to adopt what I understand to be the international agreement; that is, short exposure of current events. That normally is our definition of current affairs; it is not our definition of news. If one really wants to define news, it is basically about the latest car smash. The news in the morning is about the car smashes of yesterday. I think that current affairs tend to be much closer to that international definition, that is, short exposures of current events. I do not think we are running foul of the international agreement. I had a feeling during the Minister's comments which suggested that this amendment might, but I do not believe it is. If the Minister has a stronger argument I would certainly like to hear it, but it does seem to me not to violate that international agreement. I would have thought that Senator Hill's amendment will allow what we normally call news and current affairs. It is interesting that we have that terminology in Australia. We hold them very close together and we see them to be of the same type. I believe that this would not run into those areas where there is an extended performance being screened. I think that that would certainly violate performers' rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition amendment No. 18 to clause 26 relates to the definition of the term `news broadcast' or to the exclusions which relate to news and current events broadcasting for the purposes of obtaining consents and permissions for broadcasts. The issue which has been raised is the narrow wording in clause 26, section 248a (1) (f). The wording is sufficiently narrow that it would exclude programs dealing with events which are not necessarily new or contemporaneous but are nevertheless of current interest. The example given is of the Channel 9 program, Sunday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has already been pointed out, article XVb of the Rome Convention refers to current events, rather than to the narrow term `news'. Perhaps attention should be drawn specifically to what may be an inconsistency in the Government's approach to this matter. A little further on, section 248 (a) (2) on page 49 provides for exemptions relating to the recitation or delivery of an item of news or information. I quote specifically sub-clause 2, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>a performance referred to in subsection 28 (1), or a reading, recitation or delivery of an item of news or information, or the performance of a sporting activity, shall be taken not be performances for the purposes of the Part. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has put the point of view, in the speech which Senator Hill made before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, that the narrow definition of the term `news' in clause 26, rather than reflecting the broader definition which is used in the Rome Convention of `current events', would have the deleterious consequences of which he spoke, namely that it would make it that much more difficult for current affairs programs to be broadcast in a more easy and expeditious fashion. The amendment now before the Committee will have the effect of widening that particular scope and definition so as to avoid the problems to which Senator Hill, Senator Macklin and I have been drawing attention. </PARA>

Looking at what the Minister is setting up for it, the industry has suddenly realised that he is giving it an impossible task, or is certainly telling it that it can only release such recordings at its jeopardy and in circumstances where, in practical terms, it is simply unable to obtain the consent of those who become part of the performance which is recorded. The Minister says, `That is a bit extreme' but I am sure that after hearing that explanation he will agree that the matter does require some remedial action. I am sure he will appreciate that a small amendment of this nature relating to participation in a performance by a member of an audience not being taken to be a performance is a sensible way to resolve this problem.

Rather than simply focusing on the global aspect which perhaps the Minister has been concerned with, I wish to draw attention to the submission, not only of the Australian Record Industry Association Ltd, but also of the Federation of Australian and Commercial Television Stations (FACTS). In its submission to the Opposition on this matter it made the point that in 1983 it had made a submission to the Copyright Law Review Committee on performers' protection, drawing attention to the difficulties in application of authorisation requirements to parades or events which actually require audience participation. It cited two particular examples, both drawn from Sydney: the Carols by Candlelight celebration and the Gay Mardi Gras Parade.

That is clearly a performance. It may well have been specifically created, rehearsed, written and performed for that particular event.

She is probably thinking that they went together in some way. The point raised by Senator Hill and Senator Puplick seems to us to be a very sensible one. I do not think the Government intended to cover those people who would appear accidentally, by way of being dragged willingly or unwillingly from the audience, to participate in a performance that is being broadcast, or, as Senator Puplick said, who engage in some activity that would be performed, rehearsed and the like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite a number of such performances are regularly televised. It is clearly impossible for a member of the audience who may be participating in a particular function to be identified or contacted. It does not seem to be sensible to make a law which is simply unenforceable. The amendment moved by Senator Hill is a sensible one. I am not sure why it seems extreme, but if it is it is an extreme position that one should definitely take. I am at somewhat of a loss as to why such a provision was not originally included in the legislation, particularly in view of the enormous difficulties that could arise in such contexts. </PARA>
<PARA> To add weight to that point, it is interesting that the Government itself sought to exclude a performance of a sporting activity. Most televised sporting activities are engaged in by professionals who could very well have a far greater interest in this matter than those people who, as members of an audience, participate in a performance. However, the Government has excluded performance of a sporting activity. I presume that it is excluding sporting activities and not a performance of a sporting activity. But if there is a difference, I would be interested to know what it is.

As honourable senators would know if they look at page 48 of the Bill, the definition of `performance' already tries to draw a distinction between performers and the audience. The definition `performance' is set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) `being a live performance given in Australia by one or more qualified persons, whether in the presence of an audience or otherwise'. By that, one is indicating that the definition of `performance' offered there presupposes a distinction between performers and audience. Senator Hill's amendment seems to my mind to be somewhat ambiguous and difficult in its reference to `a participation in a performance as a member of an audience'.

I had assumed we were talking about sporting activities, but there is no reason for such a provision to be included in the legislation because sporting activities are, by definition, already excluded. Therefore, it is something else. I am now more concerned that a performance of a sporting activity could cover an activity such as Senator Puplick's good example of wrestling. Fairly obviously, that is a dramatic activity. It has nothing very much to do with wrestling, but an awful lot to do with earning a lot of money. Those people who engage in rock and roll wrestling have a good deal of money invested in being professionals in that particular-I am not sure what it is-activity, and I am sure would not be at all happy that those activities being televised would be excluded from their being able to assert rights over those performances.</PARA></TALK.START>

There must be some forms of wrestling which, I agree, border on the entertainment rather than any exhibition of sporting prowess such as graced the gymnasiums in ancient Greece, or perhaps not. The performance of sporting activity is a comprehensive term obviously trying to embrace the idea of a sporting activity being available for others to enjoy; it normally presupposes an audience or those who can take pleasure from seeing the drama of the contest unfold. That is why the term `performance' is used rather than `sporting activity' simpliciter. It is meant to embrace or carry that idea that the sporting activity itself is available for spectators or an audience to enjoy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment No. 20 refers to retrospectivity, which the Government itself embraced earlier in the evening so its is not my intention to proceed with it. I move to amendment No. 21, which is a small amendment but one that is important to the particular industry concerned. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (21) Page 51, clause 26, proposed paragraph 248g (2) (c), line 37, after ``for the purposes of use in'', leave out ``a'', insert ``that or any other''.</PARA>
<PARA>The argument on this matter is that this clause describes one of the many acts constituting an unauthorised use of a performance. This particular one is the copying of an unauthorised recording for a purpose other than its use in a soundtrack. It has been put to us, and we accept it, that there is an argument that it would prevent the use of the recording for a later soundtrack, for example the use of a song in a later television commercial. We considered it and we had some reservations but, if there are those who regard it as being ambiguous, we believe that it is better to take this opportunity to clarify the drafting and put the matter beyond doubt. Therefore we seek to do so by means of this amendment which, in effect, inserts the words, `that or any other soundtrack.'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not see that this amendment is necessary. I do not say that it will be the end of the world if it is passed. The fact is that the Advertising Federation of Australia has expressed its concerns and obviously these have found some sympathetic hearing within the Opposition ranks. The concern was that there would be an unauthorised use when the sound recording was not authorised for use in each particular soundtrack. The Government still believes that this is not a very plausible reading of the provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clear meaning is that a performer exercises his so-called synchronisation right once only in relation to the first use of his recording on a soundtrack; that is, his consent is required only if he has not given it for use in any soundtrack at all. Once consent has been given to use in a soundtrack it is effective for use in any soundtrack. That is the advice that is available to me on a reasonable reading and construction of that provision. In those circumstances the Opposition amendment is thought to be unnecessary and the Government does not support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise again to the Committee for the lateness of the revised edition of my proposed amendment. The way that we have had to put these amendments together means that we have run into the same problem that Senator Hill had with the first set of amendments, which is that amendments to the same clause end up dealing with two of the matters which we have already discussed in part. That concerns the exercise regarding external students. It appears in my amendments at page 2 and reads: A fair dealing with literary work (other than lecture notes) does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work if it is for the purpose of, or associated with, an approved course of study or research by an enrolled external student of an educational institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to mislead the Committee. This is in far narrower terms than that proposed originally by the Opposition. It is tightly worded but, we believe, strikes a reasonable balance between the demands, rights and requirements of the authors of the work and enables those people who are in an approved course of study and are enrolled external students to be able to make use, through the mechanism of asking somebody to make their copies for them, of fair dealing for this purpose. It does not give everything that the institutions originally wanted but, again, does strike that balance. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek the guidance of the Chair as to how the Committee wishes to deal with this stage of my amendments. I could move both amendments and we could discuss parts of them, because we have discussed some of them already. I propose to move Nos. 1 and 2 together, because the only other item with which they deal is media monitoring. This has meant that it appears in two sections. The first part appears in the first amendment, dealing with literary works, and the second part is in the second amendment dealing with, essentially, recordings. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as media monitoring is concerned, we have again sought a balance. It certainly does not provide everything that everybody sought but it is, essentially, a statutory licence mechanism which would mean that those people who wished to engage commercially in the monitoring of media would be able to enter into an agreement with the owner of that copyright; and, if such an agreement was unable to be reached, one could be achieved by use of the mechanism of the Copyright Tribunal. The other requirement, after the agreement for the payment had been determined by either of those two methods, would be that sufficient acknowledgment of the work would be made. This is not an onerous exercise because the correct designation of where a work comes from and where it was broadcast is an essential element within the business of monitoring the media anyhow. Hence, a sufficient acknowledgment is already made in all the media monitoring activities that take place in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts 3 and 4 come in because it may be, and often is, the case that the owner of the copyright to a work-and this is much more likely to be the case, I am informed, in the electronic media-finds a use for the monitoring services themselves. In the press world, it is well known that the monitoring of newspapers is a very well-developed industry in this country, and many media organisations themselves actually own the companies which provide those types of services. The monitoring of the electronic media is a relatively new field in Australia but probably, I suggest, adds weight to the reason why we should seek to provide a regime under which it can operate fairly and reasonably. </PARA>
<PARA> Newspapers are a continuing source of information; so a newspaper published today can be readily available to almost every citizen over a reasonable period throughout the rest of this year. Hence if one's attention is drawn to a particular article in a newspaper, there is no difficulty in getting a copy of it. By the ephemeral nature of broadcasting, when one's attention is drawn to a program, one does not normally have access to it. But I would remind senators in this place that they, in fact, do have access to broadcasts. They can find a copy of a news item or a current affairs item in our own library in this building. I am sure that every senator in this place has availed himself or herself of that monitoring facility carried out by our own library. I find it a bit odd that we should condone the exercise within our own premises, yet not seek to regularise it in the wider world. </PARA>
<PARA> Many citizens seek this facility. I will give the Minister an example which probably he will find interesting, both ideologically and factually. The Queensland Teachers Union, in my own State, has been running a very long and rigorous campaign with regard to class sizes. The union has a contract with an electronic monitoring service to provide it with instances when the issue of class sizes is debated, whether or not the Queensland Teachers Union is linked to such debate. In other words, if the Minister is broadcast on radio and makes claims about class sizes, the Queensland Teachers Union wants to know as part of its ongoing campaign to try to get the Government to lower the high numbers in many classes. That seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable means to use. After all, people who speak on radio or television, which are broadcast to everybody, cannot have any objection to the fact that what they say may be repeated. They have said it to everybody to start off with, and I fail to see why sensitivity should exist to their remarks being repeated. I find the Opposition's amendment far too broad. It does not recognise the countervailing pressure, which is that the owners of the copyright still own it and that one should not, as it were, be allowed with impunity, to copy, and make money out of, somebody else's property. </PARA>
<PARA> Seeking a balance-having freedom of information and the provision of information generally in the community, while trying to retain proper notions of copyright and ownership-led us to the notion, which, of course, is already partly embedded in other areas within these amendments, of a statutory licence. I know that it does not meet the position that the Opposition is mounting and that it does not meet the Government's position. However, I hope that it might be seen as an attempted rational and reasonable compromise, given the fact that the industries do exist-I refer to the electronic area and the press area-that they should exist because they offer a service, and that, indeed, the points that I have made are not made simply by me. I draw the Minister's attention to a speech made by the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, in March 1987. It is entitled `Keeping up with Copyright'. Amongst other things regarding this matter, the Attorney-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> I can give you one example from my own personal experience. Like most people in public life, I need to know what other people are saying about me and about the policies I am responsible for. As well as the ideas and opinions, I need to know the words used and the context of the comment. And I want to know quickly, while an issue is current. </PARA>
<PARA> If someone is able to monitor the media for me, at a reasonable price, they're providing a service which no broadcaster, for example, currently wants to provide. Yet, I understand, there is concern by some that these services breach copyright because they cannot obtain licences from relevant copyright owners. </PARA>
<PARA> The owners' reticence is hard to understand, particularly as it seems the services are used by broadcasting stations to monitor one another. I urge copyright owners to look hard at the private licensing route. If this is not feasible, a simple, narrowly drafted, free exemption for monitoring may be necessary, or a statutory licence. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill, which the Attorney-General brought in, the Government failed to go either of those ways. The Opposition, I think, has sought to take the route of free exemption for monitoring, while we have sought to go by the route of a statutory licence. Whichever method is chosen, some method should be chosen. I believe that if the statutory licence is not available, the words of the Attorney make it sufficiently clear that the Opposition's amendment, which goes the way of the `narrowly drafted free exemption for monitoring' unfortunately will be the only other avenue. I do not think that it is the best. I believe that the statutory licence is the moderate form, and it probably meets the objections of most of the people in the area, while not necessarily satisfying everybody. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is a lot more to be said, except that we believe that there has been confusion in the argument-although I do not say that there has been confusion from the lips of Senator Macklin on this occasion. There is no question of the refusal by copyright owners to acknowledge the part played by media monitors in distributing further particular material so that the public, or a particular organisation such as the Queensland Teachers Union, can become aware of matters of interest and concern to them that have been reported, whether in print, or in some form of the electronic media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin spoke about ideology a moment ago. I believe that this matter should be left to the consultations, the negotiations-tortuous though they are-between copyright owners and media monitors which, at this moment, are being determined partly by an attempt to come to a voluntary licensing arrangement between them. It is something which they can work out. After all, I think it is worth recalling that we are talking about business enterprises. Senator Macklin said, for example, that the Queensland Teachers Union enters into a contract with the media monitors and pays them a sum of money for the performance of a monitoring service. As I see it, there is no reason why the contract could not include a sum of money-obviously the media monitor would make sure that it is passed on to the consumer; in this case, the Queensland Teachers Union-to be paid to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Reuters, Channel 9, or whoever it is who provides the original news item broadcast on television, radio, or whatever it may be. It seems to me that something could be worked out. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, at the moment quite protracted legal proceedings are being engaged in. Between those legal proceedings and the sort of pressure which is being brought to bear, a voluntary arrangement would be far better than a statutory one. In other words, if one is speaking ideologically-and this is what surprises me about Senator Hill's and the Opposition's stance in this matter-I would have thought that in this case, where one is dealing with arrangements which ought to be in place between business enterprises, it would be best to leave them to try to work it out in terms of the law of contract and a voluntary arrangement rather than imposing on them a statutory regime. For that reason the Government remains opposed to this proposal. </PARA>

I am giving an example as one parliamentarian. I guess that I am somewhat privileged because, as a parliamentarian, I am excluded from the provisions of the Act in any event. There is already an exclusion for the type of work that we do. Obviously, a myriad of people in various industries wish to have the information that is published in newspapers-and I am dealing only with newspapers at the moment. A similar argument applies in relation to electronic information which, in many ways, is a more important argument because unless it is copied at that time it tends to be lost forever. People see benefit in engaging someone to take information from existing published material and communicate that information to the client.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Tate in his example was referring to someone who copies that information but, as Senator Tate would know, some of these services simply cut out the relevant parts from already purchased newspapers. It seems that this argument is not as simple as that which Senator Tate is attempting to communicate. I see that there are arguments on both sides. In balancing these arguments we thought there was greater benefit in getting the broadest possible communication of information in the most specified form. It seems to us that this can only be of benefit to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> We were going to move-and I have now had incorporated in Hansard-our two proposed amendments, the first of which deals with the question of monitoring news or other broadcast material and the second of which deals with the copying of a cutting or other extract from a newspaper, magazine or journal. The Australian Democrats have gone down a different path. One of the amendments that they moved set up a form of licence. I see some immediate difficulties, and I regret that I am having to take this on the run. The first of the Democrats' amendments deals with the printed word. The amendment states that the person making the copy has to pay to the owner of the copyright in such work such amount as they agree. Presuming that the law, when it is finally settled, is that the ownership of the property remains with the journalist, that seems to me to indicate that there would have to be an agreement between the monitoring company and each and every journalist. As part of the objective of these monitoring schemes is to get the information quickly to the party that can make use of it, I am somewhat concerned that what is being set up is an impossible barrier. That is one concern that immediately comes to me when I look for the first time at this amendment. I regret that I have not had an opportunity to study in any detail the language used in Senator Macklin's amendment in relation to copying of electronic media information. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to confer with Senator Macklin and with a couple of my colleagues on this matter. Would the Minister be prepared to facilitate that? I shall require only a few minutes. In the meantime, although it is jumping the order, the Committee might be prepared to deal with the amendment that the Minister agreed with Senator Puplick earlier in the day and which no doubt he can now handle. It provides for the tabling of an annual report by one of the associations and is an amendment to clause 13, on page 29 of the Bill. That would give me a couple of minutes to seek some advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The suggestion I was making was that in proposed new section 135zzd an amendment be moved to insert a new subsection (7) which would be parallel to the amendment which the Minister for Justice accepted to clause 135r. This was to provide that the collecting society which is referred to in this proposed new section should prepare an annual report as it is required to do under the other provisions of 135zzd and that that annual report should be presented to the Parliament through the Attorney-General in the same way as we have already established in 135r and in 135zzw. The Minister has agreed to incorporate in 135r, the form of words used in 135zzw. Therefore I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 28, clause 13, after proposed subsection 13522d (1), insert the following new subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(1a) The Attorney-General shall cause a copy of the report sent to the Attorney-General under subsection (1) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the receipt of the report by the Attorney-General.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it the Minister has no objection in principle to ensuring that these annual reports are presented to Parliament. We will have three sets of collecting societies. One is dealt with in clause 135r which operates in relation to part Va of the Bill, `Copying of television broadcasts by educational and other institutions'. We will have the same annual report structures inserted in 135zzw which relate to part Vc of the Bill, which relates to the use of blank tapes for private and domestic copying. This will ensure that those parts of the Bill which are established under part Vb `Copying of works etc. by educational and other institutions' will also have precisely the same regime imposed in regard to annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we have three sets of collecting societies established under the three parts of part V. In each there will be a requirement not only that they report to the Attorney-General, that they keep their accounts and records correctly, that they enable people to have access to them, that they are properly audited, that members have access to them, and that they comply with any obligations which are established under the law of each State or Territory where the collecting society may be an incorporating body, but also that the Parliament is provided with the information which has been provided to the Attorney-General and to the corporate affairs commissions and whatever it happens to be. Therefore, the Opposition seeks the Minister's cooperation to facilitate that amendment in line with things that have already been inserted into other parts of part V of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to indicate that the very great eloquence of Senator Puplick has struck a responsive chord because he, as I think is proper in this chamber, has a real appreciation of the part that Parliament should play in putting under scrutiny the work of those organisations which are put into a position of some prominence and which exercise some power within our society. It is only fitting in relation to annual reports of such societies as the collecting societies, for example, whose functions are outlined in proposed new section 135r, that such a society upon which such responsibilities are placed shall keep accounting records correctly recording and explaining the transactions of the society, including any transactions as trustee and the financial position of the society. It is also a requirement that the accounting records be kept in such a manner as will enable true and fair accounts of the society to be prepared from time to time and for those accounts to be conveniently and properly audited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for Parliament to make that requirement and impose that responsibility and obligation on the collecting society, but for the Parliament then to walk away from any scrutiny or supervision of the implementation of that requirement or to see whether that obligation has been discharged properly and adequately is, if not a dereliction of duty, something that can be so easily remedied by having the collecting society report to the Parliament and one should take advantage of that opportunity. Indeed, the Attorney-General is to receive a copy of the accounts as so audited. Although it is true that the members of the society can have access to that report and all audited accounts provided under the provision to which I refer, it is perhaps also a good thing that those members of parliament who are concerned to see that the collecting society operates in a way which is in proper discharge of its obligations should have an opportunity to put that under scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in accepting the sorts of parliamentary scrutiny that are outlined by the simple matter of putting an annual report into the Parliament provides an occasion for debate, and perhaps for wider circulation of the report than would be the case if members simply had access to the collecting society's report and to the various audited accounts. I believe that it is essential that Parliament exercise this particular supervisory role, to ensure not only that we as senators are satisfied with the role that we have given to this collecting society, but also that a wider public has access to and knowledge of and is satisfied about the fact that the collecting society is properly discharging its obligation. It is very fitting and not unexpected that this sort of amendment is put forward in this chamber, which of course has a proud record of being concerned to ensure that not merely the Executive is the repository of such reports so that proper general supervision of these sorts of organisations by the elected representatives of the people can take place. For that reason the Government will accept the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the media monitoring provisions and the amendments of Senator Macklin. We, having given this matter consideration in the short time available, have decided that we should not support them at this time. It has become clear to us that the majority in this place, that is, the Government and the Australian Democrats, are not prepared to accept our position in relation to media monitoring, although we think there are good arguments for it. It seems from reading the letters of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) that he thought there were good arguments for it as well. Nevertheless, the Government is the Government and has now overridden-that word may be a bit strong-the Attorney-General. It has taken a position which is opposed to legislating to allow free use of materials, either broadcast or printed, for the purpose of media monitoring organisations. The Australian Democrats have made clear that they are opposed to that position as well and, therefore, I guess the lesson that is now on the record is that this Parliament will not legislate in the form that we have been advocating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That really takes us to the next stage of the debate, that is, whether there should be some form of licence. It is clear on all sides of the chamber that there should be access to the materials in order that information be disseminated as widely as possible. It is the view of the majority in this chamber that it should be information that the media monitors have paid for. </PARA>
<PARA> The detail of such a proposed licensing system is something we think should be given careful consideration in an environment that is not rushed. In fact, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), if I correctly understand his presentation tonight, thinks that a better course of action might be to allow the parties further time to see whether they can reach some form of voluntary licensing arrangement. I guess they will be aided by the debate tonight because they now clearly appreciate where the majority view in this Parliament lies. </PARA>
<PARA> Short of some voluntary arrangement, there would appear to be no sensible alternative but to move to a regulatory licensing regime. That is something that would have to be considered in due course. I presume that the Government will take the matter on board and will in the not too distant future advise the Parliament where it proposes to go in relation to media monitoring, because an unsatisfactory state of affairs seems to exist at the moment. It is unsatisfactory not only because there is current litigation but also because these organisations, which we believe are fulfilling a particularly worthwhile public service, have felt it necessary to press for amendments to clarify their rights in legislative form. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not indicating that we will forever oppose the licensing system but the merits of the licensing system require further consideration from our point of view. Obviously, if we get past the question of principle, the detail requires careful and considered application. We are therefore not prepared to accept the Democrats' amendments at this time. I have indicated accordingly to Senator Macklin. Because Senator Macklin's amendments will now be defeated, I have indicated to him that I see it as pointless and contrary to the spirit in which we have conducted this debate to seek to persist with our amendments. Rather, we will simply leave them in Hansard as an indication of our preferred approach in this difficult area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is somewhat disappointing. One would have hoped that we may have been able to come to some resolution of this matter because it is obviously important, affecting quite a number of companies and the services provided to a very large range of people. It is probably appropriate, given the lack of support for the scheme that I have proposed, that I now withdraw my amendments. I too would hope that in withdrawing those amendments the Government will move with speed to rectify the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has already referred to the Federal Court case that involves a dispute between members of the Australian Journalists Association and a media monitoring service. I do not believe that the outcome of that particular case should necessarily set the way in which we should go. It was embedded within a previous approach to copyright. I believe that I am expressing views very similar to those expressed in the speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) to which I have referred that this is one item that needs to be resolved in recognition of the fact that we are moving into a new and more complex context with regard to copyright. If we do not come to grips with these types of items very early on, all we will do is induce people to seek remedy at law in a very expensive way or to operate on the margins of the law not knowing whether what they are doing is legally correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that it assists the respect that is due to the law if we simply allow this matter to meander until the judges make some decision in the absence of the Parliament managing to get its act together and making a decision in this area. The fact that it is difficult and that there are conflicting rights and obligations is nothing new in the parliamentary context. It is something with which we have to deal every day. I believe a decision should be made. We should operate on that and then review it. It is most ill advised for this matter just simply to be left up in the air for another couple of years. I hope that the Government will use whatever powers it has available-it does have some powers available under regulations with regard to this legislation-to seek to do what it can do to regularise the situation so that all those people concerned will know precisely where they stand. Although they may not be happy with the outcome, at least it will be very clear where they stand. The only assurance given in this context is that the media monitoring services must remain, will remain and are an essential service that people require. I think on that basis we should seek to make sure that they can remain. They will do so only if they remain as profitable organisations. So the fees which are set, if any, cannot be of a kind which would drive these companies out of business. With those comments, I withdraw the two amendments that I have moved with regard to the media monitoring service and hope that the Government will move with speed to rectify the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just comment very briefly on the situation as it has developed and simply say that this is an extremely complex area. I think it is correct to say that the meandering, if that is the term which Senator Macklin used, in relation to this matter has to come to an end at some stage. Whether it will require parliamentary intervention and the imposition of a statutory scheme on what really are two business enterprises-media monitors contracting their services to those who wish to be informed of particular items of interest or concern to them, and the owners of copyright in the print media or in the electronic media-or whether some voluntary agreement can be worked out will depend at least in part on the outcome of the case before the Federal Court between the Australian Journalists Association and media monitors. That may give some guidance and provide some impetus or pressure for a coming together of the parties so that a nationwide voluntary scheme can be arrived at. If we do not have to get involved, then so much the better, but if indeed it proves the case that the media monitors and the various organisations which have copyright in various broadcast material or published material cannot get together, then Senator Hill and Senator Macklin have quite correctly indicated that the matter would need to be returned to the Parliament for our decision. To make a decision in this area would not be easy, but I do think that, as always, the sort of balance that must be achieved between the two parties is something with which we are familiar as parliamentarians and a decision will be forth- coming. All I can do is give an undertaking to the Senate chamber that on the bringing down of the decision by the Federal Court we will all be in a much better position to understand what the next step ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>

What we are providing here is a licensing regime for radio broadcasts that are copied by educational institutions for use for educational purposes which is in addition to the existing provisions that are included in section 200, not in substitution thereof.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was interrupted on 7 April I was talking about Senator Puplick's suggestion that the Opposition was going to move an amendment to require the Electoral Commission to take account of the voting intentions in an election to ensure that 50 per cent plus one of the popular vote represented the majority in the number of seats won.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the time, this is a proposition which has been tried before by the Liberal Party of Australia. I remember in 1976 in South Australia when the one vote one value Bill was first accepted and introduced in South Australia by the Dunstan Labor Government. The Liberal Party tried to convince the then Independent Electoral Commission in South Australia that it should draw electoral boundaries taking account of voting results per polling booth, as this was a way of defining community of interest. If one had taken it that way, one would have ended up with the most extraordinary electoral boundaries. One would have probably ended up with seats which would have never changed hands at election time. One would have had seats, by definition, that were overwhelmingly Liberal or overwhelmingly Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> It is technically not a feasible proposition. It will not work. It has not worked anywhere else in the world where there is a single constituency system. If Senator Puplick wants that proposal to work he will have to go and adopt the whole hog approach of a proportional representation system on a list voting system that applies in particular in a number of Western European countries. It cannot be done, however, in a single constituency system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that he and other Liberal Party spokespeople have complained bitterly about the Western Australian election result earlier this year in that in the two-party preferred result the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia got over 50 per cent of the vote and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) got less than 50 per cent. I do not dispute that. That is clear from a mathematical analysis of all the votes counted. It is true that on a two-party preferred basis, the Liberal Party would have won the election. It did not win the election because it refused to support the introduction of one vote one value in Western Australia when that proposal was put forward by the Burke Labor Government two or three years ago. It wanted to keep the bias in favour of rural electorates; to have larger enrolments in the city and lower enrolments in the rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The irony is that it is probable that if they had supported the Burke Government proposal for one vote one value, they would be the government of Western Australia today. I think it is one of the great and deliciously sweet ironies of Australian politics that the parties which opposed the introduction of one vote one value-which has been ALP national policy for over 20 years-paid the penalty, in a short-sighted way, in supporting a rural gerrymander, because that was all the Burke Government could get at the time. What happened to them, much to their chagrin, was that the Labor Party did very well in the small rural electorates of northern Western Australia. I understand that the whole of outback Western Australia is now represented by Labor Party electorates; they are much smaller in terms of enrolment, but that is what the Liberal party insisted upon two or three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney and Senator Puplick cry out now about how unfair it is. It is unfair, but that is what they wanted. I suggest to them that they contact the Western Australian State Liberal Party and suggest that it introduce and support a Labor Party policy for one vote one value in Western Australia. That might mean that the Liberal Party might win a future election. But the Labor Party's view is very well known on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick suggested that we should be holding up this Bill until we get the report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on its review of the 1987 Federal election, because these proposals come from the review of the 1984 Federal election. As a member of that Joint Standing Committee, I would have to say to Senator Puplick that I do not believe we would have those recommendations ready in time to be dealt with by the end of this year. We would then be getting very close to the next Federal election. One thing that we are dealing with which has created some controversy and which I hope this chamber will be able to debate some time before the next election is the question of election advertising on television and radio. The Joint Standing Committee is receiving evidence from television stations and from other witnesses about the high cost for all political parties of election advertising on television and radio, but television in particular. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On recent figures, it would save at least $5m or $6m. The television stations and networks have been saying that if we ban paid political advertising on television and radio we will infringe people's political rights to free expression. That is a very hollow suggestion. If we do not have large amounts of money, we cannot advertise on television. Senator Haines suggests that the Australian Democrats are short of a quid now and again. Even the Australian Labor Party is short of a quid more than now and again and I suggest that the Liberal Party is short of a quid to pay for the level of television advertising it would like.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The way the evidence is going-we have not completed the hearings-there is a growing case to say that we should restrict or ban paid television and radio advertising and make it a requirement under the public function of commercial broadcasters that there is a limited amount of free time available on a proportionate basis to all political parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We could also look at an option which has been raised in Committee hearings. In 1976 the Australian Government banned outright all tobacco advertising on television. The television stations did not like it. It cost them a lot of revenue. They did not go broke; they are still in operation. Maybe we should just ban full stop paid advertising on television and radio and just allow television and radio to carry out the editorial function of providing election coverage in current affairs and news services. I suspect a majority of viewers and listeners in Australia would not be upset with the proposition that for four weeks of a federal election campaign they would not be bombarded with a saturation coverage of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> There are fundamental issues about access and equity in running election campaigns. The Parliament and the Australian community must come to grips with what the high costs of television and radio advertising, particularly television costs, are doing to the operation of democracy in Australia. In the end, it will mean that the two major political parties will have to beggar themselves to those who make the major contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> I can say openly that in the last 10 or 15 years the Labor Party, like the Liberal Party, has overwhelmingly relied on corporate donations to pay for its election expenses-its television costs. I do not believe it is healthy for the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, or even the Queensland National Party, to have to rely on donations from one sector of the community alone to pay for advertising to conduct their election campaigns. In the end, it means that it will bend and twist the function of political parties. Irrespective of our political backgrounds and our other political differences, it is incumbent upon all political parties to ensure that into the next century party political activity in Australia and parliamentary democracy can operate openly without the destructive impact of the high cost of election campaigning. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to participating further in discussions with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as it deals with this issue. Without prejudging what the Committee may recommend, I certainly hope that it comes forward with a constructive suggestion to put before the Parliament to overcome this pressing problem in the operation of democracy in Australia. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988 has been on again, off again for some considerable time. The Bill was first introduced into the Parliament something like 12 months ago, so it has been lying around for a considerable time. That has caused various problems of a nature which would warrant the Government's withdrawing the Bill for the time being and waiting on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, to which Senator Schacht referred. The Committee will be reporting to the Parliament, it is hoped, by the end of this session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems odd to me that we are now debating a Bill which is about to become outdated, or at least overtaken. The Bill before us contains various amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, but the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is winding up its report on changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act in light of the experience of the 1988 referendums and the 1987 general federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Joint Standing Committee, I, like Senator Schacht, am constrained in what I can say on it at this stage, but it is quite clear that the very broad-ranging nature of the reference before the Joint Standing Committee means that it will make a wide range of recommendations, some of which will be quite fundamental. It would seem to be no more than commonsense to delay the finalisation of this Bill-indeed, to withdraw this Bill-until such time as the Parliament can look at what is proposed in it along with the very wide range of recommendations which will be forthcoming. My first point is that it is unfortunate that we are debating the Bill at all at this time, because it should be deferred pending the Joint Standing Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is designed to give legislative effect to the remaining acceptable recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform that reported in 1984 and again in 1986. The recommendations that are in those reports of what was then the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, which are swept up into this Bill, have been around for some considerable time. Indeed, because they have been around for some considerable time, I am very surprised indeed that the Bill in several respects is very shoddy in its drafting. Perhaps I should not be surprised at that because we have seen increasing evidence in recent times of a very dangerous shoddiness of drafting in legislation coming before the Parliament. It has been of such a nature that the legislation has required an enormous number of amendments. In many cases, I guess we have not picked up the faults that have been in the legislation before us and so have enacted faulty legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the second reading speech it is said that the Bill is to provide a fixed formula for the representation of Territories and new States in the Federal Parliament. That is not correct. The Bill is not able to provide formulae for the representation of new States in the Federal Parliament. That matter will have to be looked at quite separately. Such is the nature of the drafting of the Bill and the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) that that was not picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations in the Bill are numerous and in the committee stage we will propose various amendments to the Bill as it is presently drafted. I will not go into those tonight because they will be the subject of a committee debate. However, I foreshadow, as did Senator Puplick on the Opposition's behalf, that we will oppose several of the amendments contained in the Bill. What I wish to do tonight in the second reading is raise several points concerning the whole area of electoral matters, including the question of just how easy we have made the electoral system over recent years to be subject to fraud. The integrity of the electoral system is an important issue for the confidence of the electorate, for the confidence of the nation. To say that we really have a democratic system is as important as anything else that we can do. </PARA>

All we need to do is look at the interim report on Rothwells Ltd that was tabled and debated in this place yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Returning to the question of fraud in the electoral system, I repeat what I said: if voters lose confidence in the integrity of our rolls, our voting systems and our voting procedures, we have put a very large dent in our democratic process. I do not necessarily point the finger at this Government but what has happened to a very marked extent under this Government in recent years has resulted in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the electoral process in this country being made far too easy to manipulate. That statement has been echoed by many people around the country. Indeed, the Report of the Inquiry into the Operations and Processes for the Conduct of State Elections, which was released a couple of months ago in New South Wales, made a very similar point. The commissioners of that inquiry were very expert people in this area. They were the New South Wales State Electoral Commissioner for the period 1974 to 1982, who was appointed by the Askin Government, and Mr Dickson, who is present State Electoral Commissioner for New South Wales, who was appointed by the Wran Government. So it would be difficult to say that that committee was biased in any way. That committee, which reported a couple of months ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA> That the electoral system as it presently exists is open to manipulation is beyond question but the deliberate perpetration of electoral fraud on a major scale is much less certain. Nevertheless the possibility exists that it could occur and consequently steps should be taken to ensure that it does not. To be more precise, loopholes are evident in both the areas of enrolment and voting.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee said further:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that there are mechanisms available to the electoral administration to virtually eliminate fraudulent voting. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of the voting that the Committee referred to in the report was votes being cast in the names of deceased electors, called cemetery voting. That can have different connotations. Indeed, in a roll cleanse in one of the New South Wales electorates near Canberra for the last State election the address found on the electoral roll against some names was the cemetery. If people had gone to do a habitation review, they would have ended up in the cemetery. </PARA>

Multiple voting is a problem and an issue. In all Federal elections and in recent State elections, multiple voting has been a problem. On investigation, it is said not to have been a sufficient enough problem to have caused a false result in any electorate. I accept that point but the fact that it can and does arise-and the evidence I have suggests that it is on the increase-makes me increasingly worried about where the electoral system is going. We have become too user friendly in terms of what we have done to the electoral system and that is something we should be looking at very carefully.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A balance has to be struck. The sysem must not be made so user friendly that it is susceptible to fraud. Certainly on this side of politics we want it wiped out. When this side of politics does become the Government following the next election I would be absolutely amazed if we do not take steps to change the system so as to make it much more difficult for the electoral rolls and the electoral process to be manipulated. The Bill does not touch at all on the question of electoral fraud and the ease with which it can be perpetrated. If we are really serious about doing something about the electoral system that is something that we should take into account when discussing important pieces of legislation such as this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to the question of the cleanliness of the electoral rolls. Every member of this Parliament knows, because of our day to day contact with constituents, including new enrollees, that the electoral rolls are in a very unclean state. I am sure that all senators send communications to people who have newly come onto the electoral roll. We are advised about the people who have come onto the electoral roll within a couple of weeks of their registering. The proportion of new enrollee letters that are returned to our offices is very high indeed. I cannot understand how we can have a return rate of other than minuscule proportions of new enrollee letters because the address to which the letters are sent should not be more than a couple of weeks or a month or so old. Therefore, there should be virtually a nil return of letters from those addresses, but in fact we get a not insignificant proportion. The Commonwealth Electoral Commission admitted that, as of 31 December 1987, only five months after a Federal election, in my State of Victoria alone there were 60,000 people on the electoral roll who should not have been there. They were only identified after the election had occurred. Had that roll been clean, in the sense of being accurate, the result of the 1987 election in some of the key marginal seats in Victoria-because that was probably the State, more than any other, where the election was lost for the Liberal Party and National Party--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Aulich" NAMEID="JE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Queensland as well. Had the roll been accurate, the results in some of those marginal electorates could well have been different. We will never know whether the results would have been different, but the fact remains that 60,000 people were identified as being on the roll who should not have been. That must open up the possibility that the election results, particularly in close electorates, may well have been different had the roll been more accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I have never understood in our system is that the state of the roll is not a valid reason for challenging the outcome of an election result. In the seat of Ballarat South in my own State of Victoria, which the Liberal Party lost at the last Victorian State election by 103 votes-that is 52 voters-1,506 names on the roll were identified as not being legitimately on the roll. Despite that, that fact was not allowable as a reason for disputing the result of the election. That is crazy. It is something which we ought to look at on a bipartisan basis. It is not a matter of necessarily favouring one party rather than another. Certainly the situation of the roll and its cleanliness is something which we ought to look at much more closely than we have. That raises such fundamental questions, which are not addressed in this Bill, as to whether there could be an earlier cut-off date than now exists for the closing of the roll after the calling of an election. </PARA>

All I am saying is that it is an important issue which we should look at, and which this Bill does not address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing that concerns me is that there is no guarantee that members of parliament or members of the public will have available to them a printed electoral roll in time for consideration at an election. There has not been a printed electoral roll in this country since 1984. The last hard copy of an electoral roll that was generally available was printed in 1984. That is patently a totally unsatisfactory situation. We need to consider whether a printed roll should be available a certain time prior to a Federal election. </PARA>

I am not sure whether Senator Schacht was here when I said that this Bill should be withdrawn and reconsidered only after our Committee has reported, along with other recommendations that might flow from that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another aspect about our electoral system which concerns me very much at the moment is the operation of the Australian Electoral Commission. I have been very disturbed over the last couple of years at the performance, some of the actions and, particularly, some of the comments of senior members of the Australian Electoral Commission. I will give a couple of examples. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, as I mentioned earlier, is considering the Commonwealth Electoral Act in the light of the 1987 election. It called for submissions and received a wide range, including some from my own Party, the Liberal Party. Several months later the Australian Electoral Commission gratuitously responded to that submission by the Liberal Party. In relation to the Liberal Party's suggestion it made such comments as this:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the submission's authors are totally ignorant of the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act--</PARA>
<PARA>The phrase on which the Liberal Party was reporting presumably means a particular definition, and is not relevant one way or the other. My point is that it is totally insulting and gratuitous to have a statement from the Electoral Commission, sanctioned by the Electoral Commissioner, describing the authors of a responsible submission as being totally ignorant of the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act because, of course, they were not. The Electoral Commissioner's final comment in response to the Liberal Party's submission was:</PARA>
<PARA> The submission's contribution to the perception in the minds of many voters that the administration of the electoral process is not adequate by repeating such an extraordinary collection of quarter truths and total fabrications devalues its protestations of concern about the consequences to the vanishing point. </PARA>
<PARA>They are highly unprofessional statements by the Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner and are indicative of some of the statements that he has been making in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example, not concerning criticism of my own Party, may be seen in a document submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters by the Electoral Commissioner in relation to comments on a document that had been produced by other authors on the question of electoral integrity. The Electoral Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA> The authors of the document are both non-entities and the assertions it contains are irrational or unsupported by evidence or both. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very unprofessional, denigrating and snide comments which do no credit to the Electoral Commission and damage the electoral process. There is no doubt at all that there are difficulties at the moment within the Commonwealth Electoral Commission. The Joint Standing Committee has received many comments from divisional returning officers expressing their views in response to a request from the Committee as to the operation of the 1987 election process and the 1988 referendum process. Those comments, by and large, were very damaging and demonstrate a considerable lack of morale within the Electoral Commission, particularly on the coalface where it all happens and where the validity and integrity of the electoral process really begins and ends; that is, out in the divisional returning offices. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to say a couple of things about the conduct of the Australian Electoral Commission in relation to the referendum campaigns last year. The Electoral Commission was responsible for the publication of the Yes and No cases pamphlet. As we all now know, the general feeling throughout the community was that the document that was produced was highly biased. The printing obviously favoured enormously the Yes case-that is, the Government's case-and the Electoral Commission, having given some responses as to why that happened, has absolved itself of blame. I do not believe that that is good enough, and I do not believe that the Australian people believe that it is good enough. Indeed, it was a tribute to the perspicacity of the Australian electorate that it so overwhelmingly rejected those referendum proposals of the Government last year and, thereby, appeared not to be overly influenced by the pamphlets it had received, which were so heavily biased in favour of the Yes case. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter that has to be addressed and looked at very seriously indeed. Of course, it is not addressed at all in this Bill. Nor are many other significant matters in respect of referendums. For example, the Senate rejected two or three Bills that had been put up last year by the coalition in an attempt to ensure that the questions put to the electorate in referendums reflect accurately the content of a proposed change to the Constitution. I refer, for example, to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) (Fair Questions) Amendment Bill, which I had the privilege of introducing in this chamber on behalf of the coalition. That Bill was thrown out by the Government. We did not receive support from the Democrats either, regardless of the purity of the Bill. That is another matter that requires addressing because it is patently clear that the legislative provisions relating to the wording of referendum questions in Australia are not satisfactory. As happened last year, there can be put to the Australian people questions relating to changes in the Constitution that give no accurate or adequate reflection of the fundamental nature of the changes being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the ludicrous situation-which has still not been resolved-whereby the electorate was confused as to whether a tick was a valid vote in a referendum, and whether certain combinations of ticks and crosses were valid. The result of that, of course, was massive confusion and, again, considerable bias in favour of the Yes case. Fortunately, that was rejected by the people. So, in the electoral system there are many matters of grave concern which we all ought to be addressing very carefully indeed. I believe that those matters are not dealt with in any measure of this Bill, and I urge the Government to withdraw it. Let us have another look at it in the light of all the further changes that may well be proposed as a result of the report currently being finalised by the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last comment of Senator Short certainly has merit. It seems to me that the fact that this Bill has languished so long on the Notice Paper brings it into the area where it could very well be superseded by a further report from the committee that has been looking at the last election. It might be advisable for the Government to consider whether any of those arguments could be put in legislation form. Undoubtedly, there will be only one run at such a Bill before the next election. The history of the exercise so far is that the reports from the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters have been accepted by the Parliament. The vast bulk of the recommendations have been unanimous and have found their way into legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only the majority reports that have found their way into legislation; some minority reports also have. I served as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, as it was then, from its formation in 1983 until last year. I appreciate the Committee's workload. I was most impressed by the depth of analysis of the various items that came before the Committee. Unlike Senator Short, I think that Australian federal electoral law is one of the best electoral laws anywhere in the world. It is one of the very few laws to have been scrutinised rigorously by a parliamentary committee. The Joint Committee has recommended changes which have been accepted by Parliament. Those changes have been re-examined in terms of how they may have operated in an actual election context and the report has resulted in further changes which, again, have been adopted by Parliament. The Committee is now in the process of looking again at the changes that were made as a result of its second major report-not the second report, but the second major report-on electoral matters to see how they worked. So I cannot accept the litany of criticism made by Senator Short with regard to the electoral law. </PARA>
<PARA> Electoral Acts can always be improved-there is no doubt about that-but members of all political parties in this place have a lot to be proud of in respect of the electoral laws at Federal level in terms of the extent of the franchise that we have been able to achieve. Indeed, some people have been critical of the fact that we have gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that all Australian citizens are able to register and to vote. I refer, for example, to citizens who work in the Antarctic, who used to be deprived of the vote but now get it; to itinerant workers, who used to be deprived of the vote by the nature of their occupation, but no longer are; and to women who, after leaving home with their children because they were bashed by their husbands, did not go on the electoral roll because they might be able to be traced, but who are now able to go on a silent electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA>It is pretty easy to criticise, but let us look at the state of the Act before all this activity took place. I urge Senator Short, if he is not aware of the massive contrast, to read the first report of the Committee with regard to the basic electoral law. I think that he, like me, indeed, like all members of the Committee-will be stunned by the corruption of that system that crept in over a myriad of years. I am referring not to corruption of individuals but to corruption of the system. On one occasion we found that public servants had decided that they did not like the way in which, under the Act, women were not required, when they married, to change their maiden name on the roll unless they wished to do so. Whether the name was changed on the roll was entirely at their discretion. The bureaucrats decided that they did not like that and they made the women re-enrol under their married names, or knocked them off the roll if they did not. That was entirely contrary to the Act, even as it operated, having been passed by this Parliament in the 1940s. That had nothing to do with the new found position. Quite rightly the Parliament said that, under the Electoral Act, it was not a matter of dictate that that should occur. But obviously, in practice, it did not carry the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like at least to register my appreciation of the work that has been done by the Committee over the years and the work that has been done by the Parliament in improving that Act. I believe that, while changes can be made, we have gone a long way. I think one of the items that will stand to the credit of this Government is that it was willing to take on the task of reforming the electoral laws and to give that its best run. That time, energy and effort was not put in by previous governments for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the minority recommendations that I made, which appears in this Bill, was a dissenting report to the first report of the Joint Committee in September 1983, in which I urged that those citizens who had already been deprived of their liberty because of a prison sentence were suffering a double penalty under the current legislation because they were not allowed to vote. At the time I noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Having established a duty to vote with a penalty for non-compliance it is odd for the Committee to exempt certain citizens from that obligation and that penalty because they are serving prison sentences. The removal of political rights because of civil or criminal offence was entirely inappropriate for a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA>I stand by that statement. One of the things that was often held against the Soviet Union was the fact that it deprived people of political rights by using other methods. It seems to me highly incongruous that, while that type of criticism was being made of the Soviet Union at that time, people were happy to condone it in Australia. The Government has picked up that matter in this legislation. I am pleased to see it because, as the Minister has said, we now have a more rational and consistent approach to the recognition of voting rights and responsibilities. I argued this matter very strongly at the beginning of this Committee and I am pleased to see that it has now infused the whole of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Political rights stem from citizenship. I know that, at that time, this was a ticklish problem. I argued very strongly that, ticklish or not, we should grasp the nettle and say that the right to vote was a right that flowed from citizenship in this country. People should be entitled to vote not because they happen to live here but because they are citizens. Some residents of this country are still entitled to vote but no new residents are able to be added to the roll. So, in a short space of time, our electoral rolls will be made up-as they should have been for a long period-entirely of citizens. If one is a citizen one is entitled to vote, whether or not one is in gaol. As I have said, one's voting rights stem from one's citizenship, not from one's situation in terms of civil or criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA> I have submitted other dissenting reports. In fact, I was able to join later with Senator Collins, operating in his previous capacity as a member representing the Northern Territory at a constitutional convention, on a vote against quite a number of his colleagues on the question of the Northern Territory becoming a State and whether it should be on a par with the original States. I saw no justification whatsoever for the argument in the majority report at that time-which was signed by all members of the Australian Labour Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia-that if the Northern Territory became a State it should be treated in a way other than the original States that were represented in this chamber. I am still very much of that view because I believe that the philosophy of the exercise is impeccable. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you have a very strong views on this matter also. When you were a Minister I remember you telling me of those views at around 2.00 or 3.00 one morning when we were waiting for a Bill to come back from the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, although you were persuasive as always, I still hold to my view-although it might not be shared by many-that ultimately, the only way for the constitutional principle upon which the Senate is founded to be able to operate is for every State to be represented in this chamber on an equal basis. I made a dissenting report in December 1986 on other matters which are pertinent to this Bill. The recommendation of the Committee was:</PARA>
<PARA>The surname, given names, address, occupation, sex and date of birth of each elector should be available on the electoral roll and on the publicly available microfiche of the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA>I dissented from that recommendation and I will continue to argue that we should eliminate all unnecessary details from the electoral roll. The Government, after due consideration, picked up my dissenting report as it desired at that stage to reintroduce the words `sex' and `occupation' on the electoral roll. The issue of sex is a non-issue because unless two people are living in the same house and they both have the same surnames there could not possibly be any confusion. But even worse is the notion of occupation. I have no idea what occupation has to do with the right to vote. It may be useful for political parties. We do not establish the roles for political parties; we establish them to determine the right to vote. I believe that the minimum of information ought to appear on the electoral roll and that information should be used only for the purposes for which it is gathered. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to a stimulating debate in the committee stage of this Bill, whenever we manage to get to it. The way in which this Bill has been meandering through the Senate that should be some time next year. I look forward to a stimulating debate on why we should collect information from citizens for the purpose of the electoral roll, operate a private enterprise exercise, and tout that information around to the highest bidder. I am totally opposed to that and I will be seeking to move an amendment with regard to that matter in the committee stage. I will also be seeking to move amendments with regard to a number of other matters-most notably what I have entitled `the licence to lie' that is provided for political parties in the Electoral Act. I assume that, as has happened in the past, we will do nothing about that. I know ultimately we will have to do something about that as there is pressure from the electorate. I hope that, at least in the committee stage, people will be able to bring forward some slightly more rational and reasonable arguments as to why they believe companies in Australia should tell the truth when they advertise but political parties should have absolutely no obligation to do anything about the truth when they advertise. I look forward to debating in the committee stage that and other matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a great deal of debate over the past year or so on the progress of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I have been involved in this debate and I know that honourable senators who have followed this issue may recall the observations that I made on Commissioner Muirhead's interim report which, among other things, canvassed the fact that Aboriginal people do not die in prison at a greater rate in terms of their percentage of the prison population than non-Aboriginal prisoners, but are imprisoned at an appal- lingly higher rate than non-Aboriginal prisoners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been widespread and legitimate public concern about the cost of the Commission, the time it is taking to complete its job and its potential benefit to both the Aboriginal and wider Australian community. Much of that concern relates to the widespread impression in the community that the Commission is simply covering old ground already canvassed by coronial inquiries. That is a concern that I have felt myself. However, now that I have had the opportunity to read Commissioner Muirhead's interim report, the seven individual reports on deaths so far published, and in addition evidence taken by the Commission, particularly in the Northern Territory, that concern has been completely removed and replaced with a far greater concern for the standard of the coronial processes into deaths in custody in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to address this issue tonight for a particular reason. In response to a question from me in Question Time the Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, advised the Senate that a number of refinements have been made to the operations of the Commission by setting a cut off date for new investigations, by procedures to reduce the time and cost of the individual inquiries, consistent with maintaining the high standard of those inquiries and other important matters. The Commissioners, I know, along with many others with an interest in this issue, want the Commission to present its final report by December 1990. Consistent with this desire it is essential to complete the majority of the individual hearings by the end of this year. In order to achieve this end it is imperative that an additional commissioner be appointed in Western Australia to replace Commissioner Muirhead. Western Australia has the greatest number of deaths to investigate, currently standing at 34. Statistically that State has the greatest problem in this area, which is further regrettably complicated by the refusal of the Western Australian police and prison officers to cooperate with the Commission-a matter which I assure the Senate is of great regret to at least some of their interstate colleagues. Indeed, I would ask the two bodies in Western Australia that I have just mentioned in their own interests and in the interests of justice to rethink their position on this. </PARA>
<PARA> My remarks this evening are therefore particularly directed, with respect, to my colleague the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Peter Dowding. Mr Dowding said recently that he would not support the appointment of a second commissioner until the Commission had, to quote him, `a change of direction' and he went on to say that the Commission was `simply rehashing old coronial inquiries'. As well as being a Labor colleague of mine, Mr Dowding is a prominent figure in the Australian Labor Party and one for whom I have considerable respect. I did share the same concerns about this matter as he does, but I do hope that when he gives further consideration to this issue his concerns will be allayed as mine have been, and that he will support the appointment of an additional commissioner in Western Australia. I note that he is to meet soon with Commissioner Elliot Johnson to discuss this and I hope that the meeting will be productive. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, one of the issues that has been raised again and again is that the Commission is simply going over the ground of coronial inquiries. Were this the case, it is clear from reading the interim report that Commissioner Muirhead himself would question the role of the Commission. A careful examination of the case by case reports however completely dispels this criticism. To quote from the interim report at page 58, after Commissioner Muirhead canvasses what should be done in a coronial inquiry, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>If this degree of thoroughness, the implementation of such expertise, had been current in Australia over past years, it is arguable that the necessity for the establishment of this Royal Commission would not have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA>Having read the reports, I can only agree with that conclusion. Of the seven reports already published all raise grave concerns about the standard of post-death investigations revealed by the work of the Commission. It is fair to say that in many of the cases reported on the standards have been so deficient as to make the findings of the investigations completely unreliable. The failings and inadequacies of the coronial processes have in some cases been gross and have involved failures in all stages of the process-in the police investigation, the pathology investigation and the coronial inquiries and findings themselves. The failures have involved errors of both commission and omission. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns that I raise now in detail are not exhaustive-and I stress that, but I cannot do this in the time available-but they will serve to demonstrate the extent to which this concern is justified. Without at this point going into any detail about specific cases in Queensland, I would note that in seven of the 24 cases being investigated of deaths in custody in Queensland, no inquest was held into these deaths at all. In a situation where a person is held in custody and the custody of that person involves the deprivation of their liberty by the State, there is a very special responsibility by the State towards the care of that person. There should be no circumstances whatever, no matter how obvious or prejudged the death might be in terms of its cause-and this clearly is a feature in a lot of these cases-in which a death in custody ought not to involve a coronial process. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn specifically to the death of Kingsley Richard Dixon. The coroner held that Kingsley Dixon had been strip searched in a lawful manner. The Commission, however, found that the strip search was conducted in absolute contravention of the prison manager's directions. This is outlined on page 24 of the report. The Commission further found that a deliberate agreement between the prison officers occurred to falsify their reports to cover up this breach. It was known by the coroner that Kingsley Dixon was profoundly affected by drugs and that his condition led to his being strip searched by the prison officers. Despite this, the coroner made no finding on the management of Kingsley Dixon in his drug affected state. The Commission, in contrast, found that the prison management rules which are set out in the report had been `totally ignored'. I refer to pages 29 and 30 where specific management rules laid down for drug affected prisoners had not been implemented. Even more disturbing, the Commission went on to find-and I quote from the findings of the Commission at pages 65 and 66 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Kingsley Dixon was substantially and obviously under the influence of a drug or drugs when he was initially searched and when he died. </PARA>
<PARA>2. He was strip searched in `A' Wing, his cell was searched in his absence and was left in an untidy state. No effort was made to obtain a medical assessment. Relevant prison regulations appear to have been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>4. The officers who placed Kingsley in his cell and secured it, have not been frank as to what then occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>I then refer to the following findings:</PARA>
<PARA>8. An initial attempt was made to conceal the fact that he was searched in `A' Wing. </PARA>
<PARA>9. He was not treated with the care his obvious condition required. </PARA>
<PARA>Most disturbing was finding 3:</PARA>
<PARA>If such regulations had been followed it is unlikely that Kingsley would have died that day. </PARA>
<PARA>The coroner made no criticism at all of the treatment of Kingsley Dixon by prison officers. In contrast, Commissioner Muirhead found at page 65 that the prison officers had contravened the very regulations that were designed to be applied in the case of drug affected prisoners such as Kingsley Dixon. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Commissioner made a finding as to the cause of death which was substantially different from that of the coroner. The coroner found that Kingsley Dixon committed suicide. Commissioner Muirhead, however, found at finding 7 on page 66:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unlikely that Kingsley intended to take his own life; his actions probably influenced by drugs consumed were in the form of a protest but death ensued rapidly in a manner he did not contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA>The disturbing thing about this finding is that it was made on the basis of a body of compelling evidence set out in the report that was readily provided to the Commission and would just as easily have been available to the coroner had it been sought. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Edward James Murray there were a number of unsatisfactory matters found by Commissioner Muirhead in relation to the procedures carried out in this highly controversial death. These included matters such as those set out on page 133 of the report. However, the most important differences in the two inquiries-that is, the coronial inquiry and the Commission's inquiry-relate once again to the ultimate findings as to the cause of death. The coroner returned an `open finding' on the cause of death-in other words, he left the question of foul play open. Commissioner Muirhead, however, rejected that finding. Once again, a substantial body of evidence was adduced by the Commission which could have been called by the coroner but was not called. This led to the rejection by Commissioner Muirhead of the coroner's finding. Commissioner Muirhead was able to reach a concluded view that the death of Edward James Murray was not murder. This is made clear in the body of the report itself dealing with the hypothesis that foul play had occurred and in the findings of Commissioner Muirhead. I quote from findings 5 and 17 at page 131 of the report. Finding 5 is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>He was placed in the cell by Moseley and Parker. I am concerned that the officers have not been frank about what took place at this time but there is no evidence to justify a finding of a physical assault, let alone an assault capable of producing unconsciousness or death. </PARA>
<PARA>Finding 17 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>On the whole of the evidence and material now before me it is more probable than not that death resulted by Eddie's own actions. This does not justify a finding of suicide for reasons set out in my report concerning the death of Kingsley Dixon. </PARA>
<PARA> In the death of John Clarence Highfold, Commissioner Muirhead noted numerous failures in the police inquiries into the death which led to the following statement by the Commissioner at page 36 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> Detective Connor said that during the course of his investigations he received no directions from the Coroner's office, he presumed that Highfold died as a result of epilepsy, although he had no medical knowledge, did not attend the autopsy, obtain a copy of the post mortem report or make any medical inquiries whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The investigation was not thorough and provided little information for the Coroner or the pathologist. I agree with the submission of Counsel Assisting that it appears to have been conducted `in an atmosphere of pre judgment and in a sense of routine' and was performed by Detective Connor from the standpoint (to use his own words) of `a simple death in custody'. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also be noted that the inquest was conducted without witnesses being called at all and without the family being represented at the inquest or even being present. In conclusion, Commissioner Muirhead found the conclusion of the pathologist which was accepted by the coroner that the death of John Clarence Highfold was caused by Status epilepticus was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In the death of Charles Sydney Michael, Commissioner Muirhead held at page 29 of the report that the police investigation had been carried out in an ad hoc manner by inexperienced officers and held further at page 29 of the report in respect of the entire process of this investigation that:</PARA>
<PARA>I hold a strong view that the system in operation when Michael died was unsatisfactory and I cannot accept that investigation by officers of the Internal Investigation Unit should be regarded as sufficient . . . In this area special considerations apply. These are matters which must be fully addressed after general evidence is heard. </PARA>
<PARA>Police failed to follow their own routine orders to involve the Criminal Investigation Bureau in an investigation of his death. Police seized and then lost containers of body fluid for analysis and this fact was not known to the coroner. Again, in the final finding on the cause of death the coroner found that the death was due to a heart attack, possibly due to arhythmia caused by amitriptyline. Commissioner Muirhead did not accept that the drug would have caused arhythmia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the death of Christine Lesley Ann Jones, very interesting issues were raised in the case. Commissioner O'Dea was extremely unhappy, not surprisingly, that the investigation of this death was carried out by one of the officers who was involved in the detention of the person who had died. At page 20 of his report, he also made the following criticisms of the coronial inquests:</PARA>
<PARA>In my opinion the Coronial Inquest was deficient in three respects. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) The officer who assisted the Coroner was a serving police officer. It was inappropriate to have a serving police officer assisting the Coroner when the deaths to be investigated occurred at a police lockup. That proposition required no elaboration since it is clear there is a potential for conflict . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Coroner did not seek to discover why Christine Jones died as distinct from how she died . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The question of failure of the police officers to perform expired air resuscitation upon Christine was not raised at the inquest. There was no evidence before the Coroner as to the futility of cardiac massage alone. Nor was there evidence that in fact a manual resuscitator was kept at the Midland Police Station a resuscitator of which neither Constable Glew nor Constable Smallwood were aware and the presence of which Sergeant Sharp failed to recall. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner O'Dea then made a range of positive recommendations arising from the evidence taken on this death, none of which were made by the coroner. I might add that this has been a feature of all of the Commissioners' reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Into the death of Malcolm Charles Smith, Commissioner Wootten made a number of criticisms of the police investigations, the pathological examination and the coroner's inquest, including the failure to interview either medical officers or prisoners after the death, and again no family being represented at the inquest or even present. Commissioner Wootten criticised the police report to the coroner for a serious error. This error involved a statement made to the coroner by the police that Malcolm Charles Smith had made numerous attempts to kill himself previously, evidence which in fact was clearly wrong. Commissioner Wootten rejected the coroner's finding that Malcolm Charles Smith's death was suicide. He said at page 6:</PARA>
<PARA>The police investigation was not thorough. No prisoner witnesses were interviewed. It was accepted with virtually no investigation that Malcolm had intended to kill himself on this and on earlier occasions of self-injury. Inadequate investigation of this issue continued at the coronial inquiry and, as a result, the coroner wrongly found that Malcolm's death was suicide. His death was the result of self-inflicted injury, but not with the intention of taking his own life. </PARA>
<PARA>Again those findings are repeated on page 66 of the report where the coroner is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I find that Malcolm Smith's death was caused by his own action in driving the paint brush into his eye with his own hand. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a tragic death. The coroner found death by suicide, in other words, that Malcolm intended to take his life. In my view, the evidence did not and does not support such a finding. The Commissioner goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I find that Malcolm Smith did not intend to kill himself and accordingly that his death was not suicide. </PARA>
<PARA>The report in fact lays out very clearly that what Malcolm Smith was doing, as he had done on two previous occasions, was following the biblical injunction to pluck out his offending eye because of the guilt he felt over the death of the person whose life he took. </PARA>
<PARA> One case that has not been reported but which I followed with great interest is the death of a Northern Territory Aboriginal, the first recorded case of an Aboriginal in the Northern Territory committing suicide by hanging. At the hearings in the Northern Territory senior police officers gave evidence to the Commission which, in my view, was astonishing in respect of the actions taken in this case. Among other things, they told the Commission that they had presumed that the death was suicide. No attempt whatever was made to investigate the cause of an unexplained injury to the back of the head of the deceased. The evidence of a prison officer was accepted that a cell check was made at 6 a.m.; yet a medical report received the day after the inquest which claimed that the death by hanging had occurred before 4.30 a.m. was not even brought to the attention of the coroner. The question whether suicide was physically possible was barely examined. The police interviewed no prisoners. Of the three officers on duty at the time of the death, only one was interviewed. His word was accepted, without any further scrutiny, that the death was suicide. The coroner's constable reported to the coroner before the autopsy had been performed that death was suicide. No exhibits were seized by the police. No police records or journals were examined. No investigation was conducted as to the motive for suicide. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have succeeded in laying out evidence-I assure you, Mr President, that these are not exhaustive extracts because time does not permit me that luxury-that the Commission is far from simply covering the same ground covered by coronial inquiries. It is in fact revealing the most disturbing deficiencies in the coronial system across Australia. No doubt the commission will report and recommend on it. I might add-it is probably appropriate at this point to say this-that the report which is currently being considered by the Commission from Perth. Perth coroner David McCann is also extremely disturbing and the widespread criticisms that McCann makes of coronial processes in Western Australia. Among other things-I was very interested to read this-David McCann canvasses the issue of police officers in Western Australia refusing to give evidence on the deaths of people in their own custody on the grounds that they may incriminate themselves. David McCann raises the very interesting question whether police officers who refuse to give evidence on the deaths of citizens who they take into their custody, on the grounds that they may incriminate themselves, should still be serving as police officers. That is a very valid question to put. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism has been made of the inquiry also as to the necessity to investigate the underlying issues involved and not simply to report on the deaths. I can assure you, Mr President, that this has been done very thoroughly indeed. There is one report so far published that I single out. If honourable senators do not have time to read all of the reports but if they have an interest in this subject, I commend to them a reading of the report into the death of Malcolm Charles Smith that has been presented by Commissioner Wootten. I will quote from page 73 of Commissioner Wootten's report. To background honourable senators briefly on this death, I mention that Malcolm Charles Smith was a New South Wales Aboriginal person who had been taken at the age of eight from his parents by the State in a manner tragically similar to that of so many cases across Australia. He was taken deliberately from his parents by the State as a result of a deliberate-I emphasise `deliberate'-public policy laid down by politicians of the day to eliminate the Aboriginal race in Australia and, in fact, to breed them out by taking part-Aboriginal children away from the `dying race', as Aboriginals were seen, and completely restricting their access to their own Aboriginal family until after 16 generations. I think that was the hypothesis at the time. Aboriginality would be bred out in that time. I add that crucial to that system was the practice that, when children were taken away from their parents, they were removed hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of kilometres away from their families. Malcolm Charles Smith did not see a single member of his family for some 10 years. He was in fact told at one stage-quite falsely-by the officers who were looking after him that his parents had died. </PARA>
<PARA> In commenting on this Commissioner Wootten said, on page 73:</PARA>
<PARA>This report has dealt with the taking away of Malcolm Smith from his family and its catastrophic effect on his life and ultimately his death. But this was not some isolated incident. Peter Read has calculated that 5,625 Aboriginal children were taken away from their families in New South Wales up to 1969 under the Aborigines Protection Act, the Aborigines Welfare Act and the Child Welfare Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the Aboriginal Welfare Board which was responsible for oversighting this was not abolished in New South Wales and this practice did not cease until 1969. Commissioner Wootten goes on to say at page 76, and it is worth reading:</PARA>
<PARA>After World War II there was drafted an international Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide which codified principles developed in the Nuremberg trials. The convention did not come into force until 1961, although Australia had become a party to it in 1949. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to quote from the Convention defining what genocide is. I will not read out all the parts, but the last parts are:</PARA>
<PARA>(3) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, (4) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group, (5) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore not emotive but simply a statement of fact to say that up until 1969 in this country politicians were bringing down policies, passing laws and oversighting a system that was clearly genocide under international conventions on the subject of genocide. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I will quote from page 7 of Commissioner Wootten's report, which again addresses the question of the investigation that Commissioner Wootten has undertaken in the most commendable manner about the underlying factors involving the death of this one individual and the sad and tragic case that the reading of this report reveals. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> In Part Three I seek to identify for further study, from evidence and information gained in the Malcolm Smith inquiry, issues underlying the occurrance of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Such issues are inevitably wide ranging. So long as Aboriginals are being detained and imprisoned at ten to twenty times the rate of non-Aboriginals, many will die in custody. So long as Aboriginals live in depressed communities without equal opportunities and hope for the future, so long as they remain an alienated, dispossessed people embittered by wrongs that have not been recognised or redressed, they will continue to come in conflict with the law and be taken into custody. So long as Aboriginals outside custody are dying twenty years and more earlier than non-Aboriginals, as the result of a high incidence of life style diseases, and of the alcoholism and violence which the stresses and frustrations of their lives produce, many will inevitably die in custody as well. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said on a number of occasions in the past, those people who say to us that we should not feel guilty about the injustices done to Aboriginal people 200 years ago are absolutely correct in my view. I do not believe that we should either. I think that it is a fruitless exercise to feel guilty about what was done to Aboriginal people 200 years ago. One of the other reasons that I feel we should not feel guilty about what was done to Aboriginal people 200 years ago is that there is really not very much room left after we feel guilty about what is being done to Aboriginal people right now in this country and in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that when Malcolm Charles Smith died he was younger than I was. I point out again to honourable senators in this House that the laws and policies which governed the forcible removal of Aboriginal children as a race from their parents were repealed in the State of New South Wales only in 1969, that is barely 20 years ago. So we are living with the generations of those children, now adults, of our own age today. So we really do not have a lot of time or energy to expend on feeling guilty about what was done 200 years ago. We should be flat out trying to redress the legacy that we have been left with today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is performing an essential and important role. It has already brought down a range of important recommendations which, if they are not implemented, will not be the fault of the Commission; it will be the fault of the politicians of this country whose forebears have given us the appalling legacy we now have because of recent past and present policies. The Commission has already exposed serious deficiencies in the entire process of post-death investigations in the coronial system of this country which will doubtless lead to important recommendations for the major reform in this area which is clearly long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> If reports of the quality of the one that I have just quoted, that from Commissioner Wootten still continue to be produced, the major underlying issues contributing to the appallingly high imprisonment rate of Australia's Aboriginal people will continue to be exposed. The total body of reports of the Commission, including its final report, as uncomfortable and as embarrassing as they will be to many people, will benefit all citizens of this country taken into custody-not just Aboriginals, but all citizens-and as a consequence will benefit the entire nation. The Commission should therefore receive, in my view, all of the assistance required to complete its important work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of the last couple of weeks the Senate has had a number of debates about the Antarctic. On a number of occasions I have drawn attention to two particular oil spills which are alleged to have taken place in the Antarctic. I have referred to both an accident involving an Argentinean vessel and an accident involving a Peruvian vessel. The Argentinean vessel in question, the Bahia Paraiso, in fact sank in the Antarctic with a resultant oil spill which was damaging to the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My attention was drawn to an article in the Australian newspaper of 1 March 1989 which starts off with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> A Peruvian research ship that ran aground in the Antarctic is leaking oil, posing the second ecological threat to the continent's wildlife in less than a month. </PARA>
<PARA> A Chilean navy spokesman said last night there was a 130m-wide slick floating towards the coast. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the 1980-tonne Humboldt's fuel tanks were punctured when it hit a rock off King George Island in the South Shetlands. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last month an Argentinian navy supply ship carrying 950,000 l of diesel fuel ran aground. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise only very briefly because today I was called upon by His Excellency Mr Gonzalo Bedoya, the Ambassador of Peru, who asked me to make a correction to the press report. The Ambassador advised me that the Peruvian ship, the BIC Humboldt ran aground while it was leaving Fildes Bay in the Antarctic. He advised me that according to the official information from the Peruvian Navy the BIC Humboldt at that time was laying on its centre port side on a flat bed of rock and was in no danger of sinking. He also indicated that the report from the Peruvian Navy claimed that the engine room was operative, the ship had electric energy and the water pumps were ready to be used in case that became necessary. The ship's keel apparently had not been punctured or pierced in any way, no sea water had entered the interior of the ship and also the fuel tanks had not been damaged nor fuel from them leaked outside the ship. He said that this report had been confirmed by Chilean scuba divers who had also verified that the wheel and propeller of the ship were in good condition. His Excellency indicated that as a result, Peruvian authorities were satisfied that no real ecological danger existed from this particular incident and that only small filtration had come from waste exhaust of the ship and that was subject to immediate control. His Excellency the Ambassador of Peru therefore asked me simply to place on the record the claim of the Peruvian Government, which I have no reason to take other than on its face value, that the Peruvian Government believed that there were a number of exaggerated reports arising from this particular incident involving the vessel the BIC Humboldt. After being beached for a week, the vessel was able to navigate by its own means and returned to Cove Porter and thence to Punta Arenas in Chile. Finally, it was confirmed, when the vessel returned, that the fuel tanks had been undamaged and that no pollution had occurred from this particular vessel. As I believe that the Ambassador of Peru is more than entitled to ask for a formal correction of the record in relation to what appears to have been an erroneous report in newspapers, and as that was a matter of substance raised in the debate, I thought it was entirely proper to make that explanation to the Senate and to put those facts on the record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight fairly briefly about the Uranium Review Committee which is under way within the Australian Labor Party at the moment. I am prompted to do so by a visit I made to the Pilbara this weekend to attend a bush meeting at Yule Brook where I met with the representatives of many Aboriginal groups. I went there at the invitation of the Pilbara community to speak particularly in a debate at the bush meeting on the question of uranium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graham Campbell, was also in attendance at the meeting. He did not seem to understand that that was the agenda item for the morning and he quite deliberately tried to railroad the meeting to talk about all sorts of other issues which were of course important to Aboriginal people. His performance was less than acceptable to the Aboriginal people and really quite embarrassing for a Federal parliamentarian. He got very angry and stormed out of the meeting. He was asked by the Chairperson of the meeting to come back and was told to sit down and listen to the views of the Aboriginal people. Two members of the State branch of the Australian Labor Party were also in attendance at the meeting. I think that they too were quite embarrassed by their colleague's behaviour. Pam Buchannan and Larry Graham were there. They spoke in very supportive terms about Aboriginal people and the need to listen to Aboriginal people. They also stated quite clearly their own personal opposition to the Labor Party in Western Australia changing its position on uranium mining. Obviously, this is something of great concern to the Aboriginal people in the Pilbara. </PARA>
<PARA> The members failed to mention the review committee which is at present under way in the Labor Party. I found it quite surprising that they did not give the people there the information that they needed to make any submission to the inquiry. They did not even mention it at all. Of course, I mentioned it and suggested that if the community had strong views about uranium it should certainly be making a submission to the inquiry. It made me look further at the process of the inquiry. What I found was quite disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, the inquiry is a quick tour around the capital cities of Australia. I think seven different cities are on the agenda of this eight-person committee. But people who wish to make submissions have had only two weeks' notice and it seems to have been kept almost a secret. I do not know how much advertising the Labor Party has done within its own circles, because I am not privy to that information, but certainly as far as the public are concerned there has been very little information available. I suppose that that is a deliberate silence on the part of the Party. It does not want to be embarrassed by an overwhelming anti-uranium response, which will begin to happen as soon as people hear about the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Pilbara there are two of the three likely uranium mines which are ready to go ahead in Western Australia. There is the one at Rudall River, where Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd has done all of its exploration and is ready to go as soon as there is either a change in policy or a change in government. The people there are opposed to mining, or to the disturbance of their land which also happens to be within a national park. They do not want uranium mining to go ahead under any circumstances. They have not been given an opportunity to present themselves before this Committee unless they are prepared to go to the expense of travelling at very short notice to Perth to do so. Of course, Menyingee, near Onslow, is another mining site which has been explored by a French mining company called Total, and is ready to go. Again, that is in the Pilbara region which is in the area where this meeting was held last weekend. I think it is really very unfair that the people in the region have not had some special time set aside so that they could make submissions to this inquiry. They could at least be given more notice and some assistance to get to Perth if that is the only place in Western Australia to which the Committee can go. Preferably, of course, the Committee should go up and sit under the trees and listen to the voices of the Aboriginal people. The third mine site, which is all ready to go in Western Australia, is at Yeelirrie, which is near Kalgoorlie and that is under the auspices of the Western Mining Co. There is no hearing in the goldfields region. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been only a few hours set aside for the public to make submissions to this inquiry which is going around the country very quickly. Many people therefore feel that there is an air of inaccessability about the inquiry which is very limiting indeed. I wonder how much information has been given to people in the Party. There is also time set aside for people within the Party. Overall, it is a very, very short amount of time. I understand that the members of the committee were told fairly early that they would be presenting their report in November or December to the Federal Executive. It is therefore a puzzle as to why they have to rush around the country now in the space of only one month, without giving the people who wish to make submissions adequate time to put those submissions together. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the question of the attendance of the members of the Committee at the two hearings which have taken place so far in Brisbane and Sydney over the last couple of weekends. Two of the members of Parliament who are members of the Committee have been in attendance at both of those meetings. They are Jeanette McHugh and Peter Milton, and Robert Mills from South Australia. However, as far as the other members of the Committee are concerned, there has not been consistent attendance. Senator Bob Collins has not attended either of the hearings, and Mr David Parker, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia has not attended either of the hearings. Senator Collins did not even bother to arrange a proxy to hear the points of view of people this weekend at the Sydney hearings. I think that that is a very poor showing indeed. I understand that it was very difficult for Senator Collins to get to the Sydney hearings because of other commitments in the Northern Territory, but there should have been better consultation by Mr Ian Henderson, who is organising this inquiry on behalf of the Labor Party, to ensure that the members of the Committee could at least attend the hearings, so that they could pick up the flavour of the submissions being presented. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are some people on that Committee who are there to listen very supportively to what is coming forward despite the lack of notice and despite the lack of consultation from the people who are making submissions and whose views are overwhelmingly in the anti-uranium direction. I think it is very important for people in the community to understand that written submissions can be made even after the committee has visited their particular State on its whistle stop tour. I think it is also very important to remind members of the Committee, and of the Labor Party in general, that public opinion in Australia is further and further against uranium mining. Overseas public opinion is further and further against nuclear power. It is not an option on moral grounds, on environmental grounds, and certainly not on economic grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the people in the Labor Party who are pushing this barrow, consistently as they have since 1982, need to be reminded-and I will be reminding the people at the hearings in Perth in a couple of weeks' time-that this is still a very important issue in the electorate and that the Labor Party will be making a grave mistake as people are quite reasonably surmising that the decision has already been made and that this Committee is merely a whitewash. I think it would be a great shame if the Labor Party made the mistake of pushing its uranium policy further and further into the direction of mining. The three mines policy is, of course, totally illogical. Either one is for uranium mining, with all its consequent difficulties, or one is opposed to uranium mining. That is the preferred position of well over half the Australian population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday of this week I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, whether or not he or his Department has taken any action in response to alleged requests by Senator Graham Richardson to terminate the employment of a former research assistant and speech writer to the Australian Ambassador in Washington, a Mr Michael Davis. The Minister replied at that stage that he had no knowledge of Mr Michael Davis, but yesterday he replied in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department has told me that Mr Michael Davis commenced employment with the Embassy in Washington in the locally engaged staff position of research officer to the Ambassador on 25 October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It has no record of any request or requests by Senator Graham Richardson to terminate the employment of Mr Davis. Senator Richardson has assured me-and he is an honourable man-that he made no such request. The services of Mr Davis were not terminated by the Embassy but he submitted his resignation on 21 February 1989 and left the employment of the Embassy on 29 March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer given by the Minister is somewhat at odds with information that has come into my possession by way of a fax which was sent by Mr Michael Davis from the Australian Embassy on 16 March 1989 on Embassy of Australia, Washington, DC, letterhead, wherein Mr Davis said that on Wednesday, 8 February 1989 the Deputy Head of Mission, Mr Max Hughes, had told him that he would have to finish up at the Embassy by the end of March 1989. Mr Davis was told that no other job at the Embassy or any of the Australian Consulates-General was available to him. The reason given was that the new Ambassador would want a new speech writer whose style was different from that of Mr Davis. Mr Davis was given to understand that his dismissal was due to inadequacy of work performance, however no indication of this was given at any stage between 26 October and 8 February. The fax continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The real reason is that Senator Graham Richardson, in pursuing an internal ALP struggle associated with the Kingsford-Smith preselection, has prevailed upon senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to effect the dismissal of Mr Davis because he is in support of the candidacy of Mr Ron Hoenig, Mayor of Botany, against Mr Laurie Brereton, the member for Heffron. </PARA>
<PARA> The officers in the Embassy with whom I have dealt on this matter, Mr Max Hughes and Mr Bill Rowe, the Consul-General, have been decent about this. They can tell the name of the Canberra official who gave their instruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peter Fitzgerald, the Mayor of Drummoyne, was told by Senator Richardson personally, `. . . and as for Davis, I'll get him'. Mr Fitzgerald, a support of Mayor Hoenig, was discussing with Senator Richardson the inappropriateness of Laurie Brereton as a Federal Labor candidate at the time of the threat. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Davis then arrived back in Sydney. The concern I have is that the Minister has stated that Mr Davis did not have his employment terminated, but in fact resigned. The dates are relevant. Mr Davis asserts in his written statement, which is signed by him, that he was told on 8 February that he would have to finish up, that there was no more work for him. The Minister says that he allegedly resigned on 21 February, yet Mr Davis faxed this statement to Australia from Washington on 16 March. The dates very simply do not add up. If the situation is that either there is no letter of resignation or the letter of resignation was coerced and Mr Davis was, in fact, sacked, the Minister has indeed misled the Parliament. The determination of the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales to see Mr Laurie Brereton come into the Parliament and have Mr Hoenig defeated on Saturday next, 6 May, may have meant that the Department has been used as part of a faction fight, which is quite unacceptable. The matter is very serious. I have chosen to raise it in the adjournment debate tonight because I feel it is in the public interest that the matter be aired before the preselection is held on Saturday next, 6 May. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the father of Kanak independence, leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) was assassinated this evening in New Caledonia.This is a tragedy of extraordinary proportions for the Kanak people and the future of peace and stability in New Caledonia. As I said, from the early 1970s Jean-Marie Tjibaou was the founder and leader of the Kanak demands for independence. He was an outstanding figure. I had the good fortune to meet him on at least two occasions. I met him only a week ago on Monday in New Caledonia when I was the leader of a parliamentary delegation from Australia, of which Senator Hill was also a member. In more than an hour's discussion, he again emphasised to me that he was a man who could be considered in any country of the world an outstanding political leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember a particular point of our meeting. I asked a question about some particular matter of the Matignon Accord. That is the Accord signed by the French Government, the FLNKS and the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR). The RPCR is associated with the French settlers in New Caledonia. Those three groups signed the accord for a 10-year program leading to an act of self-determination in 1988. When I asked the question about some aspect of the Matignon Accord, Jean-Marie Tjibaou went to his briefcase, pulled out the document and described it as `the Bible'. He was obviously proud of his very significant association with and involvement in bringing about the Accord. The information that has come through from New Caledonia this evening is still sketchy. It may be very unfortunate that he was assassinated by militants in the FLNKS who disagreed with the signing of the Matignon Accord. The very same accord that he called `the Bible' may well have been the reason that some mad men or women went about his assassination. </PARA>
<PARA> Jean-Marie Tjibaou met many people in Australia and came to Australia on a number of occasions. All those who met him were impressed by his sincerity, intelligence, warmth and humanity. I first met him in 1983 and at that stage also met Eloi Machoro, another FLNKS leader who was shot dead in 1986. For those of us who have supported Kanak independence, it becomes a sorry tale to realise that the people we meet, feel warm towards and support, pay with their lives for the fact that they want to support independence for their country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Matignon Accord was an historic breakthrough in the history of New Caledonia in that it provided a peaceful way to resolve the matters in dispute between the Kanaks and the French settlers, called caldoches, and the French Government. When we were there only last week, we were all impressed by the fact that the country seemed peaceful and tranquil and that although there were still differences of opinion between the FLNKS and the RPCR, by comparison with what was occurring only a matter of a year or so ago we had great optimism that the process would lead to a successful conclusion. I hoped it would lead to New Caledonia being independent. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I have had an interest in foreign affairs matters, I have always been irked by the fact that it is often the so-called good guys who get killed or assassinated. Those who have worked for independence, democracy, liberty, and human rights always seem to be the first to suffer the ultimate consequence of violence, particularly those who have fought for independence for their country. We all know the story of Mahatma Gandhi, the leader for Indian independence, assassinated by a fanatic just as India received independence. We all know the story of Steve Biko, a leading South African student who argued for the end of apartheid and human rights and full democracy for all the people of South Africa. He died in South African police custody. </PARA>
<PARA> I also know of the case, which is not well known in Australia-I certainly was not aware of it until my visit to Burma in February this year-of General Aung Saan, the founder of Burmese independence, who was assassinated just as Burma gained independence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the dreadful tragedy of Jean-Marie Tjibaou, who was assassinated this evening as New Caledonia was moving forward with great hope for the future. I should also mention that a message has just come through that his deputy, Yeweine Yeweine, has also died as a result of the attack tonight. Someone else was wounded, but the two main leaders of the FLNKS were killed on the island of Ouvea while attending ceremonies in memory of those who died 12 months ago tomorrow on that island during disturbances. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report that has come in tonight concerning Tjibaou's assassination, it is said that, during the ceremony, Jean-Marie Tjibaou paid tribute not only to dead Kanaks but also to the others who died-obviously the French gendarmes. One can again see the statesmanship of Jean-Marie Tjibaou in that he was attempting to show a reconciliation between the various groups in New Caledonia by making those remarks. My only hope is that those remarks were not further encouragement to the fanatics who killed him as he was attempting a reconciliation by mourning loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that tomorrow not only New Caledonia but much of the South Pacific will be in mourning because one of its most significant political leaders is dead. I believe that the French Government will be extraordinarily distressed by Tjibaou's assassination because France recognised his extraordinary qualities to which Premier Rocard paid tribute during the process of the Matignon Accord. I trust that, when more information comes through, the Australian Parliament will pay proper tribute to the work done by Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeweine Yeweine. </PARA>
<PARA> The point should be made that a country close to Australia has had political assassinations. This further emphasises the point that Australia is in a region-the South Pacific-that can no longer be considered to be totally placid. There are stresses and strains. The democracy we take for granted and the tolerance we have in our society despite our political differences, unfortunately do not exist in the way we would hope they would in other countries in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the parliamentary disputes that we have in this chamber and in this Parliament really pale into insignificance when someone like Jean-Marie Tjibaou is assassinated. The arguments that we have over such things as preselections, elections to parliamentary caucus and so on are really minuscule when compared with people in other parts of the world paying with their lives for arguing for those same rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the obvious extraordinary stress and strain that will occur in New Caledonia over the next few days, I hope that peace and stability in that country can be maintained. I am sure that the Australian Government and the Australian Opposition parties will express strong support and do all that they can to encourage all the parties in New Caledonia to remain peaceful and not to start a cycle of retribution resulting in further bloodshed. It would be a final tribute to Jean-Marine Tjibaou if no more people die in a cycle of vengeance because of these dreadful assassinations tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government will send suitable representatives to his funeral whenever it is held. I would certainly like to be involved. That may not be possible but I certainly hope that the Government and the Opposition parties are properly represented at his funeral.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that, personally, this is a terrible shock. I know that Senator Hill, who was a member of the delegation, will speak next. He met Jean-Marie Tjibaou. He went to New Caledonia and he has taken an interest in that country. Like me, he is terribly shocked and disappointed at what has happened. One despairs when a person like Jean-Marie Tjibaou, who has given so much to his country, is assassinated by a lunatic at a time when progress is being made to achieve the goal he had set himself. I hope that, at an appropriate time, the Senate will carry a resolution recognising his great contribution to Kanak independence and the people of the South Pacific. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated by Senator Schacht, I take this opportunity to say a few words on the same subject. This is a day of great sadness for all of us who are interested in peace and stability within the South Pacific in general and New Caledonia in particular. As I indicated, I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words in tribute to Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeweine Yeweine, the vice-president of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) who, we have just heard, also died in the attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tragedy has never been far from Jean-marie Tjibaou. Because you knew him also and admired his work, Mr President, you would recall that he suffered a personal tragedy in 1984 during the FLNKS campaign following its boycott of the November territial assembly elections when settlers ambused a group of 14 FLNKS supporters near his home town, killing 10 from his tribe, including two of his brothers. </PARA>
<PARA> The assassination today took place on the eve of the first anniversary of the death of 19 Melanesians on the island of Ouvea who were killed on 5 May last year. Jean-Marie Tjibaou and his deputy were on the island today to commemorate their deaths. When we were in New Caledonia only a week ago, a ceremony took place to mark the deaths of the four gendarmes who were killed on Ouvea a few days before the death of the Melanesians. So it is a sad picture of violence and death. This is a very depressing day for all of us who had become so much more hopeful for the future of New Caledonia. </PARA>
<PARA> I met Jean-Marie Tjibaou in Australia, and then at the United Nations in 1986. At that time the two parliamentary advisers, Senator Bolkus and I, were working for the reinscription of New Caledonia on the list of colonised countries of the world, and Jean-Marie Tjibaou was in New York quite often, working towards the same objective. I got to know him a little during that time. I had met him previously in Australia and I remember that we jointly participated in a conference on the South Pacific in Washington in 1986. It was good to see him again in New Caledonia a week ago. He showed the same optimism and sense of humour which I will always remember. Certainly he seemed pleased to see me again, as he would be pleased to see anyone who had any interest in the future well-being of his country. </PARA>
<PARA> I went to New Caledonia for the referendum in September 1987. That was a vote on whether or not New Caledonia wished to remain with France. I came back deeply concerned about the future of New Caledonia. The atmosphere was stressful and, objectively, one could really have little optimism for the future. As Senator Schacht mentioned, I went back last week for a couple of days with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of this Parliament because I was interested to see for myself whether the changes of which I had read and seen in the media were valid; in other words, whether there had been a significant change of attitude. I came back extremely heartened and hopeful. </PARA>
<PARA> I was amazed at the changes that had occurred in such a short period of some 18 months. I know that in part those changes related to the change of government in France and different attitudes from France, but probably some credit should be given to a lot of people. Certainly more than a fair share of the credit should be given to Jean-Marie Tjibaou himself because he had to lead the Kanak people in a new direction. That meant taking a slower path towards independence that required fairly dramatic steps and, in the meantime, a year of direct rule from France, the experiment with the provincial elections and a series of new events for the Kanak people. He was able to show them that leadership. He and the Opposition party in New Caledonia jointly pledged in Paris that they would work together under the Matignon Accords towards a new future for New Caledonia, a future of trust in each other, working towards an ultimate referendum on the subject of independence in a decade's time. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to the major political parties, the leaders of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the Caldoche and the French, one could not but come away with a feeling that New Caledonia had turned the corner and the future looked extremely hopeful. I particularly stress the French because I can remember meeting the High Commissioner there with his aides 18 months ago, and on that occasion meeting a High Commissioner whose attitude was that we must work with the Kanak people towards our mutual well-being. That reflected the changes that I said I thought it was incredible could have occurred within such a short period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> This must not be a victory for extremists. I am sure that it would be the one wish of Jean-Marie Tjiboau, if he had no other, that the path of peace must continue and the Melanesian people must continue to work with the French towards a solution of the problems in New Caledonia that will provide peace, stability, security and increased economic well-being for all of the people of that country. I hope we have an opportunity at some time to pay respect on a more considered basis to the memory of Jean-Marie Tjibaou, but I briefly wanted tonight to associate myself and the Opposition with the comments made by Senator Schacht, who was speaking both personally and on behalf of the Government. This is a sad day for the Pacific but it must not be a wasted day. The life of Jean-Marie Tjibaou must not be wasted. All of us, and there are plenty of us in this place, who want to do our bit to help peace and stability in the Pacific must resolve to work even harder towards that objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! It is not usual for the President of the Senate to take part in a debate. This is the first time I have done so, and I will be very brief. I first met Jean-Marie Tjibaou in 1978 at the South Pacific Conference held in Noumea, when I was one of the parliamentary observers from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. At that stage we had to meet in what I can only describe as a clandestine manner. The meeting was organised by the Australian High Commission. Things had changed quite dramatically by 1983 when I led the Australian delegation to the South Pacific Conference in Saipan. I think you, Senator Hill, were a member of that delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was able to spend a great deal of time with Jean-Marie Tjibaou because I think he was a member of the official delegation from New Caledonia. In fact, he might have been the leader. We were able to discuss at great length the problems of the independence movement. He was dedicated to the ideals and aspirations of the Kanak people and to the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front. There are already rumours that he was assassinated by members of his own organisation. If that is true it is a worse tragedy than I first thought. I am appalled by the news and can only support the views that were put forward tonight by Senator Schacht and Senator Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight Senator Bishop continued with her line of attack on me concerning the employment of a Mr Michael Davis as a locally engaged staff member of the Australian Embassy in Washington. I quite rightly ignored her first attempt but, given that she has made a second, I believe it is proper that I reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the period of almost two years that Senator Bishop has been here in the Senate there are four things by which she can be remembered. The first and, I think, the extraordinary thing by which she can be remembered is that she is the only senator, so far as I am aware, ever able to employ a professional public relations consultant to publicise her career. She has a consultant to make sure that there are photographs-no matter how unsightly we may find them-of her in football jumpers in magazines; to make sure that there are mentions of her in gossip columns; and to make sure that, generally speaking, we know she is alive. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, she will be remembered as the person who defeated Senator Puplick in a Liberal Party preselection ballot. That was some achievement. Senator Puplick had previously enjoyed a reputation as something of a numbers man. I do not quite understand what all that means, but my impression was that he had been good at what he did. But Senator Puplick was defeated by Senator Bishop, and a professional public relations consultant was employed by her. It was obvious that within the Liberal Party money and power could override ability. </PARA>
<PARA> While Senator Puplick has been strangely silent on the environment for the past two years, I can at least say that I remember some contributions he has made in the Senate. While I may have passionately disagreed with him at the time, I can say that the contributions that he made on Lionel Murphy and on the Australia Card I at least remember. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop, however, can be remembered in this chamber for the third and fourth things to which I shall refer. Both of them, of course, are not only tinged but dominated by failure. The third was her remarks in the Castlereagh by-election-a rather pathetic attempt to involve the Labor Party in electoral fraud. Disowned, of course, by her own Party in New South Wales, her Liberal Government in New South Wales, those allegations died a natural death. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing for which she will be remembered after two years in the Australian Senate concerns the latest failure. I refer to some allegations by Mr Michael Davis. The allegation that Senator Bishop has pursued is that I asked someone somewhere to sack Mr Michael Davis from a position he occupied in the Australian Embassy in Washington. The first thing I should say about that, to place it on record, is that I never asked directly, or suggested indirectly, to anyone in the Australian Embassy in Washington, or in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Australia, that he should assist in the sacking of Mr Michael Davis. If there is anything more spectacularly irrelevant to the job that I do or to the Australian Senate than the employment of a Mr Michael Davis, I cannot recall just what it might be. However, I repeat the assurance: I have never suggested to anyone that Mr Michael Davis should be sacked. I never knew that he had been employed until I arrived in Washington in December, and certainly there could be few things that could alarm me less than that employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, Mr Davis-a person who purports to be a supporter of the Labor Party, who seeks a vote in a Labor Party preselection-chooses to use the vehicle of an extreme right wing Liberal senator as his redress in the Australian Parliament. I will allow the membership of the Party in Kingsford-Smith to make its own judgment as to why the only person who could raise his cause, for better or for worse, in the Australian Parliament would be an extreme right wing figure of the kind of Senator Bishop. Nonetheless, on Saturday, in the electorate of Kingsford-Smith, the Labor Party's rank and file will make its judgment. I suspect that when that judgment is made, it will be far more inclined to my beliefs than to those of Senator Bishop. </PARA>
<PARA> In making that judgment, I am reminded of an article-or of a portion of an article-which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald a few weeks ago, upon Mr Davis's return to Australia. I may say that that event remained unheralded in all publications in the country, except for the `Stay in Touch' column of the Sydney Morning Herald. In that column over the past month I have seen a number of stories which have sought to denigrate Laurie Brereton, a member of the New South Wales Parliament, in his campaign for preselection for the Federal seat of Kingsford-Smith. Apparently, a Mr Kennedy is the editor of that column. He, I am told, is a close friend of Mr Davis, in the same way that Senator Bishop obviously is now. Mr Kennedy will have the same effect on the Labor Party's preselection processes as Senator Bishop. Every day Mr Kennedy has produced a horror story-or so he thought-about the Kingsford-Smith preselection. Every day, Mr Davis's line, his obsessive opposition to Mr Brereton, has received a run. The first that I knew either that Mr Davis had been sacked or that someone like me might be accused of organising that dismissal was from that column, where it was alleged that Mr Davis, in his courageous, crusader-like return from the United States, was to sue this prominent member of the Labor Party who had organised his dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently, it is now revealed, by no less a source than the extreme right wing senator from the Liberal Party, Senator Bishop, that I am that person. It surprises me that, in the month that has passed since this breathless allegation received its publicity in the Sydney Morning Herald, I have not been sued. I might say that I would welcome that suit. I challenge Mr Davis-no one cares about Senator Bishop-to produce evidence that I ever spoke to anyone and suggested that he should be sacked. Inquiries that I have made since suggest, by the way, that to get the job in the first place he used a reference that I had provided to him. You see, Mr President, I have known Mr Davis for many years. I did provide him with a reference to get a job. Admittedly, it was a job in the State Public Service and this was some years ago. Apparently that same reference was trotted out when he sought employment at the Australian Embassy in Washington and that was done unbeknown to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that. I am glad that the honourable senator has raised that, because I would expect him to be on the side of Senator Bishop. He would need to be if he wanted any future at all. Going back to the reference that was produced by Mr Davis, it is interesting that he actually failed to get around to telling me that he was re-using, re-cycling-that is a word that has received a bit of publicity in recent days-for a job in the Australian Embassy a reference that I had given him for a job in the State Public Service some years previously. Nonetheless, let me point out to interested senators that I am quite happy that he should do so. I do not mind at all his using that reference. Even today, I would be happy to write another one because, as a speech writer, Mr Davis would be a sensation. He has made some great speeches. He has, as they say, the gift of the gab. Having said that, I wonder just where Senator Bishop has her role in this particular saga. Senator Puplick, quite rightly, has raised the spectre of Mr Domican. I am glad that he has. Mr Davis takes up a rightful place, along with Mr Domican and with a Virginia Perger, in making allegations against me, allegations that I have refuted in this place. The previous two allegations that I have refuted in this place are now so discredited as to be followed up by no-one. I only wish that someone would follow them up. Senator Bishop is a very powerful person in the Liberal Party. I hope that she can deliver on that. I would love to have the opportunity to defend myself in other fora, but now we have Mr Davis added to Virginia Perger. They make a very interesting pair. Their credibility ranks equal. The result of the allegations will rank even more equal, but you, Senator Bishop-you are just rank.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issues that have been raised very rightly tonight by Senator Bishop reflect on a question asked of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on 3 May. In the answer that Senator Evans gave on that day he made this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department has told me that Mr Michael Davis commenced employment with the Embassy in Washington in the locally engaged staff position of research officer to the Ambassador on 25 October 1988. It has no record of any request or requests by Senator Graham Richardson to terminate the employment of Mr Davis. Senator Richardson has assured me-and he is an honourable man-that he made no such request. </PARA>
<PARA>The document from which Senator Bishop quoted today gives a different account and names officers of the Embassy. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The officers of the Embassy with whom I have dealt on this matter, Mr Max Hughes and Mr Bill Rowe, Consul-General, have been decent about this. They can tell the name of the Canberra official who gave them their instruction. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a most serious allegation and it is one that should be pursued. Of course, it is strangely coincidental that Senator Richardson was in Washington in December. He has said that he calls into question the credibility of Mr Davis who signed the facts from which Senator Bishop has quoted. But, of course, he is also, therefore, impugning the credibility of Mayor Fitzgerald of Drummoyne and Mayor Hoenig from a municipality within the Kingsford-Smith electorate. These are serious matters that I think should be taken into account and, no doubt, they will require further investigation. I seek leave of the Senate to table the documents and the facsimile from which Senator Bishop quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In winding up this long adjournment debate at this very late hour tonight the only matter I want to refer to is the tragic assassination earlier this evening of Jean-Marie Tjibaou and his colleague Mr Yeweine Yeweine, the second most senior member of the Kanak independence movement in New Caledonia. The news is tragic indeed. I am distressed about it. I know that that distress is shared not only by my colleagues in the Government but also by a great many members of parliament on both sides of both chambers, two of whom have spoken eloquently tonight-Senator Schacht from my Party and Senator Hill of the Liberal Party of Australia. I believe that all Australians will join right-minded New Caledonians in deploring this shocking act of violence and in paying tribute to two of the architects of the peaceful processes currently in place in New Caledonia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jean-Marie Tjibaou, in particular, was an inspiration to his people. He was one of the great apostles of moderation in New Caledonia's recent troubled history. I had the pleasure of meeting him personally on several occasions, most recently during my ministerial visit to New Caledonia last September when I, too, was heartened-as were other honourable senators who have spoken tonight-at the extraordinary progress that had been achieved in the territory and the extraordinary spirit of optimism and hope which was then abroad. Jean-Marie Tjibaou was a man of great capacity, great vision and great personal dignity. His leadership of the Kanak people, through the processes of the Matignon and Oudino accords gave hope for the first time that a way through the traumas of the territory could be found that would satisfy the aspirations of both black and white New Caledonians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very sad irony that, at a time when the future holds hope for a lasting, peaceful, multi-racial solution to the troubles of New Caledonia, one of the Pacific's really outstanding leaders should be cut down in this way. Mr President, you too have spoken movingly of this unhappy event tonight. We all simply hope that these tragic events will do nothing to interrupt the processes in place in New Caledonia, which processes will result in a democracy, in a form of government that is acceptable and satisfactory to all New Caledonians-a result which, hopefully, will be Jean-Marie Tjibaou's lasting monument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (4) There has been no change from the situation I detailed in my reply to Question on Notice No. 591 on 24 November 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Future management arrangements for the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area have already been the subject of three months public consultation between April and July 1988. This public consultation led to the development of a proposed collaborative Commonwealth-State management model which recognised the rights of all tiers of government as well as local interests. All that is required is for Queensland to accept the Commonwealth's continuing invitation to hold discussions on the details of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> To date the Queensland Government has declined to cooperate in the management of the Area and has challenged both the validity of the Proclamation (published in Special Gazette No. S387 on 15 December 1988) and the appropriateness of the regulations (Statutory Rules 1988 No. 389 of 16 December 1988) made under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. The Government does not propose to take any action to preclude the development of cooperative management arrangements while the legal action is in progress. In the meantime I will be setting up a Consultative Committee to advise me on management arrangements.</PARA>
