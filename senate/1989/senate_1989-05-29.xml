<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) they are gravely concerned over the availability of war toys and other combat or violence related toys and games, including video games, in our country;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) they believe there is sufficient scientific evidence to show that these kind of toys and games are educationally unsound, psychologically damaging to children, and socially undesirable.</PARA>

<PARA> (d) calls on the Government to explain to Australians, if it can, how the country's foreign debt could possibly have been increased by the application of Australian labour and Australian materials to the building of homes in Australia for Australian families, the vast majority of whom have no involvement in overseas trade, borrowing or currency speculation;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) dissociates itself from the apparent view of the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that Australia's international credit rating is a matter of greater concern than the hardships being experienced by Australian families under the pressure of unaffordable mortgage cost increases;</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) the report also points out that the Government has placed too much emphasis on acquiring the sophisticated equipment necessary to deter a high-level threat, at the expense of basic considerations of mobility, ground support and manpower levels necessary to maintain the capability to meet the much more likely event of a low-level incursion,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the RSL also points out the need to further develop a capability to project military power to counter other low-level operations in Australia's area of military and national interest, and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) in conclusion, the RSL warns the Government that the current level of Defence funding is not sufficient to meet its White Paper commitments, and that the Government must either increase funding to fulfil those commitments, re-arrange its priorities to meet more realistic contingencies or own up and admit that they cannot meet all their White Paper commitments and modify its policy accordingly; and</PARA>

<PARA> (b) supports the contention of the dead boy's parents that a Royal Commission should be held into the death, on the ground that there is no other procedure available in Western Australia through which all available witnesses can be heard and examined in pursuit of the truth in this case;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the devastating impact of record interest rates on Australian home buyers and the Treasurer's admission last week that at least part of the 1 July tax cuts will have to go towards helping to meet the extra burden. Taking one of the examples mentioned in the April economic statement, a wage earner on $26,000 a year and with a dependent spouse and two children, who has been promised tax and family assistance advantage of $41 a week, I ask whether the Minister is aware that if such a person has a $50,000 unregulated home loan over 25 years, his or her mortgage repayments have gone up, in less than a year, by about $34 a week, and in the case of a $75,000 mortgage-which is by no means excessive these days-the increase exceeds $50 a week. In other words, does the Minister agree that the crippling interest rates flowing from his Government's economic policy have, for hundreds of thousands of Australians, wiped out the benefits from the tax cuts before they have even been received?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2886" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even Senator Patterson's own figures do not establish that proposition; but of course the Government is aware of the impact of high interest rates on certain home owners. I have not done the figures to which Senator Patterson referred in her question; I am not in a position to either accept or dispute those figures. I accept them as having been put forward in good faith. The fact is that tax cuts given at any time are eroded in certain circumstances by inflation, or by mortgage repayments, or whatever. The tax cuts will, however, remain. It is the Government's hope that the high level of home loan mortgage rates will not remain.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Finance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the first question, it is, by definition, not possible to make savings on social security outlays without either affecting the eligibility-making changes which withdraw eligibility-or lowering the rate to some or all. A further danger is that if an attempt were made to do that by restricting eligibility to a particular entitlement, there would be a risk that people might transfer to some other entitlement. But it is not possible, by definition, to make savings unless we either withdraw the entitlement that some people have or reduce the rate that some or all receive. I was particularly interested in Dr Hewson's reference to tighter targeting, and to note the total contradiction between that and Mr Peacock's statement made in 1984 in his only election campaign as Leader of the Opposition when he proposed effectively to abolish targeting altogether and to provide, at least in the long term, universal entitlement. In 1984 he was promising to abolish the assets test. That test is currently saving $500m or $600m a year. Dr Hewson talks about tighter targeting. What does the Opposition stand for? Does it stand for no targeting or tighter targeting?</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask you, in giving your ruling, to indicate what that means if what the Minister was doing then was not debating the question. He had moved away from any direct answer to the question asked and was undertaking a general debate which included attacking the now Leader of the Opposition for his 1984 position. I suggest to you, Mr President, that if that standing order has any meaning at all, the Minister has infringed it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make two other points. The first-a legitimate point, I suppose-is that 1984 was a long time ago. Now that the souffle has risen again, perhaps it has also changed its view of the world. However, I refer those who are interested to the Opposition's social security policy issued towards the end of 1988 which still proposed a very substantial relaxation of the assets test which would have impeded the sort of structural adjustment that is required in agriculture as well. As to the final part of the question, the Government certainly will not be taking advice from merchant-banking, restaurant-owning, yuppie, Ferrari-driving shadow treasurers about who is needy and who is not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is apparently not aware that his Treasurer has gone to the Soviet Union. We are seeking details of the itinerary in the Soviet Union and estimates of the costs. I will now ask specific questions about the trip. Is it a fact that the visit to the Soviet Union was privately organised by the Treasurer's ministerial office and not by any Government department-not even by the Treasury? Can the Minister confirm-I believe it is the Minister's responsibility-that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade first learned of the Treasurer's Soviet visit from the Australian Embassy in Moscow, which has expressed its frustration and concern about the fact that the itinerary and arrangements were organised without its involvement? Can the Minister also confirm that, besides Moscow and Leningrad, the Treasurer will be visiting a number of other places in the Soviet Union which hold no direct relevance for any Australian Government business at all? Is it a fact that the common link between the Treasurer's various ports of call in the Soviet Union is their significance as trading centres for Empire period antiques?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I chose to take the question on notice was that at that stage I had no details of the itinerary that the Treasurer was following and only the most general knowledge of the purpose of his visit. That is not in the slightest bit unusual. Ministers are constantly travelling for good reason, just as they did during the Fraser era, the McMahon era, the Holt era and the Gorton era-on a significantly greater scale, incidentally, than is the case these days. There is no reason whatsoever why my Department or I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, should be expected to know off the top of my head what the circumstances are of a particular visit of a particular Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But as it turns out, since I have been given the courtesy of a supplementary question by Senator Lewis, I am now able to answer with some precision what the circumstances are. There is no need for me to take that part of the question on notice. The Treasurer is taking up a longstanding invitation from the Soviet Government to visit the Soviet Union. His time in Leningrad will be mainly over a weekend from late Friday, 2 June, until he departs for Moscow early on Tuesday, 6 June. He will be making official calls in that time. The arrangements are in the hands of the Soviet authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> In Moscow the Treasurer will address the Institute of International Relations on the international economy. He will meet members of that institute. He will meet with the committee on Soviet industry and economic reconstruction. Appointments have also been sought with the central committee of the Soviet Communist Party and a range of other Soviet representatives. Precise meetings will depend upon the appointment this week by the Supreme Soviet of the Prime Minister and Ministers of the Soviet Government. Of course the identification of appointees has been in issue pending that meeting of the Supreme Soviet this week.</PARA>
<PARA> May I conclude by saying that it is entirely appropriate that Australia should continue to develop high level links with the Soviet Union consistent with not only our foreign policy interests but also our national economic interests, and of course not least in order to keep before our eyes a detailed current understanding of the important changes which are occurring in Soviet policy. There is no question whatsoever of anything other than the most ample and substantial justification for the Treasurer's visit to the Soviet Union. As a result the question is totally misconceived.</PARA>

<PARA> In reply to the part of the question dealing with the particular assistance afforded to him by national law enforcement agencies, let me say that it is a fact that the National Crime Authority has, from the very beginning, partly because it had a reference which coincided in part with areas of inquiry that Mr Fitzgerald wished to follow, been of great assistance to Mr Fitzgerald. Mr Fitzgerald has called upon the Australian Federal Police and several members of it in particular to give him assistance in pursuing certain lines of inquiry and, indeed, in drawing up his report. Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have been extremely helpful at every stage and have responded to every request from Mr Fitzgerald during the course of his investigations which are so important to Queensland in relation to its own law enforcement agencies and the propriety of the conduct of both elected and non-elected public officials.</PARA>

The article was headed `Banks may not be villain on rates' and makes, among others, the following points: bank profits are not particularly high in Australia either compared with international banks or in relation to other Australian businesses; the six-monthly increases in profit of 52 per cent and 37 per cent for National Australia Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corporation respectively are `huge and meaningless numbers unless related to . . . the return each company earns for its shareholders'; and if it were possible for mortgage rates to be lower, would not government banks such as the State Bank of Victoria be making them lower? Does the Minister agree with the assessment made by Mr Short in that article? In particular, does the Minister believe that the responsibility for the current interest rate crisis lies more with the Government's economic policies than with the banks or does he believe that one or more external factor outside the control of either government or the banks is responsible?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the last part of the question concerning interest earnings, let me say that, whatever change should be made to the taxation treatment of interest payments, if the objective is to increase savings or change the mix between savings and consumption, one thing that the Government will not do is follow the crude, populist line or posturing of the likes of Senator Haines who brought in a private member's Bill to exempt the first $2,000 of income, because the effect of that, for the reasons I explained to her in some detail when her silly Bill was before the Senate, would be a reduced savings effort, that is, a big reduction in public savings for a possible small increase in private savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the rest of the question, I did not see the Age article. I was, however, aware of the fact that some banks-I think the two named by Senator Haines were the National Australia Bank and Westpac-had reported large percentage increases in their profits for this period compared to the previous period. I am not sure whether the previous period was a 12-month or a six-month period. Senator Haines said that those increased profits amounted to 52 per cent and 37 per cent respectively. I was asked whether they are meaningless. They are certainly not meaningless because, assuming the figures are correct, it means they are 52 per cent and 37 per cent respectively higher than for the previous period. If one looks beyond that, they are not particularly meaningful unless they are measured against the size of the investment, and I do not know what that is. As to the State Bank of Victoria, I would have thought that it would have enough trouble dealing with the fall-out from the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia without adding anything else to its plate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Put what in order? I will put Senator Boswell in order again with a bit of wire if he gives too much cheek. The Government is currently trying to legislate for the protection of the community rating principle by expanding the reinsurance pool to cover hospital costs, including supplementary benefits, from the time of admission to hospital for all people aged 65 and over. That will relieve the pressure on those funds which have a disproportionate number of older contributors. The Government believes that it is only fair that health funds should compete on a level playing field, that they should not be allowed to pick and choose their clients in such a way that required some funds to charge ever-increasing premiums while other funds charged ever decreasing premiums, if they were skilful enough at selecting their client group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is completely beyond me why the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have opposed that legislation. The point of Senator Faulkner's question concerns the effect that this will have on aged people. If the Opposition and the Democrats persist with their misconceived plans to block this legislation the premiums paid by aged people for health insurance will go up, to the point where a very much smaller number of them will be able to afford health insurance. All the significant age pensioner organisations are well aware of that fact. The Government has the support of, among other groups, the Australian Pensioners Federation, the Australian Council on the Ageing, the Australian Retired Persons Association and the Combined Pensioners Association of New South Wales. Even Grey Power-I think `geriatric fascists' was the term used by Senator Haines-is supporting this move.</PARA>
<PARA> The pensioners have seen what the consequences of this misconceived action would be. They are rightly dismayed and outraged about the action the Opposition and the Democrats propose to take. I am informed that the 8,000 pensioners in the seat of Kingston are already campaigning against Senator Haines on this issue. I predict that it will not be very long, once Senator Haines gets the message from the 8,000 pensioners in Kingston, before she backs down on it. If she is not too concerned about the pensioners of Kingston, I would have thought that she would pay some attention to the first paragraph in today's editorial in the major newspaper in her State-that, of course being the Adelaide Advertiser. Under the heading `Politics threatens care of the Aged', the article said:</PARA>
<PARA> The coalition Opposition and the Democrats will show today whether they care more for people or for playing politics. They have threatened to combine and delay legislation intended to reform health insurance by forcing it into a Senate committee.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the national accounts, there are significant variations, in the proportion of income derived from pensions, benefits and related payments, between the national average and the figures for a number of States. In the last financial year, some 13 per cent of total household income, nationally, came from transfer payments, principally pensions but also unemployment benefit and a few other payments, whereas in Queensland almost 15 per cent of household income came from that source-a matter of particular interest to Senator Burns, of course. In South Australia almost 16 per cent, which was the highest of all the States, came from that source. In Tasmania it was also nearly 16 per cent. The State with the lowest figure of household income from that source was Victoria with 11 1/2 per cent. But the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was lower still with just under 5 per cent. I expect that would be due to the fact that there is a much smaller proportion of aged people in the ACT and a much higher proportion of those who are aged would have substantial superannuation payments. The ACT also has a very low unemployment rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the policy enunciated by the honourable member for Wentworth, Dr Hewson, yesterday were to be implemented by the present Opposition should it get into government, firstly, it is very clear that all low income people-poor people, if one wants to use that term-throughout Australia would be adversely affected. The greatest impact would be on the States of South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. The least impact would be on those parts of the country which are already the most prosperous, namely, Victoria and the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is quite properly a matter of legitimate concern to Senator Burns, as a representative of Queensland, and also a matter of concern to those people who purport to represent Tasmania and South Australia, that Dr Hewson be firmly told that he should not proceed with his program. However, Dr Hewson will have difficulty if he is not allowed to proceed with his program of cutting the entitlements or rates that people receive, particularly if he has to fund the ambitious plans of Senator Newman and many smaller or lesser lights in the Opposition to spend a great deal more money elsewhere.</PARA>

Is the Minister further aware that there is considerable disenchantment on the part of the Chinese who, after signing contracts subject to DIFF finance with Australian companies, are being asked to wait 12 months or more before the contracts can be further progressed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would certainly like to ensure that enough funds were available under the DIFF scheme, not only to support all possible and conceivable contracts that might satisfy its criteria to China but also, indeed, to elsewhere. But, as Senator Hill and the Opposition ought to be aware, in these circumstances one has to balance the advantages that flow to the external trade account from contracts of this kind against the fiscal downside that is involved in an ever expanding contribution to the DIFF component of the aid budget. That has got further problems in an environment where it is difficult to keep the aid budget growing at the level at which we would want it to grow in terms of aid policy generally, quite apart from the commercial spin-offs that are involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, my understanding of the present situation so far as Chinese contracts are concerned is that all existing DIFF commitments will be able to be satisfied in the forthcoming financial year; that is to say, contracts in respect of which formal offers have been made and in respect of which contracts either have been formally signed or are about to be, pursuant to those formal offers. It may be, depending on the budgetary outcome, that any new formal offers that are made next financial year 1989-90, and are subject to new contracts being entered into during the course of financial year 1989-90, might not be able to be the subject of draw down from the Government Treasury until financial year 1990-91. But we are talking about contracts that have yet to be entered into, rather than those that are already, as it were, at the stage of about to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> More generally, there have been claims that Australia is missing out on commercial opportunities in China. But those claims ignore the reality of Australia's trade with China and the very considerable effort that the Government has been investing in promoting trade and two-way investment between the two countries. Two-way trade between Australia and China has grown substantially from $A720m in 1983 to $1.9 billion in 1988. Obviously regular high level visits by leaders and Ministers of both countries have helped to advance commercial interests as well as the political and multilateral ones. Government to government consultative arrangements have been established in a number of specific sectors, including wool, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, coal, transport and communications, machinery, and electronics products. We have of course got major Chinese investments in two very large resource-based projects in Australia, the Channar iron ore mine and the Portland aluminium smelter, while a range of Australian companies has been establishing joint ventures in China to gain a foothold into the Chinese market and to operate as a platform for export to third countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Current events in China notwithstanding, the Government will continue its efforts to enhance trade relations with China and to help the Australian private sector identify opportunities in China. We will continue to support financially, as best we can, through the DIFF program such commercial exercises in terms of contracting for major development oriented tenders. But necessarily the extent to which that support is available will have to depend on budgetary considerations, as those opposite will find out if they ever, God help the country, get the chance to try to apply these principles in practice. It is very easy to make promise after promise for sector after sector, commercial or otherwise, about what they will do by way of funding these intrinsically desirable, wholesome and admirable objectives. But they cannot do that while they are simultaneously claiming that very large sums ought to be chopped from the Commonwealth Budget. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. It is about time they woke up to that and about time the people who got suckered into believing that they are capable of delivering across the range of issues where they do make these promises, woke up to what it is they are about.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset in answering Senator Foreman's question I think it should be made very clear that the Government rejects such a broad sweep approach as has been advocated by the Opposition in the social welfare area. This particular area highlights the differences between the Government's constructed, targeted policy in this area compared to the sweeping, damaging rhetoric of the Opposition. The Opposition policy is one that is clearly not acceptable to the Government. In saying that, I should say that the Government's approach to social security has been based on maintaining the integrity of the system while ensuring that assistance does in fact go to those most in need. At the same time the Government is concerned about breaking down the barriers to employment. For instance, the jobs, employment and training program and the Newstart program are two specific programs which are geared towards helping sole parents and long term unemployed overcome particular barriers to work force participation. The underlying commitment of this Government, which is one that we maintain very strongly, is to those groups in the community for which there is an acceptable level of dependency, such as the aged and the disabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The alternative approach-the one that has been espoused increasingly over recent days by the Opposition-is one that is born out of ignorance and expediency. The Opposition just does not understand. It has said it will slash, but it should be placed on record that out of convenience it has refused to say where it will slash. It is fair to ask, as Senator Foreman does, which areas would be under the hammer under Opposition policy.</PARA>
<PARA> If we are looking at those areas where major inroads can be achieved we are looking at four or five major ones. The questions the Opposition has to answer and the questions the Government has rejected in this area are questions such as these: Will the target be the 1.7 million age and service pensioners in Australia; will the target be the family allowance payments which are made to nearly two million families with more than 3.8 million children in this country; or will the target be payments for 1.2 million children in 530,000 low income families in this country? Does Dr Hewson look to tighten the income test? Will he, through the back door approach, abolish tax and fringe benefit concessions for age pensioners? The Opposition has a responsibility to spell out precisely what it is thinking in these areas, not only for the general economic good of this country but also for the direct need, security and interests of those who would be targets under any such Opposition policy.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have here is also an indication of a policy born out of ignorance and lack of understanding of what has happened in the social security system over the past six years. For the sake of the record the Senate needs to know that. Since 1983 social security outlays have fallen from 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.2 per cent in 1987-88 to a projected 6 per cent this year. There has been a major shift there. In terms of proportion of real Budget outlays they have decreased from 24.1 per cent in 1983-84 to 23 per cent this year. Another important part of the Government's achievement is that since 1983 the proportion of pensioners and beneficiaries has fallen from 41.9 per 100 people in the labour force to 35.2.</PARA>
<PARA> One reason why we reject the proposal floated over the weekend is that it would destroy substantially the work of the past seven years that this Government has been forced to undertake because of the destructive legacy from those before us. We also reject it because it would imperil one basic achievement of this Government. One of the most basic parts of social security in our society is employment. When we came to office 600,000 people were receiving unemployment benefits. At the moment we are in a position where 400,000 people receive the unemployment benefit. There is nothing more basic to helping those in need than providing employment. The sorts of destructive and ill thought out policies that have been floated over the weekend would do nothing more than imperil this Government's achievements in the social security area, which society recognises have been major. It would also imperil some major parts of those achievements which relate directly to decreasing barriers to work force participation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support aware that Telecom services in Queensland, especially telephone installations, are being unduly disrupted and delayed because requests for allocations of portable phones by Telecom technicians and linesmen have been denied? I understand the situation is this: if a telephone records a fault that line is automatically shut down by the Telecom computer and it cannot be reconnected until the attendant technician phones through to his local headquarters at the completion of the job. With that particular telephone out of action the technician is unable to contact the depot so he has to find another telephone. Two-way radio is out of the question in these regions because of distance and terrain. In rural areas such as the Gold Coast hinterland this means the technician sometimes has to drive many kilometres to report that he has completed the job. He then has to return to wherever he was working to make sure the reconnection came through. If there is some further hitch the procedure has to be repeated, resulting in a major waste of man hours and undue delays in telephone installations because the technicians are out all the time on repair work. The problem could be overcome by issuing the outside workers with portable telephones, as is done in southern States. Will the Minister take steps to overcome this problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce seen a report in Saturday's Melbourne Age under the by-line of the winner of the 1989 Michael Daly Prize for Science Reporting in the Print Media, that is, Mr Graeme O'Neill, which confirms the Government's misleading funding figures for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)? It is correct that the Government, in calculating the funding figure for the CSIRO in 1987-88, omitted to make an allowance for the inflation rate? Is the 1987-88 funding figure therefore artificially low and does it not make the projected funding for successive years, which are all represented in 1988-89 dollars, appear more generous in comparison? As a result of the misleading base figure for 1987-88, is it not a fact that CSIRO will be worse off over the next three years than it was last year? Who is responsible for this error in basic arithmetic, or did the Government intentionally use a misleading base figure so as to give the mistaken impression that funding for the CSIRO was escalating, when in fact it was decreasing in real terms?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2895" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding of this matter is that it is not the funding estimates which were flawed, but rather the information which was supplied to the journalist Graeme O'Neill. Figures circulated to journalists at the release of the May science statement were not, in the view of the Government, flawed. They were supplied for CSIRO's appropriation in 1987-88 terms, while the amounts given for the years 1988-89 to 1991-92 were in 1988-89 dollars. It is standard practice to make comparisons between budgetary figures from different years in nominal terms. It should be noted that the figures quoted for the 1989-90 year and the two subsequent years are in 1988-89 dollars and thus will need to be inflated by the CPI figures in those years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To say that is not to deny that the Government has progressively decreased the CSIRO's appropriation budget over the past six years. These reductions were part of a policy of making the CSIRO more reliant on externally generated revenue. I should also point out that decisions by the Government in March this year provided CSIRO with an additional $5m for equipments for this current year and allowed CSIRO to retain all its external earnings, thereby adding a further $2.1m to its budget this year, $6.5m next year and $11.6m in 1990-91. When combined with the additional $90m provided for CSIRO in the May statement over the next five years, this reflects a substantial increase in funds since the August 1988 Budget in the Government's contribution to the Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran also put a couple of smaller parts in his question. I would make the point that the CSIRO budget position was considered at recent board and executive committees of the Organisation. A three-year budget is now being finalised and will allow for substantially increased flexibility to accommodate resource and priority changes, which are determined by the board of CSIRO in consultation with management.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only have I seen the article but I also have a copy of it here. I will not pretend that I normally read the Woman's Day, but this was such a very good article that a number of my staff drew it to my attention and said that I should read it. This very moving article describes the difficulties of this family. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as the sheer isolation, there have been droughts and floods and it's not unusual for the property to be cut off altogether through the vagaries of the outback weather and less than adequate country roads.</PARA>
<PARA>I was certainly very moved by that article, but not so much that I was persuaded that more Commonwealth Budget funds should be allocated for road improvements for this particular Queensland family. The roads for this particular family have already been unbelievably improved-indeed, to an incredible standard. The family concerned is none other than that of John Bjelke-Peterson, the son of the former Premier and of Senator Bjelke-Petersen. This action that has already been taken to improve the roads for this particular family includes the declaration of the little used 105-kilometre long Apis Creek to Duaringa road which runs through `The Ten Mile', which is the name of the Bjelke-Petersen property, and the adjoining `Crystal Waters' property-also owned by the family-as a main road. So 105 kilometres of what was previously a bit of a bullock track has been declared a main road. That is not the end of it. There has also been an allocation of $400,000 to upgrade just under eight kilometres of the road starting at the southern boundary of `Crystal Waters' and heading south. This seven kilometres of road on which $400,000 is being spent stops as soon as it hits `Crystal Waters'. I do not believe that there is any case for an additional allocation of Commonwealth taxpayers' funds to improve the roads for that particular Queensland family or for that property.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course the article was also about some other matters, such as Mr John Bjelke-Petersen's ambitions to come into politics, even though this article reports that at that stage his father was urging him not to. I note in yet another inconsistency that this morning's press reports that Sir Joh does intend to come back into politics, and probably into Federal politics. If I may offer a little bit of gratuitous advice, could I suggest that he time his run for a return to politics in the Federal Parliament as beautifully as he did last time.</PARA>

In fact, I was expecting it last Friday from Senator Stone and then again today, but I note that Senator Stone is not in the chamber. I assume that Senator MacGibbon is filling in for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen Mr Johnston's comments. I do not know what I can say other than that Mr Johnston admitted that he and the Reserve Bank had misjudged the likely or actual strength of the economic growth that was under way. It is fairly clear that almost everybody did. Anybody who gets into the business of forecasting, whether it is weather forecasting or economic forecasting, is bound to make mistakes. Even Senator Stone made a spectacular mistake with his not so much a forecast as an edict issued in October 1987 that there would be a world recession in 1988. Senator Stone was spectacularly wrong about that. Governments make mistakes about economic forecasts and bankers make mistakes in forecasting economic outcomes. The Australian Financial Review from time to time publishes what is said by leading private sector forecasters, some of whom are bankers and some of whom are representatives of stockbroking firms, and they are sometimes spectacularly wrong on things such as foreign exchange rates 12 months hence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has admitted that we did not realise that the underlying economic growth was as strong and therefore that the pressures on the economy were as strong. That pressure comes from two sources, the same two from which it always comes, I suppose. They are consumption spending, which has been quite high, and investment spending, which has been at incredibly high levels. That level of investment spending, according to the figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today, is expected to hold into the next six-monthly period, in spite of, I suppose one could say, the high interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> Adjustments have been made. We are continuing with the tight monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of Australia, as Senator MacGibbon would know, increased its rediscount rate last week by something like 0.3 of one per cent. Some of the bankers-perhaps I should say some of the economic commentators who speak about this issue, including the shadow Treasurer-have also warned that a tight monetary policy, if held in place for too long, might overshoot, and that is a danger. Nobody can be certain that he is correct about when it is appropriate to relax that monetary policy.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the answer to Senator Chapman's question is as follows: No. The rates charged by hire car firms in the ACT for services provided to the Commonwealth result from quotes made by hire car firms in competitive tenders. The contract between the Commonwealth and the hire car firms includes an annual percentage increase to the contract rates. There is provision for contractors to waive the right to this percentage increase. No contractor has waived the right to the first percentage increase in the current period. This type of price escalation is common in panel period contracts. The first increase took effect on 5 May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The current rate paid by the Commonwealth is $53.38 per hour on a `pick up to drop' time basis. This is comparable with rates charged to the private sector which range from around $35 per hour to $100 per hour, depending on the nature of the service. The private sector rates are, however, generally charged on a `depot to depot' time basis. The Government does not arbitrarily establish the rate for the use of hire cars for Commonwealth work. The rate is based on the outcome of an open tender process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in Question Time Senator Walsh gave a long harangue in answer to a question, the contents of which had been obtained, if you please, from the Woman's Day magazine. Government senators have really run short of questions when they start to ask questions obtained from that source. Nevertheless, Senator Walsh said that water was being pumped to our property by a pump on the Mackenzie River. That is entirely wrong. I resent the fact that he continues to mislead the Senate in this way. He tells complete untruths about these matters. He should not believe all that he reads in the newspapers; that must be where he gets his information from. As I said during Question Time, the dam to which he referred is at least 30 miles from our property. Plenty of water is provided by the dear Lord from the anabranch and the Mackenzie River, particularly during the present time of high rainfalls. I resent this continued use of Question Time to talk about my family and its affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the road which has been referred to, the closest bitumen road to the property is 30 miles away-the main road from Rockhampton to Longreach. That is a long way. So far as the allegation that the road was built for our family is concerned, let me point out that John flies an aeroplane and very rarely uses the road. It is a silly waste of Question Time to talk continually about our family and its activities. It might do Senator Walsh a lot of good some time to get into a motor car and drive on that terrible corrugated road from Duaringa up to the property. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government to ensure a flexible and efficient working environment on the Australian waterfront through lasting and genuine reforms, including the introduction of full enterprise employment, appropriate changes in union coverage and the elimination of restrictive work practices. </PARA>
<PARA>At a time when there is a heavy legislative program, the Opposition is reluctant to add items of business. However, after the economic news of the last few weeks, and in view of the clear difficulties faced by Australia, as well as by its working men and women, it is vital to draw to the Government's attention some of the areas in which it could take action that would do something to relieve our predicament. The context of this debate is one in which we have a frightening level of international debt. Our debt will continue to rise, not only because of the decline in the value of the dollar, but also because the fundamentals of our economy are so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The national accounts bringing us to up to the March quarter, which were published just last week, show that, by comparison with the previous 12 months, in real terms, our exports of goods and services declined by over 3 per cent, and our imports rose by 29.6 per cent. That is the situation that Australia finds itself in, and clearly it is a very serious one. But the people of Australia are affected more directly by the other policies that flow from the Government's failure to cope with the external situation. Most of all, the people of Australia are affected by high interest rates, which, for home buyers, have now reached 17 per cent and threaten to go to 18 per cent, and, for other borrowers, including small businesses and farmers, have gone to much higher levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that one can encapsulate the human element of the predicament in which Australia now finds itself better than by going back to a matter that was debated a month or so ago, when we were looking at the capacity of Australians to buy their own homes. Young Australian couples are being told by lending authorities that if they postpone their childbearing by 10 years they might be able to get a housing loan. Young married couples wanting to buy a house are being told that a 10-year delay in starting a family is a condition of their getting the funds to buy a home. There could be no clearer demonstration of the fact that the Government has adopted in its economic management an approach that is thoroughly destructive of everything that this country previously stood for. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the waterfront is relevant to all those matters. If one looks at the problem that we face, and at the Government's own diagnosis of it, one sees that this country is simply not productive enough. It is not an Opposition shibboleth to say that Australia needs to produce more; it is a view that has been put forward by Mr Keating, who, before he went off on his junket to Paris and his junket to Russia-and we have had no adequate explanation of those junkets at a time of economic crisis-said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is really only one message that can be drawn from our current circumstances . . . It is, simply, that our current account deficit is too high because we are spending more than we can produce. </PARA>
<PARA>We have also referred in debate in the Senate to what the Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say. He talked about our predicament in very similar terms. He talked about Australians living in a state of self-indulgence, which is a pretty extraordinary thing to say when Australian home buyers are paying 17 per cent on their mortgages. Mr Johnston was making the same point as the Treasurer, that we are consuming more than we produce and that if we are to solve our problems we need to be more productive. Indeed, in that speech which received so much publicity, Mr Johnston said that the economy would improve only if we provided conditions in which Australia could get on with constructive policies to improve the balance of payments. He added:</PARA>
<PARA>This highlights the urgency of shifting resources into export and import competing industries and improving productivity and cost performance. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no escaping the imperative that, if we are to get Australia out of its terrible mess, we have to become a more productive country. </PARA>
<PARA> Every Australian knows that the waterfront is an area of gross waste. I doubt that there is a man, woman or child, other than a child of very tender years, who does not know that the waterfront is one of the causes of our impoverishing Australia. It is an area where there is gross waste and where the attempts of Australians to improve productivity through exporting goods and services or importing necessary goods are impeded by the expensive shenanigans that go on on our waterfront. They are shenanigans which involve not just trade unionists but often employers as well. We have extensive documentation of the problems of the Australian waterfront. We have been told in this massive report of the Inter-State Commission some of the things which could be done to do away with some $650m-worth of waste, inefficiency and unnecessary costs adding to the personal burdens of Australians throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been given a blueprint for reform and change. It is not a blueprint that we think goes far enough, but it is one that we think would take the industry substantially down the road towards real reform. What do we find the Government doing? We find that the Government is prevaricating. Our object in bringing forward this debate today is to repeat the offer which I made on behalf of the Opposition last week: our complete cooperation with the Government to solve these problems. Once again, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, who has not said a serious thing about the economy in the Senate for a very long time, giggles his way through Question Time and now through this debate because he has the belief that the Government, of which he is a part, no longer has the capacity to deliver fundamental reform, no longer has any life expectancy and no longer has the guts and the determination which are required to make the necessary changes within Australia. Senator Button and his Government seem to be paralysed. We, in the Opposition, are saying that we are not the reason why the Government is paralysed. We are prepared to offer our fullest cooperation in the Parliament, both with respect to the necessary changes in the law and to appropriating moneys which are required to complete this plan, because we believe that it is vitally important for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the response of the Government? Does the Government say, `Thank you, we agree that this is an urgent problem that should be fixed in Australia's national interest.'? Of course it does not. The Government is locked away in meetings with the trade union movement and with employers desperately trying to work its way through its usual conundrum. How can it make the fundamental reforms which are necessary in Australia without the support of the trade union movement, which tends to have a rather negative view about reforms which will affect the power and influence of that movement? This report is a very useful, objective and non-political summary of what is wrong with our waterfront and why there is a need for change. We are told that there is ineffective management; poor work force training and career arrangements; introspective industrial attitudes; poor response to user needs-in other words, the customer can go to hell; the consumer is not regarded-poor information flows; lack of supply and demand balance; a tendency for matters to improve while they are under investigation but to lapse once the pressure is removed; and an abuse of monopoly power, reflected particularly in port authority pricing and investment policies. These are a whole lot of things which are to be fixed. We call upon the Government to do it, and to do it as a matter of urgency, not because it is important for its own sake, but because it is important if we are to solve the economic problems of Australia. This non-political report says:</PARA>
<PARA>To this litany can be added high costs, endemic unreliability, a high level of industrial disputation, inappropriate manning levels and work practices, poor discipline, poor motivation throughout the industry, and a pervasive lack of competition. </PARA>
<PARA>That expression, `a pervasive lack of competition', really does get to the heart of the matter. If we look at the areas of inefficiency and waste in the Australian economy, the areas which are causing our lack of productivity, which in turn is causing the high interest rates which are bedevilling virtually every Australia, they are all in areas where there is a lack of competition. The Inter-State Commission report sets out to ensure that our waterfronts are forced to act in a more competitive way, because the Commission has made a statement in this report which I think is fundamentally important if we are to tackle any of these areas of structural inefficiency in the Australian economy. The Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission has . . . made recommendations designed to preserve competition once the artificial constraints are removed. </PARA>
<PARA>One might ask why that is important. Well, it is important because the pattern of change on the waterfront is like the pattern of change of so much in Australia. There have been 12 inquiries into the waterfront. Many of those inquiries have resulted in changes, but the effect of each inquiry and the effect of each change has been to leave us where we were before-no competition and hence a situation where restrictive work practices, waste and inefficiency flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> The key thing about the Opposition's approach to this, and the key elements of this report which lead us to support it, are that it is putting forward proposals which will lead to genuine competition on the waterfront and which will force people to change as circumstances change and to remain efficient. What we are talking about is an industry where it is common ground that the waste is in excess of $600m. The Business Council of Australia says it is over $800m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Direct, as Senator Parer, who will be participating in this debate a little later, says-$800m of direct waste. We could add over $1 billion to the wealth available in this country if we could only get an efficient waterfront. That is the simple proposition we are seeking. I know that the Minister who is now at the table, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, who I am rather sorry was translated into Foreign Affairs, when he was Minister for Transport and Communications knew that, if we were to turn Australia around, we had to come to grips with these areas of waste and inefficiency. He was a Minister with some stomach for it, but now we have Ministers like Willis and Morris, who have no stomach for any reform or change which does not have the blessing of the trade union people who might suffer some short term ill-effect from it. We have lost the impetus for reform in this country under the current Ministers. I am very sorry that has happened, because it is costing Australia dear, including 17 per cent and 18 per cent interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We find that the trade union movement has made it clear that it is extremely doubtful about some of these areas of fundamental change. In a statement on 22 May, just a few days ago, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (WWF) Acting General Secretary, John Coombs, said that the union would never budget on the issues of withdrawal of coverage from small ports and container depots, the inclusion of automatic stand-down provisions in awards, compulsory redundancy, the contracting out of work and the use of casuals. </PARA>
<PARA> When we reel off the things the union is opposed to, I suppose the average listener asks: Does it matter? Are these things that the union is objecting to serious? Let me therefore quickly focus on one of the things that the Waterside Workers Federation is objecting to. Do honourable members know it has been found that our ports are about half as efficient as the ports of the countries that we compete with? When we look at this area of coverage of the Waterside Workers Federation and look at how that affects the packing and unpacking of containers, we get a perfect illustration of why change is needed and why the Waterside Workers Federation's interest is not the national interest, it is not the interest of the people of Australia, because we can test it from current practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Some containers are loaded on premises which are covered by the Waterside Workers Federation and others are packed on premises which are covered by the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia. In other words, we have the chance to compare the packing and unpacking of containers in areas where the Waterside Workers Federation is involved and in areas where it is not. The simple reality is that in those areas where there is WWF coverage the rate of packing and unpacking is sadly much lower than the rate where there is other union coverage. There is a very interesting account in the Business Review Weekly of 26 May of a courageous businessman who is trying to fight this area of waste and inefficiency. It is pointed out in that article that these packing restrictions go back to 1967. It is the great old Australian way, having these sorts of restrictions. We find that, where the WWF is involved, the cost of packing a container runs to more than $600, but the cost elsewhere is less than $400. In other words, there is an extra couple of hundred dollars just for the privilege of being forced into a depot that is manned by the WWF instead of by the Transport Workers Union of Australia or the Storemen and Packers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a small example of what this argument on union coverage is about. It is about whether we are going to continue to do things wastefully and inefficiently and tell the people of Australia to go to hell. That is what we are being told, `You, the people of Australia, you the consumers who are paying this extra $650m or $800m, whatever figure one likes to agree with, can just go jump in the lake, because the fact of the matter is that our union coverage is what counts, not the interests of the people, not the interests of the firms and the consumers who are affected, but the interests of the union against the interests of a different union. The WWF should have superior rights to the Transport Workers Union or the Storemen and Packers Union just because it is there'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is how foolish it is, and it is that sort of pressure that a government, which has Ministers like Willis and Morris in it, will not withstand. We will never solve the economic problems of Australia unless the Ministers in this Government are prepared to have the courage to act in the national interest and not in the sectional interest. I call upon the Government to avail itself of the clear and straightforward offer of cooperation which we, the Opposition, have made. We will pass the legislation through the Parliament. We will support the appropriation for the necessary funds, because we think that reform in this area is absolutely vital and in the interests of Australia. Let me make it quite clear: we are not prepared to support any reform which is not fundamental. My definition of fundamental should be clear from what I have already had to say. We insist on those reforms which at a minimum at least are the product of the report of the Inter-State Commission-we would like to go further-reforms which will guarantee that there is genuine competition on the waterfront. Labour market reform itself is essential. We are prepared to see $150m or more of taxpayers' money used to buy out the thousands of waterside workers who should be retired because they are no longer an effective and efficient part of the work force. We are prepared to pay-the people of Australia will have to pay of course-huge sums of money to get those people out of the industry so that it can work efficiently. But we will not support the payment of that money unless it is part of a pattern which entitles employers to hire and fire the people who will do the work, and not to have to be forced to hire people who are not their choice but are the choice of the union. Some of them might not wish to work in an iron lung, if I may use that expression. We will not have any truck with that sort of change. We insist that the change must encompass tackling the monopoly power of the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no desire to attack any particular union. No particular union is entitled to hold the people of Australia to ransom. We expect the Waterside Workers Federation to attract its membership by being the best union, not conscripting people by having monopoly powers on the waterfront. We say that the argument-I gave it in encapsulated form when quoting the packing and unpacking of containers-that the Waterside Workers Federation should have some monopoly has to go. We believe there has to be genuine enterprise employment, with the power to stand people down and to do all the things that are normal in a contract of employment. We believe that these essential elements of the Inter-State Commission's report deserve the support of the Government and the Opposition because they would bring great benefits to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We are often challenged in this place to say what we as an Opposition would do to solve Australia's economic problems. Reform of the waterfront is a $600m-plus contribution to solving Australia's economic problems. It is one of the necessary steps which must be taken. On behalf of the Opposition I commend this motion as a matter of genuine urgency, as this country tumbles towards bankruptcy and our people suffer unbelievable hardship under a regime of ridiculously high interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I am indebted to Senator Chaney for his passing compliment in the course of his speech about my approach to micro-economic reform, which is not calculated to assist me in my next pre-selection, I have to say nonetheless that so far as wasting the time of the Senate goes, in this very same week that a major statement is to come down from the Government addressing all the issues that are the subject matter of this motion, this effort of Senator Chaney's today is in a class of its own. The reform of the waterfront is, and manifestly has been, a major priority in the Hawke Government's micro-economic agenda. We acknowledge it to be a matter of urgency. We do not need any motion of this kind to put it to us in those terms. I will be happy to detail a little later the kind of effort this Government has already undertaken up until now in pursuit of such reform. Later in the week I will be very happy to make a much more detailed statement on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) as to how we are addressing the issue right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is only one reason why waterfront reform has become so necessary-we acknowledge it to be such-that is, that the conservative parties, both during the Fraser years and in their preceding decades in government, allowed gross deficiencies to develop in the shipping industries and on the waterfront. Many of the present underlying problems on the waterfront, which we do acknowledge exist, stretch back to the introduction of containerisation in the late 1960s. This was a time when the coalition was in power but it failed to address in any systematic or coherent way the issues that were brought about by such a fundamental change. The Fraser Government's approach to these problems was simply to duck for cover by handing the industry over to the employers and the unions to fix. Fraser abolished the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in 1977 and handed over most of its functions to the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour, the AEWL, which now controls employment arrangements in conjunction with the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF). The then Government did not begin to attempt to put any strategy in place to ensure that improvements were achieved. Its record of micro-economic reform on the waterfront, as elsewhere, was a great big fat zero. That is the basis on which Senator Chaney and his colleagues come and preach the nostrums that we have been hearing today. They have never had any positive ideas about how to address these issues, only destructive ones. I will come in a moment to what the current batch of ideas amount to, as spelt out in the Future Directions documents. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that one is able to gauge the credentials of the Opposition parties when it comes to a difficult and tricky measure of micro-economic reform in which vested interests are obviously playing a considerable role, one has only to look at the appalling performance in the context of wheat deregulation in recent weeks to see what heart, what stomach, there is on the Opposition side to address these admittedly extremely difficult and hard issues with a long history of entrenched inefficiency and mismanagement behind them. One looks for more than hollow, empty grandstanding rhetoric of the kind we heard today from Senator Chaney and of the kind which is no doubt going to become endemic under the Opposition led by Andrew Peacock. That is the only kind of approach to political problem solving that is understood by this Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Future Directions document which Mr Peacock has said will be retained as the Opposition's policy manifesto says that the problems we are experiencing on the waterfront, as elsewhere, have been brought about by `restrictive trade practices which have vested unions with excessive power'. The solution proposed by the coalition in that document is the implementation of essential services legislation. If that is the kind of legislative cooperation that Senator Chaney is offering us today, if that is the hand of friendship he stretches across the chamber, not only in the context of buying out through appropriations to pay for some redundancy, if he is handing us the offer of legislation of that kind, which he has gone on record and has not stepped away from--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not concede that for a moment. What I am saying is that to the extent that there is a softer approach embodied in the Industries Assistance Commission report, to the extent that it does involve some attempt through appropriate financial support to the industry to secure redundancies that might not otherwise be obtainable, then that softer approach is the one the Government has already said in principle it adopts and will be seeking to implement. But it is not that kind of approach which has traditionally lain behind the Opposition's approach to these issues. Whatever Senator Chaney may be saying today-I am interested to have him spell out his stepping away from the Future Directions documents-it is obvious, notwithstanding Mr Peacock's re-statement of the value and centrality of that document to the Opposition's thinking, that there is going to be a steady stepping away from it. If this is the first sign we have seen of it today, so much the better for the future of this country. If we are to take seriously the kind of underlying approach to these policy issues that is writ large in that document, then one must believe that a return to the mailed fist of essential services legislation is very much a centrepiece of what the Opposition has in mind in dealing with this and related issues-that is to say, the politics of confrontation. If we apply the politics of confrontation to the environment that we are all too well aware exists in many of these difficult areas, not least the waterfront and shipping services, what we are talking about is a recipe for massive further damaging disruption. It is that consensual approach, the approach that tries to establish long term sustainable reform through negotiated consensus, the approach that is absolutely central to the thinking and style in government of my colleagues Ralph Willis and Peter Morris, that will ensure genuine longstanding reform in this as in other areas, not the kind of heavy-handed government prescription which is, and certainly has been in the past, central to the Opposition's approach to these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very sad tale, a repeat of apathy and neglect, that the Opposition can offer by way of credentials in dealing with this sort of issue. In all that is ever said by the Opposition on this or any other micro-reform issue, the first question that must be asked in order to test the credibility of the claims and the prescriptions that are being made is: what did the Opposition do when it had the chance over nearly 30 years in government to do something about these industries when problems were showing up? What did it do? Where are the runs on the board? There are no runs on the board, and it is a matter of extreme gall and effrontery that we should be preached to in this fashion by an Opposition that is so conspicuously lacking in any effective performance. The chutzpah in this respect is rivalled only by the futility of seeking to debate this question at a time when my colleague Mr Willis is due later this week to deliver a major statement on reform of coastal shipping and the waterfront. Even Senator Chaney would realise that I am not in a position-I am not about to and do not want to-to pre-empt that statement here today, except to say that what is announced will be the result of exhaustive study and exhaustive discussion between all the parties. It has been an exhaustive process, and I will spell out in a few moments what it involves. I repeat that we have demonstrated across a broad range of micro-economic issues that the way to long term, sustainable reform is through that sort of process of exhaustive study and discussion rather than heavy-handed confrontation of the kind that has become endemic over the years in the Opposition's style when it has been in government and what we can certainly expect from the Future Directions document to be the basic prescription for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying no more than I have said already. I am not about to pre-empt the statement. The Government, through Mr Willis, has expressed a general commitment to the basic themes, the basic directions, the basic flavour, shape and direction of that document. The detailed response to that report and to this issue will be on the table later this week and I do not seek to pre-empt it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the underlying themes of Senator Chaney's speech, and indeed every other contribution by the Opposition on this question, has been the alleged willingness of the Government to run away from an effective commitment to micro-economic reform. I think that it is about time that the position was yet again stated clearly, specifically, un- equivocally and accurately for the record. This Government has already been one of the great achievers in micro-economic reform, structural adjustment and everything that goes with it.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me list for the record what the dimensions of that reform have been, because waterfront and shipping as well will form very much a part of this list by the time that the Minister's statement is made at the end of this week. Let me begin with the most fundamental area, which is tariff reform. We have had motor vehicle tariff reform involving the removal of tariff quotas on motor vehicles and the reduction of tariffs from 57 1/2 per cent to 35 per cent by January 1992. We have had textiles, clothing and footwear protection reform, with quotas being phased out by 1995, to leave then tariff-only protection. We have had general tariff reform. Quite apart from the two industries I have just mentioned and a small number of rates that would otherwise have become anomalous, all tariffs above 15 per cent are being reduced to 15 per cent, and those tariffs between 10 per cent and 15 per cent are being reduced to 10 per cent, all over four years to July 1992. The overall effect is a 30 per cent tariff reduction. The general revenue duty of 2 per cent was abolished at a cost of $240m, again grasping a nettle which had been conspicuously rejected over and over again by preceding governments when they had the opportunity to deal with this and all those other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1988 a systematic set of agricultural reforms was announced. Assistance to sugar, dried vine fruit, tobacco and citrus industries was converted to tariff and subject to the same reductions as applied to manufacturing industry. Generally domestic administered price arrangements have been liberalised, and there has been removal of the fertiliser subsidy. They were all hard, tough decisions to take, but those decisions have been taken, as decisions in respect of the waterfront in relation to shipping will be taken, with the best interests of this nation in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of aviation we have had the termination of the two-airline agreement announced, allowing greater competition and lower air fares to take effect in October 1990. We have had liberalisation of international passenger charter policy announced at the same time, and liberalisation of air freight in a variety of specific ways which will be the subject of further announcements shortly. We have had other transport reforms, with improvement in performance in the rail freight network, including grain handling. This has been addressed by our recent announcement that we will have the stomach to introduce, whatever the reaction may finally prove to be in from the Opposition, measures to override restrictive State grain transport regulations, particularly those establishing rail monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of oil and gas marketing, we have had enormously significant deregulation of the crude oil industry effective from 1 January 1988. Refiners and crude oil producers have had the capacity to negotiate freely the quantities and prices of crude oil they buy and sell. There has been the termination of the administered natural gas pricing formula, allowing at the same time a more flexible approach to price setting and relegating export controls to a strictly reserve power. Again, that has been micro-reform of a fundamentally significant kind. There has been ample opportunity going back for decades for the Opposition to do something about it, but there was never anything more than the kind of hollow, empty rhetoric such as we have heard today. </PARA>
<PARA> The telecommunications micro-reform package that I announced in May 1988 allows effective competition in the provision of customer premises equipment in relation to value added services and other telecommunications services, such as phone maintenance and so on, through regulatory changes, and also through the establishment to take effect from July this year of Austel as an independent body to subsume Telecom's regulatory functions, thus allowing effective competition in that area as well. All of this has been accompanied by an information industries plan, announced by the Government in 1987, to encourage multinational computer companies to increase their research and development and manufacturing operations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to all that, there has been reform generally of government business enterprises. Over 40 longstanding controls have been removed from nearly all the enterprises, not just in the transport, aviation and communications sectors but across the board, including their right to enter into contracts without ministerial approval, exemption from processes under the Public Works Committee Act, the ability to invest surplus moneys and enter into loan contracts, rights to hire and fire chief executives, the removal of many Public Service staffing and administrative practices, and the right to establish their own superannuation schemes. Those are either in place or have been announced. They are fundamental changes of a kind which previous governments comprising Liberal-National Party Ministers have never had the heart or the stomach to introduce, although they had ample reservoirs of the kind of rhetoric we have heard today. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole question of industry regulation was the subject of a major announcement in December 1988 introducing a request and response procedure for review of existing regulations and providing for industry driven regulatory reform. I shall not stop to mention, in addition to all of that, the tax reform measures, the reduction in company rates-again talked about for years, but matters which those opposite never did anything about when they had the chance to do so. There has been the rationalisation of a range of distorting tax reductions, and finally the liberalisation and deregulation of the entire financial system-just to cap off a record which on any view, by any account, by any criteria, is stunning. It is a reform which was long overdue to be implemented by a government because of the course of neglect over decades by those opposite when they had ample chance to do something about the position. </PARA>
<PARA> The course of waterfront reform has been protracted; it has been difficult and drawn out. It goes back to July 1984 when we sponsored the shore based shipping costs seminar. It extended from there to September 1984 when the industry task force on shore based shipping costs was established under the chairmanship of Mr Ian Webber. In response to those reports a further group of major studies and initiatives were put together, involving finally in December 1986 the formulation of an across-the-board waterfront strategy involving four separate dimensions. I refer to the Stevedoring Industry Review Committee examining employment related issues in the stevedoring sector; the Industry Committee reviewing impediments arising from commercial practices, inadequate documentation and communication systems; the importer-exporter panel representing the client industries on the waterfront; and the marine and ports group and the railway group of the Australian Transport Advisory Council progressing initiatives to address rail and port authority issues in consultation or with the involvement of the State and Territory governments. They are four hugely important, interrelated dimensions demonstrating by their very nature the complexity of the task. </PARA>
<PARA> While all that was happening the Inter-State Commission was tasked to prepare its report bringing those various threads together. That process has been going on for some time now, until the publication in April this year of the Inter-State Commission's final report. The recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, as Senator Chaney said, and as I cheerfully acknowledged, are aimed at addressing all aspects of the waterfront industry with a focus on fundamental structural change in the stevedoring sector. Those recommendations involve a major shift from current industry-wide employment arrangements to enterprise based employment. They involve in the container depot sector the elimination of a number of existing industrial constraints on international container depot operations. They do involve in the port authorities, a review by State and Territory governments of the allocation of port functions with a proposal that many commercial functions be divested and performed by differently structured authorities. These recommendations also involve the view that the Trade Practices Commission should develop greater expertise and generally take a more active role in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these recommendations are important. They do have a prima facie attractiveness about them and that has been acknowledged as such by the Government. But, as far as possible, we have been seeking to get consensus and negotiated solutions to the problems in this area because we know from hard-won experience that the kicking heads approach, the legislative override approach, the insensitive approach, is not the one that produces sustainable long term reform, and it is sustainable long term reform that is needed on the waterfront. While the unions and the stevedoring employers have indicated reservations, as Senator Chaney has said and as I acknowledge, about certain aspects of the report, it is the case that both groups have confirmed their acceptance of the need for waterfront reform and their general acceptance of the shape and direction of the proposals that are contained in the ISC report. The Hawke Government acknowledges a responsibility to take the lead to address the need for greater efficiency on the waterfront. The will for change exists, and the results of this combined effort and the way forward will be made clear in the Government's very detailed statement, later this week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it is a little more urgent now. Nevertheless, it is a re-run of precisely the same proposition that we debated in this chamber on 10 April. On 10 April the proposition was that the reform of the waterfront was to ensure efficiency and productivity rather than a national burden and an impediment. It would have been very difficult to disagree with that proposition, in the same way as today, in many respects, it is difficult to disagree with the proposition that we have before us, which suggests, as a matter of urgency, that the Government needs to ensure a flexible and efficient working environment on the Australian waterfront. Of course it does. The motion says that it should achieve this through lasting and genuine reforms. Of course it should. However, it is a question of how one achieves those genuine and lasting reforms. I must admit that the Australian Democrats have some reservations about whether those genuine and lasting reforms will be achieved by an aggressive, confrontationist approach in an industrial environment which has a history which suggests that confrontation and aggression are potentially disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not arguing with the essential elements of the proposition of the need for reform. I do not think anybody in his or her right mind would question the need for reform on the waterfront, nor does anybody challenge the essential validity and value of the report of the Inter-State Commission entitled Waterfront Investigation, known as the Butcher report. As Senator Chaney emphasised in his words of introduction, it is a most comprehensive, a most timely and a most responsible report, and the fundamental plan which is inherent in it is rational and attractive. It has been admitted as being attractive to the Government. In the final analysis all these things are a question of degree and of method. </PARA>
<PARA> In listening to Senator Chaney's remarks today-we acknowledge the fact that this re-run of the debate of 10 April is due to the fact that Senator Chaney is now the shadow Minister for industrial relations-I sensed that there was an element of image building inherent in the propositions that were advanced in such a forthright manner. When the shadow portfolio recently changed, some commentators observed the fact that Senator Chaney might be seen to be softer in his approach to his portfolio than was his predecessor. That is probably a valid observation. One senses that here today there has been some image building, some toughening, some hardening of the stomach, some flexing of the tough abdominal muscles of our new shadow Minister for industrial relations. I sense that because we have the same proposition before us today, after the change of portfolios, as we had before us on 10 April. In some respects Senator Chaney is projecting his new tough image in relation to industrial relations. To proffer an aggressive line in one of the toughest industrial arenas would have been an opportunity that he would have found too difficult to pass over. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Australian Democrats support the proposition that there is need for reform on the waterfront. We acknowledge the centrality and criticality of the waterfront to remedying our balance of payments difficulties. We see it as being central to a healthy economy and we endorse and support the fundamental recommendations and plans that have been advanced by the Inter-State Commission. I suppose we differ from Senator Chaney over the adoption of an aggressive and confrontationist approach to one controversial element-that of introducing competition to the waterfront. It is in that respect that we have serious reservations. In replying to Senator Chaney, Senator Gareth Evans said that if we were to achieve successful transformation of the Australian waterfront it would come about as a result of a cooperative and cautious approach rather than as a result of a confrontationist approach. Essentially, the Democrats agree with that and, for that reason, we will not be supporting the proposition put forward by the Opposition. It is not that we do not see it as a matter of urgency or importance, but that we differ as to the method and strategy. We observed in Senator Chaney's statement to the Senate today that he is giving a warning that as far as an alternative government is concerned it would be a boots and all approach to the waterfront. Frankly, we see that as being potentially disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely vital that one is cognisant of the history of the Australian waterfront when we move to implement a plan to remedy its inadequacies. It has been a battleground of the labour forces over the years, and the attitudes that have prevailed in that battleground will not be cast aside very readily. The apportionment of blame is always difficult. There has been a tendency, because of the bad image of the waterfront, to point the finger of blame only at labour. Such action ignores the fact that in any industrial context management has to accept its portion of the blame. So if the climate has been difficult and the waterfront has been a battleground, we do not believe that that blame lies wholly and solely with labour. In fact, this has been acknowledged in some of the comments that have come from those who have written in the press and made contributions and statements to the Commission prior to its bringing down its excellent report. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some of the reactions to the Butcher report. I believe that the reactions have been quite encouraging. Writing in the Australian Financial Review of 10 November 1988, Anne Davies states that the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) has given a clear signal that it is prepared to negotiate on significant changes to employment arrangements and will even consider a move to company employment. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals were included in the WWF submission to the Inter-State Commission, which is devising a strategy to improve efficiency on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarded as one of the most intractable unions in the country, the WWF indicated in its submission that it was prepared to discuss significant change in the industry, even on issues that were previously off the agenda, such as company employment. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not pessimistic about the signs and reactions that have been forthcoming from the Butcher report. An article that appeared in the Australian on 30 June states:</PARA>
<PARA> MSB-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Maritime Services Board-</PARA>
<PARA>general manager, Mr Les MacDonald told the commission during its Sydney hearings recently that various groups on the waterfront appeared to be trying to lay the blame for problems on others. </PARA>
<PARA>In the article Mr Les MacDonald says:</PARA>
<PARA> We all have contributions to make to the solution of the problems that exist on the waterfront and in the transport chain. It is important for all of us to accept at least part of the blame for the problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> He said the commission should look at how many of the links in the transport chain were really necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main contributors to the cost levels in the transportation of goods from the farm or mine to the ship, and transportation of goods inwards, was the amount of players in the chain in Australia, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr MacDonald was urging us to accept our share of the responsibility in tidying up the problems of the historically very vexed Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission cites some of the fundamental structural problems. It cites the fact that the work force is an ageing work force. It is one within which there are likely to be considerable difficulties in accepting the sorts of massive innovations that are necessary for the transitions to occur. It cites the fact that in work methods, and particularly in recording and processing of information and communication, there are duplications and delays and the methods are antiquated. Even those who lead the union movement on the waterfront cite these as sources of great difficulty. An article by Michelle Grattan in the Age of 24 April 1989 quotes Tas Bull, the leader of the WWF, on the structure of his work force:</PARA>
<PARA> `It looks like Dad's army-of course it does', admits the WWF's general secretary Tas Bull . . . `Thirty-three per cent of our members are over 55. There has been no recruitment in Sydney or Melbourne since 1975; no recruitment in Adelaide for 22 years, and only 10 recruited in Hobart since 1956.'</PARA>
<PARA>We have a work force that is entrenched in its attitudes and in its methods. It is inherently inflexible. It is a difficult industrial climate to work in. With the implementation of the excellent recommendations or fundamentals of the Butcher plan, there will have to be-as Senator Evans has emphasised-a strategy which is essentially one of cooperation and caution. </PARA>

If we create and return to the industrial turmoil and chaos of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in this arena, we will achieve nothing. We are confronted with an extraordinarily difficult and challenging economic climate. It is true that the clean-up and the improvement of the waterfront are fundamental to the improvement of the economy. But the confrontationist approach to industrial relations on that traditional, historical battleground of industrial relations is fraught with disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The plea of the Australian Democrats, as we move towards the implementation of the Butcher plan, is by all means to acknowledge the difficulties but to proceed with caution, to be rational and deliberate, and to accept the fact that the patterns of the waterfront in the past reflect the attitudes not only of labour but also of management. If we are to resolve these problems, it will have to be with an approach different from the one inherent in the proposition before the chamber today. It will have to be an approach different from the one outlined by Senator Chaney in his opening remarks in this debate. In essence, Senator Chaney said that the Opposition will support the Government in the implementation of the Butcher plan and that it is a good plan. However, he said that that will happen only provided the most controversial and confrontationist element of the plan-namely, the deregulation of labour and the heightening of competition-is addressed immediately and aggressively. Fundamentally, that is a contradictory statement. The successful implementation of this plan will depend upon caution and cooperation. I believe that Senator Chaney, in this urgency motion, is proposing not caution and cooperation but rather confrontation and aggression. For that reason the Australian Democrats oppose the urgency motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the urgency motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need for the Government to ensure a flexible and efficient working environment on the Australian waterfront through lasting and genuine reforms, including the introduction of full enterprise employment, appropriate changes in union coverage and the elimination of restrictive work practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that such an urgency motion has to be brought on for debate is evidenced by the recent media reports that the Federal Government and the waterfront unions are deadlocked in discussions over reforms. I make some points about another agreement that the parties have tried to put together just recently. On a one-off retirement and redundancy package, a position paper prepared by the parties states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no agreement in respect of early retirement arrangements for new entrants and further discussions will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>On recruitment it states:</PARA>
<PARA>This aspect is not agreed at this time by the unions. </PARA>
<PARA>On enterprise employment it states:</PARA>
<PARA>However there are fundamental matters which are not agreed and which will require further detailed discussion and resolution in relation to enterprise employment. </PARA>
<PARA>On award and job restructuring it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Agreement has not been reached an all matters. </PARA>
<PARA>On stand-down provisions it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parties to date have been unable to reach agreement on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>On contract maintenance it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parties to date have been unable to reach agreement on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>On container depots it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parties to date have been unable to reach agreement on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>On loading and discharging bulk vessels it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Unions are not prepared to withdraw from membership coverage . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. As Senator Parer has already interjected in this debate, this is urgent; this has to be attended to. For the good of Australia this has to be confronted and something has to be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is that the Federal Government-and especially the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-foolishly believes it is in control of Government policy. That is where this Labor Government is wrong. It has already been proved wrong many times in the last few years. The Government depends on the unions for its retention of government but forgets that the cost of this dependence is control by the unions over government policy. That is no secret. The unions have always made their power well and truly known to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple truth is that the Government is in a real mess over reforms on the waterfront. It made an undertaking to the Opposition during the wheat legislation debate that if the wheat growers made similar concessions it would move towards reform on the waterfront. If the Wheat Marketing Bill were to be passed, the Australian wheat growers would give up an orderly market system and be exposed to operations on a deregulated market. If that happens, it will be the Government's turn to honour its end of the bargain with its constituency. But here is the crunch: it cannot deliver because the unions will not deliver. The unions will not let the Government do it. I can give the assurance that this side of the chamber will be pursuing deregulation on the waterfront to the end, and right to the edge of the water. </PARA>
<PARA> All the talk about major policy announcements on reforms can be seen to be hot air. We read headlines that talks are bogged down and deadlocked over matters such as the size of the golden handshake needed to get rid of the deadwood on the wharves. Anybody who does not believe that there is deadwood needs only to read the rort report prepared by Senator Parer's office recently. It is so unbelievable that it could almost be a fairytale. For Australian farmers it is no fairytale. They know only too well the rorts and rip-offs on the wharves. Their whole year's work is often left sitting at risk of perishing or losing the market, because of the whims and fancies of the waterside workers. </PARA>
<PARA> An illustration of that was given last night on  60 Minutes. It was a program about a waterside worker spending some time on a farm and a farmer spending some time on the waterfront. The farmer's first comment when he was in front of the television cameras on the waterfront, when anyone could have staged it if he had wanted to, was, `How many old people are here on the waterfront'. He also said, `Look at all those people over there who are not doing anything'. He was asked some other questions and his words, which I think were interesting, were, `It was pretty boring because there wasn't much for me to do on the waterfront.'</PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront worker who went to the farm to do some work-a nice person and probably the youngest person, apart from the farmer, whom we saw on the television interview-made the point about how hard the work on the farm was. Another comment he made was that when something went wrong on the farm the farmer fixed it up and got on with the job whereas, on the waterfront, when two bolts were missing from a crane at one stage, everyone stopped work. The cost of that to the Australian export industry and to the Australian person is too high for this country to continue to pay in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not under-estimate the importance of an efficient waterfront to Australian trade, particularly the agricultural trade. Again, that is the point of Senator Parer's earlier interjection when he said that we must get on and do the job. The vast majority of Australia's overseas trade goes through the waterfront. In fact, the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on coastal shipping, published last July, claimed that over 99 per cent passes through Australian ports. Each day, $50m-worth of exports and $76m-worth of imports need to pass across the Australian waterfront. Since many of the same ports are involved in both domestic and international trade, the cost of inefficiency affects nearly every other industry in the economy. Australia's trade is exceptionally vulnerable to many unnecessary costs and unreliability. It is this vulnerability that has given waterfront employees the ability to negotiate conditions of employment that are generally well in excess of community standards and has permitted the absolute proliferation of work practices that today are commonly referred to as rorts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate a few examples. A national amenities agreement exists whereby an amenities man is provided on the waterfront whenever 15 A-registered workers are employed. His job is to wipe down tables in the amenities rooms after breaks. He may also act in a security capacity to look after workers' personal belongings. I can understand the last requirement as theft and pilferage are rife on the wharves. The amenities job goes on day and night; so, if 15  A-registered workers are rostered on during a day, an amenities man must be provided for the day shift and another on the night shift regardless of the number of workers actually working. This man's job is not to clean up; other cleaners are provided to do that. He is there to act as a butler to waterside workers. In Brisbane alone the annual bill for the wages of the amenities men was some $365,000, on-cost not included. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a rort involving glutmen on Brisbane wharves. Currently, two glutmen must be employed when preglutted timber packs are being worked on the wharves. Their alleged purpose is to pick up any gluts which may fall off the timber packs. The incidence of gluts falling off, I am told, is rare and certainly does not necessitate the employment of two workers permanently allocated to this function just waiting for things to fall off. Then there are the nick-off days when members of a gang draw straws to see who can return home for the day on full pay. </PARA>
<PARA> At Newcastle port there are 54 foremen and supervisors for 186 waterside workers. There seems a fair bit of chiefdom and not many Indians. At Wyndham in Western Australia, the 30 waterside workers average eight hours of work per week. Overmanning is rife among the tug operators. As with coastal ships there is a second crew for each tug, even though tugs do not leave their port. Currently at Melbourne full separate receival and full separate delivery gangs must be employed per vessel regardless of the workload involved. If 10 boxes were to be unloaded and 10 boxes were to be delivered to a vessel, two separate gangs would have to be employed. The Inter-State Commission report lists the average Australian efficient overseas container handling rate for 1988, and I seek leave to table the chart. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chart sets out quite clearly how inefficient Australian ports are. Crane efficiency is an indicator of how well working time is being used, and the chart shows that Australian crane operations are about half as efficient as the average overseas crane operations. The International Cargo Handling Coordination Association provided information to the Inter-State Commission which cited that Australia's major container ports are half as productive as their European counterparts and 40 per cent as productive as many Asian ports. Australian ports were the least efficient of all the ports surveyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I quote another recent study conducted by staff of the Industries Assistance Commission which found that 20 per cent improvement in labour productivity in the water transport industry combined with faster turnaround time of ships in ports would produce an initial cost saving of $860m in 1986-87 money terms. Senator Chaney has already mentioned that point. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This would lead in the long run to an increase of $1.1 billion in GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a large amount of money. The effect of the rorts and torts and the efficiencies on the waterfront can be brought to the attention of the Senate by referring to a letter that a Tamworth company, Bettington Commodities, wrote to me about the problems associated with the waterfront:</PARA>
<PARA>My business is a small, totally Australian-based trading and packing business-my office is located in Tamworth (New South Wales) and the packing business, (established totally to develop export business), in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> I commenced my current business three and a half years ago as a domestic grain trader and was able to quickly establish myself in the industry. Last year, 1987, I began to show interest in starting to develop some export markets. I was successful in securing a contract to supply 2,000 tonnes of cotton seed to a client in Saudi Arabia . . . The customer was so pleased with the product and the way it was packed, that I managed to sell (to the same customer), a further 5,000 tonnes of cotton seed for delivery from June to August 1988. I was also able to sell to another client in Saudi Arabia a further 1500 tonnes of cotton seed for shipment in May 1988. The gross value of this business was approximately $2.2Million . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is good export income for Australia. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time I also managed to secure other new overseas business, principally to Japan, for cotton seed. The business amounted to a further 11,000 tonnes or approximately $2.9Million of business. Therefore, I managed to secure over $5Million worth of new export business for Australia . . . However, all has not been so pleasing. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We successfully packed our first 1500 tonnes of product to be shipped to Saudi Arabia in our one-tonne bags using unique equipment that I had specially manufactured for the purpose. We were booked to ship this consignment on a Yugoslavian ship belonging to J.S.P. Lines, called the `Heroj Paic'. The ship arrived in Brisbane Port on 25 May, 1988 and was to unload containers at Fisherman's Island Container Terminal. This was not commenced until 26 May, due to congestion at the terminal, but when the ship did in fact begin to unload, the rate of unloading was at less than five containers per hour. I am told that at any port in the world on that ship, fifteen containers per hour would be a normal slow rate and in good ports up to forty-five containers is possible. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Eventually the ship was loaded by the following Monday . . . some fourteen days after arriving at port for what should have been three to four days work. Due to the delays mentioned, we have become liable to pay demurrage to the shipping line of USD$3,000.00 per day . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My budgeted cost was a maximum of $28.00 per tonne . . . </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say, without continuing to read this letter, is that this person, who was going to supply an export income for the people of Australia, was thwarted in that attempt by a waterfront that had callous disregard for his income or the income that Australia would receive. This gentleman has had to close that export facility and Australia is the poorer for it. I support the motion moved this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The Government must take heed of it and get on with the job of reforming the waterfront. If other people have to pay their share they will do so, but our exports leave from the waterfront--</PARA>

<PARA>The need for the Government to ensure a flexible and efficient working environment on the Australian waterfront through lasting and genuine reforms, including the introduction of full enterprise employment, appropriate changes in union coverage and the elimination of restrictive work practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the need for lasting and genuine reform on the waterfront. We have taken the initiative on this matter. As Senator Gareth Evans pointed out, after two years of work the Inter-State Commission report is before Cabinet right now. At this moment Cabinet is considering the recommendations of the report and other matters. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is due to make a statement at the end of this week. Mr Willis has had extensive discussions with the parties in the waterfront industry. One might well ask-and we ask today-why the Opposition decides that there is some urgency about this matter when it knows very well that next week it can discuss the Government's reaction to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very concerned as to why the Opposition does things in this way. On 10 April, the last time we had a debate on this matter, the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) Council met to consider its reaction to the report. In other words, it had had the report for a few days and was considering it as a national body. Incidentally, I note that nine days after it had the report it gave its initial response to the Government. On 10 April the Opposition moved an urgency motion, and on that occasion the same sorts of things occurred as have occurred today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The attitude of the Opposition is reflected by the constant interjections of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He has been following the lead of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chaney. The Opposition wishes to change the world to an ideological framework that fits in with its preconceived ideas. It has great difficulty in dealing with the real world and, more particularly, with how it will change human beings in an industry so that people will have, in the words of the Opposition's motion, `lasting and genuine reforms'. That is what we are about. We know enough about this matter to know that if one intends to change people in an industry-and that means both the employers and the employees-one must have a process of cooperation. One must have agreed goals in order to change the situation that, in many cases, has existed over many years. In the case of the waterfront there have been many bitter years, which have left a residue of hatred and all sorts of lead in the saddlebags as far as reform is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having regard to that background, this Government is now moving to achieve change. We are seeking a solution. Mr Willis, the appropriate Minister, has met separately with employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and other people involved. He met separately with them on 14 April and on 28 April. There has been a continual process of discussion to this point. Senator Chaney finds this very offensive. When he opened the debate for the Opposition he talked about the Minister being locked away with unions and employers. What a terrible thing it is for the Minister now to start talking with employers and unions to get them finally to agree to various proposals! That process has been accelerated and there has been a great deal of agreement in principle on the major matters facing the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does Senator Chaney, when he leads for the Opposition, talk about `stomachs'? He gratuitously insulted Senator Gareth Evans and, in turn, other Ministers, by saying that they did not have the stomach to do certain things. This is the macho talk of the Opposition. This is the sort of `stand and deliver' type of attitude of political ideologues that certainly has no place in industry policy. It was worrying to see in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph that Mr Copeman, the endorsed New Right candidate for the Phillip electorate, praised Senator Chaney. It is almost as though Senator Chaney is changing his political position to become more macho and have the stomach to fight all and sundry in an ideological way, without being concerned about the actual needs of the waterfront industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the matters that have been referred to in the motion, one sees that full enterprise employment is mentioned. What is significant is that the Waterside Workers Federation has accepted in principle the question of industry employment. Industry-wide employment arrangements have existed in the stevedoring industry for several decades-and for good reason, as it ensures maximum flexibility and availability of labour in an industry which experiences dramatic daily fluctuations in its labour requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission proposed that the fluctuations be resolved by supplementary labour, which has been discussed between the parties and is a matter of controversy. I believe that the real hurdle to agreement was the proposal that the WWF relinquish its union coverage. This was a curious proposal, in my view. It is one that everybody seems to be concerned about. I have been informed that not one of the 280 submissions presented to the Inter-State Commission contains that proposal. It is no wonder that the ACTU, the State trades and labour councils and the Western Australian and Victorian governments support the Waterside Workers Federation's opposition to that proposal. I will not be surprised if the Government does not accept that recommendation. I would not believe for a moment that any government would accept all recommendations by a committee. I have looked carefully at the Opposition's motion. It refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . appropriate changes in union coverage . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A practical interpretation of `appropriate' would certainly make it acceptable to the trade union movement because nothing else would work. Secondly, I can see that, with amalgamations taking place throughout industry in the next three years, certain changes on the waterfront would be appropriate. I do not have any great problem with that. However, many members of the Opposition see it differently. They see change as an opportunity to destroy trade unionism on the waterfront. That, of course, would not be appropriate. It would be unacceptable, and it is not going to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Waterside Workers Federation and other unions have declared that they are prepared to negotiate a whole range of changes. Many things that, traditionally, have been difficult to achieve are going to be achieved. Tas Bull, referring in an article to rejuvenation of the industry, retraining and the extension of classifications having enabled the Federation to maintain the labour force at operational strength, lists the following as being necessary:</PARA>
<PARA> A training package designed to accommodate new recruits, support a career structure and provide increased skill acquisition and job flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Reclassification of jobs consistent with career structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Establishment of an industry training facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Company based productivity incentive schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Enforcement of the safety code in law. </PARA>
<PARA>These are some of the practical proposals that are very important for the establishment of an efficient industry. They have been agreed in principle by a wide cross-section of organisations: the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Port Waratah Stevedoring Company Pty Ltd, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the Australian Stevedoring Supervisors Association, the Australian Foreman Stevedores Association, the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union, the Federated Clerks Union, the National Union of Workers, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the Electrical Trades Union. That cross-section of people have come together and, in a spirit of cooperation, worked through the principles which, I hope, will apply to the waterfront in the future. No attempt by the Opposition can destroy this new commitment of people in the waterfront industry to modernise. Of course, we welcome that. There is no question but that the state of the waterfront is holding back the expansion of Australian industry. The work that the Government and the industry have done to attempt to change the practices and the organisation of work on the waterfront have been timely. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Opposition is under a general impression that it should be attacking people in industry. I suspect-though I hesitate to say it-that today Senator Chaney was almost repudiating Future Directions when he was challenged by Senator Evans. He is ambivalent even about the hidden agenda of Future Directions for the waterfront industry, which is use of essential services legislation. The program of the Opposition includes the introduction of essential services legislation. I hope that everyone listening to this debate will realise that that is a prescription for the destruction of all of this country's imports and exports. Essential services legislation means, implicitly, a confrontation on the waterfront and the strangulation of our exports and imports. That is the Opposition's manifesto in Future Directions, yet today Senator Chaney appeared to be relying on the Inter-State Commission's report. He is not quite prepared to acknowledge the essential services legislation proposal, which is the cornerstone of the Opposition's program for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, fits in with the Opposition's way of doing things-giving orders and standing over people. As Senator Evans said, the way to long-term, sustainable reform is by negotiated consensus, not by heavy-handed Government prescription. I should add that, in this case, neither is it by Opposition prescription, because the parties opposite will never get into Government and, thus, have the opportunity to implement those heavyhanded proposals. Every package of changes that the Government has implemented in respect of industry has been implemented by a process of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no short cuts if one wants a genuine change of attitudes and creation of the initiative that the Opposition has talked about. We have the runs on the board; the Opposition does not. Senator Evans read out a list of the many industries that have had the benefit of qualitative changes in their activities because of the cooperative approach that this Government has adopted. The Opposition would do the opposite if it were ever to gain office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the current and prospective economic climate, this urgency motion is of critical importance to the future of our nation. It covers the waterfront areas that need to be reformed. It refers to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need for the Government to ensure a flexible and efficient working environment on the waterfront through lasting and genuine reforms . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I was a bit surprised at the remarks of Senator Gareth Evans in his response to Senator Chaney. He kicked off by saying that reform of the waterfront was a major priority of the Hawke Government. However, he went on to say that, notwithstanding the report of the Inter-State Commission (ISC), cooperation and caution were needed. That gives me a feeling of apprehension. Following the report of the Inter-State Commission, it was reported that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself has signalled a reprieve for the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF), which was said to be facing oblivion through sweeping proposals aimed at waterfront reform. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is going to be possible to achieve through negotiation some significant reforms in a way which will not meet the understandable opposition of the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder we are apprehensive. Several senators have asked why such an urgency motion has been introduced at this time, as the Minister is scheduled to bring out a report on Wednesday. The answer is that we in Australia have on our hands an economic disaster, brought about by this Government. What we want to do is introduce a bit of spine into the Government so that something may be done. This country is an island continent. Trade, particularly exports, is vital to the prosperity of every Australian. The thrust of the motion is to encourage the Government to grasp the nettle and reform the waterfront, which, of course, is the Achilles heel of our export trade potential, so that unit costs may be reduced and, of equal or greater importance, so that we may restore our world reputation-a reputation that we have not had for many years-of reliability in the loading and unloading of goods. Our economy is in a parlous state, but the Government has a window of opportunity. It must act with urgency to effect a genuine and lasting substantial improvement in productivity, efficiency and reliability. Unit costs do not consist just of the hourly rate paid to those who work on the wharves, although those are not insignificant. I give a few examples of hourly rates to the Senate. The gross wage for a waterfront worker in the port of Brisbane working 41.3 hours a week is $998 a week. If that is extrapolated for 52 weeks, it is $52,000 a year. A foreman working 41 hours earns $63,336 per annum; a tradesman working 52 hours earns $66,716 per annum; and a supervisor working 47 hours receives $96,200 per annum. I do not want to detract from the thrust of this urgency motion by zeroing in on wages. As I have said many times in this place, I would be happy to accept those wages if we could get rid of the other things associated with the malpractice, the featherbedding and so on, on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The speed and efficiency at which incoming vessels can be berthed, unloaded, loaded and dispatched to their destination is of paramount importance. Archaic work practices and phoney safety issues which cause delays for political reasons must be buried. In the past in this place I have given a list of those sorts of things; I do not think I have to go through them again. There is a litany of these sorts of things. My colleagues Senator Brownhill and Senator Chaney mentioned a few of them. These anti-Australian activities-and I mean anti-Australian activities-not only enhance our unenviable reputation as an unrealiable supplier but also in themselves are the major contributor to unit costs which end up being paid for by Australian exporters or Australian consumers. They are the people who pay. Because of these contrived delays-no-one at all would object to proper safety issues-it is not unusual, for instance, for manufactured goods destined for export not to be loaded and for the ship to leave without its cargo. Sometimes imported capital equipment for our manufacturing industry, which is not unloaded because of time constraints and ongoing demurrage charges further down the shipping line, ends up in a place such as Singapore and eventually finds its way back to Australia. Any shipping agent will tell the same stories; those practices are going on today. </PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of practices are totally inexcusable and unacceptable under any circumstances and reflect the mess on our waterfront. There is a group in London called the strike club. Most shippers contribute money into the strike club. Australia's lack of reliability is graphically illustrated by the annual strike club figures compiled by the Shipowners Mutual Strike Insurance Association of London. The strike club measures the percentage of claims for losses incurred by strikes in various countries throughout the world. Australia topped the strike club charts from 1982 to 1987, accounting for a whopping 42.73 per cent of all strike insurance claims received by the Association. Canada ranked a distant second with 19.5 per cent of the claims for the same period. What a reputation we have! As I mentioned earlier, the political reasons for the disputes are phoney. If one looks at the monthly figures, one finds that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the strikes in the Port of Sydney are because the unions involved do not like the policies of the South African Government. What has that got to do with the shipping of goods in and out of the port?</PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission has carried out an extensive and, as Senator Chaney said, apolitical study. Its recommendations must be implemented in full if we are to clean up the mess. There can be no watering down. For the sake of Australia, the Government must take this on board. Partial implementation will be an absolute failure at, yet again, great expense to the taxpayer. We agree that subsidies should be given for the redundancies of people who should retire, but that will be at great cost to all Australians. These are the hidden costs. When the air traffic controllers go on strike we know about it because so many people are affected. But ordinary people do not see the hidden costs to them individually of the waterfront practices. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Chaney said, the Opposition has stated that it will give bipartisan support to the Government if it has the character and intestinal fortitude to implement the recommendations of the ISC in full as a matter of urgency. The economic position of Australia is so desperate in this country that for the Government not to do so would be an act of treachery to the nation. We are not alone in talking about the desperate economic situation in Australia. Last Friday Senator Button said in this chamber in answer to a question. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian economy is in a very serious position. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators on the other side were running around the place saying, `How are we going to stop the press from picking it up?'. But Senator Button recognised what the rest of Australia recognises. Our concern is that the Government will not take action. All the signs are there. They have come out in remarks made by Senator Evans and Senator Childs. Anyone with any knowledge of the industry will be aware of the intense nature of the negotiations over the past two weeks between employers and employees with both the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, and senior officers of his Department. Everyone with any idea of the industry is also aware of the veiled and not so veiled threats by the Government for employers to capitulate to union intransigency in critical areas which, if agreed, would gut the ISC recommendations. Those areas are labour pooling, casual employment in peak periods-in other words, allowing stevedores to employ casual labour in peak periods-union coverage in small ports and container depots, and the contracting out of maintenance work. There are now newspaper reports that these intense negotiations were not negotiations at all but consultations. That is the terminology. Anyone with a smattering of knowledge of the industry-I am sure that Senator Childs is aware of it-knows how intense they were, but they are now `consultations'. Notwithstanding initial adverse comments made by Mr Kelty of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Mr Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation and a statement made last week by Mr John Coombs, assistant secretary of the WWF, that they would `never budge' from the critical areas I have just mentioned, we are still expected to believe that a meaningful statement will be made next Wednesday. How can we believe that after the comments made by both Senator Evans and Senator Childs that have been leaked to the newspapers?</PARA>
<PARA> The economic situation in Australia is so serious and desperate that we cannot afford any further delays. If there are further delays, we will continue the decline down the slippery slide and become what the Treasurer, Mr Keating, referred to some years ago as a banana republic. We cannot afford any watering down of key reforms which must be carried out if we are not to become an island in a sea of Asian prosperity. I believe that language was used by the Prime Minister when giving gratuitous advice to and describing the future of Vietnam in recent months. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he looks in his own backyard. </PARA>
<PARA> For a country with our inherent wealth, the size of our gross foreign debt, our net foreign debt, interest rates on housing at 17 per cent and prime interest rates at 19.5 per cent is an absolute disgrace. It is a disgrace that the standards of living of all Australians, particularly of families, are at grave risk. The Treasurer talked about pulling levers, but the only lever he has pulled is the monetary lever to jack up interest rates in an attempt to stifle consumption. It would not be a problem if that consumption spending was on Australian manufactured goods. The simple reason why it is not being spent on Australian manufactured goods is that we can no longer compete. We are not manufacturing the goods and services that people wish to purchase. The old story that goods come from countries where labour is cheap no longer holds water. As most honourable senators would know, the average wage in Japan is $45,000 a year. Of course, we must export more and import less. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of our manufacturing industries which are competitive on the domestic market are not necessarily competitive on the export market. They have to run the gauntlet of high port costs and the infamous reputation we have for unreliability. That is the key thing, the unreliability. Compared to many of our competitors we are of course a long way from the major markets of the United States of America and Europe. Because we suffer the tyranny of distance-and I think we all recognise this, being a long way from those markets-our aim must be to make our ports not only equivalent in performance and cost to our competitors, but infinitely better. That has got to be the aim. Every Australian should be aiming to be the best in what he does. Reform on the waterfront is not the only area of micro-economic reform needed to get our country back on track, but I submit it is a vital start. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the last speaker on this urgency motion, I have had an opportunity to listen to the contributions by all speakers and particularly those from the Opposition, which moved this motion. Although the motion is couched in general terms to start off with which no-one can argue with-everyone wants a flexible and efficient working environment on our waterfront-it goes on to specifics. It depends on how one interprets the word `appropriate'; whether one includes the interpretation of `including the introduction of full enterprise employment' as in the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report or whether it is what the Opposition wants, which is basically a union bashing exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The criticisms of Senator Chaney, Senator Brownhill and Senator Parer were overwhelmingly directed at the unions involved on the waterfront. Yet when one reads large sections of the Inter-State Commission report and hears the evidence put before it, one should say that, although criticism can be made of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, there was also plenty of criticism levelled at the operation of the stevedoring employers and the way that they have operated and allowed inefficiencies to grow within the industry over the last 20 years. As I say, although one cannot argue with the general sentiments, especially in the first section of the motion, it is clear that this motion was put up, firstly, to bash the unions and, secondly, to get something on the record from the Opposition before the Government introduces and announces its package of reform this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis can complain and bluff and interject over there, but it is very true that that was the reason why this motion was introduced into the Senate today. We have to look at the record of the coalition partners over 30 of the last 40 years when they were in government. It is all very well for the Opposition to get up here and say that this or that is not good enough, that the Government is not acting fast enough or is not tough enough, but what was its record in 30 of the last 40 years of government? Nothing, utterly nothing, in micro-economic reform. It ducked, it weaved, it always avoided the issue unless it was fixing up some little rort to protect some of its mates in business and so on, but there was no comprehensive plan. Overwhelmingly the problems of Australian manufacturing industry come from the policies adopted by the coalition during the 1950s and 1960s, and it is another sorry example of the Liberal Party giving away to the McEwen views about overt protection, high protection, which in the end did not protect jobs, it just led to extremely inefficient industries which eventually cost workers some of their jobs. That was the role of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since we have been in government we have had a record of which all Australians can be proud, and certainly of which the Labor Party of Australia is very proud. We have reformed and saved the steel industry from collapse. In 1983 it was at death's door. I know that the steel industry in Whyalla in my home State was in an extremely parlous position. The steel industry plan introduced by Senator Button in 1983 lasted just over five years. It saved the steel industry. Certainly there were job losses, but there was certainly major investment and now our steel industry is competitive with the rest of the world. It has export markets as well as supplying our own market in Australia. There is a long term future for that industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same with the car industry, despite a lot of criticism. If we had stayed where we were, under the policies of the previous Government, the car industry would now be in a pretty sorry state. The car industry in my home State of South Australia has been rejuvenated, with major reinvestment and now long term job security offered to the workers in that industry. There has also been micro-economic reform in the heavy engineering industry and in the textile, clothing and footwear industries, all areas which the previous Government was not game to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major area of micro-economic reform is the wheat industry. When we move to deregulate some parts of the domestic market to make it more efficient, to offer better returns, more flexibility to growers, we have this extraordinary saga on the other side of people falling on each other, trying to oppose these changes. When we announced that we were going to deregulate the handling and transport industry, in accordance with the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, we again got statements from various people opposite that this is a terrible thing and that this is going to affect employment in a particular country town. We get threats made to us by the Government of New South Wales that it will not go along with it, and so on. So when the Government has bitten the bullet and introduced a large number of these micro-economic reforms, there has always been carping criticism opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously everybody agrees on the waterfront and maritime industry area. If honourable senator opposite would actually read some of the material produced by the unions in the maritime and waterfront area they would find out that they themselves overwhelmingly agree that there has to be substantial change and reform in their industry. They know it because, if there is not, they will not have any jobs in that area in the future, as the industry will go into continual decline. Although both major unions in the waterfront and maritime area, that is, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Seamen's Union of Australia, have made criticisms of the Government reports that have come down, and have made submissions saying that they will not accept particular parts of those reforms and the suggested changes, they do not walk away from the fact that there has to be significant change in their industry. I think great credit should be given to the Seamen's Union for negotiating with employers for a plan for a substantial orderly reduction of manning rates of Australian ships. When we came into office ships had a crew of up to 37; by 1992 it will be down as low as 16 and maybe even 14. That will make our coastal shipping costs equivalent to the costs of other comparable countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. I know honourable senators opposite would rather us have conditions on our ships equivalent to what would be on a Filipino ship or a Panamanian registered ship-terrible conditions, no safety regulations and so on. But the Seamen's Union has bitten the bullet, and even though it is going to cost it a lot of members, it realises that need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator says that it had no choice. But it did not turn its back on the situation. It accepted that there had to be changes. We now come to the recommendations of the ISC. I would like to put on the record the following from page 2 of its summary, under the section headed `The need for change'. I have yet to hear anybody from the Waterside Workers Federation or the union movement disagree with the need for change. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The second-round evidence and the further studies confirmed the fact that the waterfront industry is in urgent need of fundamental change. As the Commission observed in its preliminary findings, the industry displays the classic symptoms of an imperfect market:</PARA>
<PARA> ineffective management;</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention from honourable senators opposite about the problems of inefficient management. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> poor work force training and career arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention from the Opposition's remarks today about those matters. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>introspective industrial attitudes;</PARA>
<PARA>poor response to user needs;</PARA>
<PARA>poor information flows to users and between links in the transport chain;</PARA>
<PARA>lack of supply and demand balance, often reflected in congestion and queues or in under-utilisation of expensive facilities;</PARA>
<PARA>diffusion of governmental responsibility;</PARA>
<PARA>abuse of monopoly power, reflected particularly in port authority pricing and investment policies;</PARA>
<PARA>a tendency for matters to improve considerably while they are under investigation but to lapse once the pressure is removed;</PARA>
<PARA>To this litany can be added high costs, endemic unreliability, a high level of industrial disputation, inappropriate manning levels and work practices, poor discipline, poor motivation throughout the industry, and a pervasive lack of competition. The Commission's proposed plan attempts to address the underlying causes of these problems and to provide a sound basis for long-term structural change. </PARA>
<PARA>That outlines succinctly what the Government will be dealing with when it brings down its report later this week based on the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report. In the 30 years that the Opposition was in government no such report was ever forthcoming. The only change that took place was in the late 1960s when an agreement was reached between the employees and employers over changes needed in the industry. In 1965 the industry had 26,000 members on the waterfront. There are now 6,000 employees. Obviously there are to be further reductions and this report which the Government is dealing with is tackling that question. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition should at least have the good grace from time to time not always to belt the trade unions but to give them credit for the attitudinal changes they have made. I draw the attention of Senator Parer, in particular, to a document put out by the Waterside Workers Federation called `An industry in need of rejuvenation'. It makes it clear that it disagrees with some parts of the IAC report. After reading it we see it is willing to tackle in a large number of areas substantial change in its own industry. There has been a big change in trade unions in Australia over the last 10 years. They have been willing to tackle the need for change. Only a Labor government has the ability to deal with these changes and to work with the trade unions to achieve substantial change. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by giving an example of why I and this Government support major changes to our maritime and waterfront industries. Several weeks ago I was a member of a parliamentary delegation to New Zealand. While I was there I was at an official luncheon and sat next to the New Zealand Manager for General Motors-Holden's Ltd in that country. He explained to me that business was going very well in New Zealand. It was importing up to 500 cars a month from Australia, either in a fully assembled form or in parts ready to be assembled. He said that business was so good he would have thought they could have sold between 900 and 1,200 cars a month. I asked him why he could not. He said, `Obviously there is a boom in Australia at the moment and we cannot automatically get the orders we want from our own manufacturer. That could be overcome'. The biggest problem was in the availability of shipping to get the cars across the Tasman. I urge the Government to deal with the problem of the trans-Tasman shipping arrangements. That cannot go on under closer economic relations. There has to be a much more open and efficient system. Quite bluntly, it is costing jobs in the car industry in South Australia, my home State. If it could produce all the cars that were demanded in New Zealand it would mean more jobs at General Motors-Holden's Ltd in South Australia. That would be a great boon to employment, particularly in Elizabeth, for General Motors-Holden's. </PARA>
<PARA> When I got back I spoke to General Motors-Holden's about its problem and received further information about the difficulties it has. For example, it cannot get ships to come to Adelaide, with its own container port, to load. It has to put them on the train to Melbourne. That is an arrangement the ship owners will not change, despite much pleading from General Motors-Holden's. When it gets the cars to Melbourne there is no guarantee that all the cars on the wharf will be loaded on to the ship. There can be changes at the last moment with these arrangements. It was very frustrating for General Motors-Holden's that it could not achieve the full marketing potential of its product. It received information within Australia about some of the difficulties experienced when using rail and road transport. For example, a train load of cars was sent from Elizabeth to Sydney. After two weeks several of the train carriages of cars had not turned up. Someone on the New South Wales railway had diverted the train into a siding at Broken Hill and left the carriages there for two or three weeks. It made the customers in New South Wales a little upset, having paid for the cars and finding they had not arrived. Those sorts of things need to be addressed. We are going to address them. </PARA>
<PARA> It ill becomes the Opposition to put this motion forward and to criticise us for not doing enough when it had 30 years to do something and did nothing. In the last six years we have tackled micro-economic reform in a large number of areas and are continuing to do so. We have the guts to do it; the Opposition does not. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Government to ensure a flexible and efficient working environment on the Australian waterfront through lasting and genuine reforms, including the introduction of full enterprise employment, appropriate changes in union coverage and the elimination of restrictive work practices. </PARA>
<PARA>That motion in its terms is not in any sense critical of the Government. Rather, it is a suggestion from this Senate as to what is required of the Government. It is a good thing that the Senate should be putting this forward at this time because, as Senator Evans said in his contribution to the debate, in a few days the Government will make an announcement on this vital area for reform. In the broad, the reforms which are being put forward by the Opposition represent the reforms which have been advocated by the Inter-State Commission. As I said when opening the debate, we would wish to go further than the Commission in a number of respects. We believe the Commission's recommendations represent a very worthwhile reform package that we would support. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated in my contribution to the debate that we offered last week, in a statement I made on behalf of the Opposition, the cooperation of the Opposition in implementing the Inter-State Commission report. That in some peculiar way was described by Senator Evans and Senator Schacht as confrontationist. I find that quite extraordinary. The explanation for their somewhat extraordinary contributions to the debate is, essentially, that they were being defensive. They were taking the view that the best form of defence is offence. They were trying to get over the embarrassment they have that there has been real doubt, and continues to be real doubt, that fundamental reform will be effected by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Why bring forward the motion when there is a report and the Government has yet to announce a decision? The reason for that is plain when we look at the response of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to the report (ACTU). The ACTU actually defended defence by the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) of the coverage it has which leads to a good deal of inefficiency. I gave a quite specific example of loading and unloading containers. Those containers which are loaded using Waterside Workers Federation labour cost a good deal more than those which are loaded by the Transport Workers Union and the Federated Storemen and Packers Union, which are involved in different depots. In turn, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) reassured the Waterside Workers Federation with respect to its concerns about coverage. The public is entitled to be worried about the prospect that the Government is going to squib on reform of this vital area just because one element of the trade union movement, the Waterside Workers Federation, has set itself against change in some vital areas and has the support of the ACTU. The irony is that the ACTU is supporting the WWF, which in this respect is in conflict with other unions which are competing for the work. It will be a pity if the less efficient outcome is allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is common ground that this industry is costing Australia in excess of $600m. There is waste which is variously estimated at $650m through to in excess of $1 billion. In a country where we have interest rates of 17 per cent, where home buyers cannot afford to buy houses and where young married Australians are being told that if they wish to buy a house they will have to postpone childbearing by 10 years, it is urgent that the Government tackle these areas of waste and inefficiency instead of turning a debate on a serious subject, as we have seen today, into a name-calling and slanging match. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, as Senator Schacht has said, that there has been some progress in sectors of the trade union movement. It remains true that some sectors of the trade union movement, like some employers, will protect their vested interests against the public interest. We stand for the public interest and we call on the Government to make the reforms that are reflected in this motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report relating to the Housing Assistance Act 1984 shows that in the last financial year $705m was paid from the Commonwealth Government to the States to provide for housing in the Australian community. The report shows at page 139, for example, that the number of public rental housing dwellings completed in 1987-88 was significant. My State of South Australia, with the fifth largest population in this country, completed the second largest number of public rental dwellings. It was second only to New South Wales, where 1,351 public rental dwellings were completed. In South Australia, the fifth most populous State, 1,114 dwellings were completed, the second largest total in Australia. That is consistent with the stock of public rental dwellings as at the end of June 1988, but South Australia with 60,600 public rental dwellings in the hands of the South Australian Housing Trust made that State number two in the total of such dwellings in this country. I emphasise that South Australia with the fifth largest population has the second largest public housing authority stock of dwellings in this nation. In fact, it has more public rental dwellings than the State of Victoria, which has three times the population of South Australia. It shows the commitment to public housing in South Australia over the years. It shows how Federal and State policies can operate together to create housing for low income families in one State of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years since this Government has been in office the amount of funding for public housing has gone 20 per cent ahead of inflationary costs in the community-in other words, there has been 20 per cent real growth in public housing allocations in Australia. This compares with the position during the last five years of the Liberal Government when there was a 34 per cent reduction, in real terms, in public housing allocations. Completions of public rental houses in the past five years have amounted to 215,000, compared with a mere 165,000 under the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been dealing today with interest rates and the impact on housing of the cost of finance, but it is a fact that in the last months of the Fraser Government the Liberals showed their priorities by not even having a housing Minister. In 1983 the Hawke Government appointed Mr Chris Hurford as its Minister for Housing. We now have Mr Peter Staples as our Minister for Housing-in stark contrast to the Liberals, who did not designate such a person during their latter years in office. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 12 months of the Fraser Government there were a mere 105,000 housing commencements in Australia. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, which is an independent body, has forecast that in the current financial year 168,000 new dwellings will be commenced. That is a 60 per cent increase over the record of the Fraser Government in the earlier years of this decade. This increase is occurring despite the high interest rates we have heard about today and on Friday from honourable senators opposite. They have been very vocal about the alleged impact of high interest rates on the housing sector, but the reality is that in the current financial year the Indicative Planning Council forecasts 168,000 housing starts compared with a mere 105,000 under the Liberals. Even with those high interest rates, the Indicative Planning Council is saying that next year there will be 140,000 to 144,000 housing starts-a significant increase on the achievements of the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The key part of our housing policy has been the first home owners scheme, a scheme to provide grants to new home owners. It is an income tested scheme, a targeted measure which aims housing funds at those people who need them most. I am pleased to note that since its introduction in 1983, more than 320,000 Australian families have been helped into their own homes at a cost of $1,400m. That is the key reason why there has been a big increase in the number of housing commencements in Australia over the past five years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report on the Housing Assistance Act 1984 reveals once again a major problem affecting so many Australian families. It shows, for example, that there were 195,370 Australian households on public housing waiting lists and, although there was, in most States, a marginal decline in the last 12 months, there was a substantial increase in New South Wales. Overall, the problem of housing is obviously one that establishes what really is happening to the standard of living in Australia. I believe that there is nothing more fundamental to a family's well-being than its capacity to be well and adequately housed, particularly in a society such as ours where, theoretically, there should be very little evidence of real poverty if people are given the opportunity of a fair go. We wonder what the Government is doing about providing that fair go. We wonder why it has set about deliberately relying on massive high interest rates as its only weapon in the economic battle in Australia, a weapon which is aimed directly at those Australians seeking to own their own homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well to talk about how people will depend more and more on public housing, but the fact is that if interest rates were far lower than they are the demand for public housing would be far less than it is, and the capacity of people who have improved their economic status, since receiving public housing, to buy public housing, and thereby release more money to provide more housing for those in need, would be greater. That seems to be the sort of direction in which we should be moving. It is the direction in which this Government is not moving. This Government is doing everything it can to push housing out of the reach of ordinary Australians. What chance has a public housing tenant got of being able to afford the massive interest bill that now will be upon him if he were to try to buy a house?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government is forcing more and more Australians into tenancy or into dependency on public housing. There are those people who say that that suits this Government's philosophic book, that it does not want Australians to be what were once described by a Labor Minister as `the petty capitalists who own their own houses'. This Government's massive interest rate policy is bringing about that disastrous reversal from the traditional situation that existed, certainly under coalition governments, where not only the great bulk of Australians owned their own houses or were paying them off but also it was regarded as the right of all Australians to do that. It was part of their expected and accepted standard of living to be able to aspire to and achieve home ownership. The latest rise in interest rates to 17 per cent, with the prospect of another rise to 18 per cent, on housing mortgages, is absolutely disastrous. We have seen press reports that suggest that the minimum income one needs in order to qualify to buy an average Sydney home-to meet the mortgage payments-is something like $65,000 a year. Let us face it: what hope do young people, newly married people, young families, have of getting that kind of income? Yet if they do not, as a direct result of this Government's economic policies, they are expelled from the housing market. They are removed from any prospect of being able to own their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Less than a year ago the interest rate for a housing mortgage was 13 1/2 per cent. It is now 17 per cent, which is an increase of something like $2,800 a year on an average Sydney mortgage. It means that something like $56 a week extra is needed to meet the mortgage payments. Yet this Government is talking about tax cuts. Tax cuts will be only a tiny proportion of the huge increased interest bill being imposed upon Australians by this Government's high interest rate policy, a policy to which we have objected in the past and to which we will continue to object. We will continue to tell this Government that it must solve its problems by taking fiscal measures, by cutting its own spending, and not by hitting people who need housing in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing indicates the poverty of the economic policies of this Government more than what is happening in the housing area and some of the statistics which appear in the annual report on the Housing Assistance Act 1984. The report indicates, amongst other things, that around 40,000 people in Australia sleep out of doors and in refuges each night and that another 60,000 live on the verge of homelessness. As Senator Michael Baume pointed out a moment ago, 195,000 Australian households were on public housing waiting lists. The report points out that 14.5 per cent, or 762,000 income units, were in after-housing poverty in 1986-in other words, one in seven people, after they had paid for their housing, lived in poverty. Of those 762,000 income units 390,000, or approximately 50 per cent, were income units with dependent children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have indicated on many previous occasions, the policy being pursued by this Government of growth for growth's sake lies fundamentally at the base of the housing problems which people experience in their everyday lives. The same applies to the in- ability of this Government to address properly the environmental problems that we face. I have pointed before to the fact that the gross domestic product has grown 2 1/4 times since the Second World War but, quite clearly, with respect to housing, we are not 2 1/4 times better off. In recent months, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, has called for a substantial increase in the population of this country. He has called for an increase in population to 20 million by the year 2000. In other words, he wants a 25 per cent increase in population in only 10 years-that is, to add the present population of Adelaide to the present population of Sydney. Clearly, the amount of land in the Sydney area is limited. In a deregulated market, such an enormous increase in population can only lead to a substantial increase in the price of houses and land and, when we add to that a deregulated money market, it leads to an increase in the price of money and to high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the defects in this growth-oriented economy in which we live is that very often we are counting the costs of that growth as benefits. Those people who are forced to live on the outskirts of already large cities such as Sydney find in their everyday lives that it is costing them more for travel and all those services which serve their housing needs. All those costs which they bear go down as additions to gross domestic product and are, therefore, counted in the national accounts as benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, through its deregulatory policy, is left with little else but forcing the price of money up-in other words, increasing the interest rates-as a way of controlling the economy. I would like to know from honourable senators on the Government side how those people who are building houses in Australia, using Australian materials and Australian labour, are adding to our foreign debt, and how cutting down the ability of those people to have houses will in any way impact on our foreign indebtedness. Under this program this Government, because of its need to channel money from the poor to the rich, has reintroduced negative gearing. Quite clearly, this impacts most severely on those who are not able to invest in housing and therefore must pay for the housing in which they live at very high rates of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: this Government's economic policy cannot address the fundamental problems which underlie the economic difficulties in which we find ourselves. Those difficulties are being expressed in the difficulty that ordinary people have in getting housing and in this Government's inability to address the very severe and growing environmental problems which this country faces. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I am most interested to see the size of this document entitled Department of Administrative Service: External Consultants 1987-88 which has been tabled this afternoon. It is some several inches thick and it concerns external consultants employed by the Department of Administrative Services between 1987 and 1988 with an expenditure of some $70m. I am interested to see it for two reasons: first, under the guidelines of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), pursuant to the Public Service Act, it is a requirement that departments publish particulars of these consultants as part of their annual reports. It is significant to say at this stage that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is holding an inquiry into the annual reports of departments because two-thirds of all government departments-that is, secretaries to departments-although strictly required to include certain material in annual reports, have failed to so do. Indeed, they have been written to by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet asking them to comply with the guidelines. The Committee has written to people and asked them to comply, and not even one response has been forthcoming. Consequently, this morning the Committee began its inquiry and has had the advantage of having Mr Codd, Dr Keating and others appear before it to be asked why the guidelines have not been complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a significant matter because the total amount for procurement of goods and services in Australia annually is some $8 billion. There are some 3,500 people involved in spending that $8 billion. Here is a document accounting for $70m alone. The items included are diverse. There is a payment to a Mr Keddie, who is a consultant physiotherapist, for $90. He is being used by the Australian Construction Service central office because of a lack of in-house expertise. I find that curious. Then we go to something which is perhaps a correct use of consultants' skills. There was a need to assess the local wind and wave statistics at the submarine wharf, at a cost of $12,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As I go through the various items-as I said, the expenditure can range from $90 all the way through to over $100,000-what interests me is that under the Finance Regulations pursuant to the Audit Act there is a requirement that any expenditure in excess of $20,000-it was previously $10,000-requires a department to use the public tendering system. There is a provision under section 52aa (2) of the Finance Regulations to get an exemption from that procedure by getting a certificate from the Secretary to the Department of Finance. Similarly, there is a list of exempt categories where people may get expressions of interest and get quotes without going through the full tendering process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee has discerned that this requirement is observed rather in the breach than in the observance. So I would be most interested to know what percentage of this vast expenditure of some $70m has indeed met with the Finance Regulations or has been in breach. Many departments that have appeared before us have honoured this requirement in the breach rather than in the observance. It is a very serious matter because at a time when we are all speaking about letting the managers manage and asking for more efficiency in the Public Service there is an inability to comply with the law as it presently is. I think it is important that the Senate's attention be drawn to the fact that, if we are to see the Parliament being properly informed about the expenditure of public moneys which are meant to be for and on behalf of the public good, accountability needs to be stressed to both secretaries of departments and operatives within them. As I said, $8 billion is a lot of money to spend annually. This report alone represents $70m worth of expenditure. We do not know whether it has met with the requirements or whether those requirements have been honoured in the breach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to talk to this paper entitled Department of Administrative Service: External Consultants 1987-88. I certainly have no problems with the Department of Administrative Services, or the Government in general, getting the best advice and assistance it can get rather than trying to do everything in-house. I assume that that is the reason behind what appear to be substantial payments. For example, Colliers International Property Consultants Pty Ltd received a payment of $226,461 to assist the Government to dispose of the Commonwealth Centre in Sydney. It was not just a question of Hawkie ringing up Bondy and saying, `Do you want to buy my building?'. In fact, over $200,000 was spent on that matter. There is a great deal of merit in using professional people to assist the Government to act professionally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, some payments do interest me. For example, the Department of Administrative Services parliamentary services and information group paid $32,000 to Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd (ANOP)-Mr Rod Cameron's company-for qualitative market research on the Australia Card. I do not think anyone in this chamber is unaware of the fact that Rod Cameron is a very close campaign adviser to the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party and the Government have a real duty to ensure that employment of people as close to them as this on such sensitive political matters as the Australia Card should be treated with far greater care than seems to have been the case here. It seems to me that this is really using $32,000 of Government money to get ANOP to provide what is simply political information to the Labor Party in fighting its campaign for the `Un-Australia Card', which fortunately was successfully resisted. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of other payments interest me. For example, I see that Harry Seidler has gone fairly down market. I see he got paid $41,850 to provide a food service kiosk at Garden Island. I did not know that Mr Seidler's architecture firm was getting into food kiosks, particularly at such up-market places as Garden Island Dockyard. </PARA>
<PARA> On a much larger scale, there is no doubt that our representation overseas is costing a large amount of money in the way of architects' consultancy fees. On all the activity in Tokyo we lost something like $48m because of incompetence on foreign exchange. I mention that in passing. In the last financial year, an architectural firm involved with the redevelopment program in Tokyo was paid $2.9m. I do not know how big a task it has been but $2.9m is obviously a fairly large expenditure. Another $961,000 went to quantity surveyors, so that the total is almost $4m. Legal services took another $420,000 and various real estate advice cost $240,000. The Tokyo Embassy will cost an awful lot of money before a brick is laid. </PARA>
<PARA> In Beijing, the design and supervising architects received $1.9m last year. I do not necessarily criticise that expenditure. I believe that the people of Australia have every right to know it and I am glad that this report comes out. The people have every right to know where the money is going and whether that is what appeals to them. Another $19,456 was spent on redeveloping plans for the Anzac Rifle Range. I hoped they might have decided not to go ahead with that. Anyone who wants to read hundreds of pages of incredibly boring statistics will find some interesting examples of where this Government is spending his money. One can only hope that part of the Government's policy will be to reduce government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA>Exemptions from IBM. Grounds for exemptions are solutions from the contract, which after consultation with IBM are clearly unsuitable in terms of functionality, or time, or in terms of cost when considered in the context of the total costs of the project, as distinct from the price of the equipment. In these circumstances it will be necessary for the project manager to consult with IBM and would need a case demonstrating clear unsuitability of the IBM solution to warrant a non IBM solution. IBM agreement to this case should be sought although in unusual circumstances Defence might find cause to opt for a non IBM solution without IBM agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the Minister's statement before dinner, that IBM Australia Ltd had no veto, or words to that effect, would not the advice which he received before dinner have to be considered to be quite inaccurate in the light of this quotation from this document of 12 April, `IBM agreement . . . should be sought although in unusual circumstances Defence might find cause to opt for a non-IBM solution without IBM agreement'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can we debate the submarines a little later on? I am having enough trouble with the computers before I hit the submarines. On the question of the computers, I think we have to re-emphasise that this system was put to tender, and IBM won it. There cannot be any question about the tender system. It was open, it was above board and IBM won. Since it has won, the honourable senator is now querying not only its right to have won, but also the Government's right to negotiate with it after it has won. I cannot quite understand how she gets around to doing that. It has got every right now to insist on the contract with it being met.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer. Of course I have a number of queries, and I would query the wisdom first of all of putting such a large contract into one package which, I believe, will be very difficult for the Department to administer effectively. I question the need for the compatibility or the interoperability of so many systems throughout the Department. The existing arrangements are not necessarily disadvantageous. I question the special privileged position which IBM will achieve five years down the track when other tenderers might wish to try again for a tender with the Department. IBM will be very clearly in the box seat for any extension of the contractual arrangements. In the meantime, I also query the additional cost to the Commonwealth, as I believe it will be quite massive, instead of upgrading existing equipment within the Department, requiring it to be brought into the DESINE system. So there are a number of quite serious concerns which the Minister should recognise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My next question relates to new technology. In the Estimates Committee hearing I asked whether the Department agreed that new technology must be acquired through open tendering to achieve the most competitive price for the taxpayer. This is another very real concern as to how the Department will in fact acquire new technology along the way. I understand that vendors are being told that new technology not anticipated by the DESINE request for tender will automatically be included in the DESINE contract and supplied by IBM. Just how is one going to get competitive prices unless one can put to tender for specific systems? I think the Department's answer to this was very evasive. I would like the Minister to give the chamber an assurance that new technology will be acquired by the Department through competitive tenders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I can give that guarantee. We have to go back to the contract that has been negotiated with IBM. That does allow for future technologies to be included, provided of course they conform with DESINE. So I do not know how I can give a further undertaking other than that. But I want to comment on some of the matters that the honourable senator has raised. If she is looking at benefit to the Government, this tender process and its evaluation were very thorough. It conformed with the processes that were outlined by the Department of Administrative Services. The local content elements of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that are insisted upon in these negotiations were looked at very thoroughly. At the end of all this it was the view that IBM was a clear and convincing winner. We must go back to that as the basis for the Government's actions since then. Obviously some of the companies that did not win, some of those that were on the outside looking in-I will not use President Johnson's analogy-have obviously been questioning the scope of the philosophy in the first place and its implementation. There is a suggestion that some of those companies are offering artificially low prices in a bid to undermine the original contract. Whatever is done from now on, however, obviously the Government will not be in a position to accept anything which would undermine the philosophy behind the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that the Minister is skirting around the matters I raised. I thought he was going to come to grips with the serious questions I raised. If he is unable to do that I will move on to the question of new technology because he did not come to grips with that either. I am talking about the constant and racing new developments that are occurring in this area and from which the Department is ready to shut itself off because of the necessity to be tied into one firm. The question of upgrading existing equipment will mean that there will be no requirement for the Department to look for the newest technology because of being tied in to IBM. I would like it clearly on the record that the Minister not able to give me an assurance that new technology would be acquired and that it would be through competitive tenders. It would be done through this backdoor arrangement, with IBM being chatted up to see what it has to say about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question relates to contract software and the area we covered earlier with Senator Watson when we established that there is a difficulty for companies other than IBM to gain contracts for supply if IBM says it has the ability to supply. I take the Minister directly to the supply system redevelopment project, particularly to the expressions of interest which were sought in July last year. I take the Minister more particularly to the trials which will begin next Monday for the three companies which have been distilled from the people who originally showed expressions of interest. They will be going through a fortnight's trial at very great expense to them so see whether they may be eligible for software contracts. This work, in terms of value to an Australian company as distinct from an overseas company, could be worth some $20m. We are not talking about peanuts. We are talking about the problem where, under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce guidelines, with partnerships for development and offsets-I believe IBM is a partner-we are supposed to see spin-offs and benefits for the Australian economy and Australian development as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the way this contract is structured means that the bias is in favour of imported software and not indigenous software. I would very much like to hear the Minister's comments on what might transpire, whichever of these three companies is successful, at the end of the two week trial. It is open to IBM to say that one or other of the successful people simply do not fit with its architecture and effectively to veto that company being given the work. I would enjoy hearing the Minister's comments. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The major elements were a variety of equipments for Navy adding to an estimated $15m. The remainder was for Air Force for the RAAF Standard Word and Administrative Processing System (RSWAPS) project. This included hardware, software, one year of maintenance and training. Further detail can be provided, however this will take time and some information may be difficult to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 108, Supplementary 1</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Department provide detailed figures for the value of the current investments for the major Defence applications? Based on the Department's evidence at the PAC, these should run into hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> This information has definitional problems (eg for computer systems that are part of other systems) and methodological problems (eg replacement value versus historical cost valuation) and would take considerable effort and time to provide. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 109, Supplementary 1</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has stated that project cost can provide grounds for exemption under DESINE. Can the Minister tell me what this means?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> If the project cost, including a DESINE element and also the increment for integrating that element into the project, is excessive compared to that project not containing a DESINE solution, this would be grounds for an exemption. Factors taken into account include:</PARA>
<PARA>commonality with equipment in service</PARA>
<PARA>technical capabilities</PARA>
<PARA>degree of confidence in assessments-risk</PARA>
<PARA>ANZ content</PARA>

<PARA>manpower needs</PARA>
<PARA>facilities required</PARA>
<PARA>costs</PARA>
<PARA>expenditure phasing required</PARA>
<PARA> How are project costs to be evaluated?</PARA>
<PARA> Project costs are DESINE hardware and software plus the cost of applications software and integration of the DESINE equipment with other equipment. See supplementary answer to question 101 regarding further factors taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> What factors will be included in evaluating project cost?</PARA>
<PARA> See the above. Project costs will be evaluated by comparison with any non-Desine solution offered. </PARA>
<PARA> Can a full list of factors which will be taken into account be provided?</PARA>
<PARA> These have been outlined above. </PARA>
<PARA> Will existing investments be a factor?</PARA>
<PARA> Existing investments will be a factor in some enhancements, final extensions and component replacements needed for current equipments before they, or the application system running on them, reach their end of economic life. </PARA>
<PARA> If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA> See answer to previous subquestion. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 117, Supplementary 1</PARA>
<PARA> I note that under the terms of the Contract, IBM is not required to implement OSI standards but only to ``maintain the development of OSI''. I also note that a draft GOSIP document has been issued by the Department of Finance. Is the Department saying it has no plans whatsoever to implement OSI but is merely waiting to see developments? If the Department has an implementation schedule, can this be provided?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> See earlier answer to question 112. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 117, Supplementary 2</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Department aware of any other allied Defence agency that has implemented OSI?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> Defence is aware that allied Defence agencies have adopted OSI and are implementing it progressively. At the time of an overseas visit (July 88):</PARA>
<PARA>No official directive had been issued by the UK MOD on OSI, though OSI was supported. </PARA>
<PARA>The US DOD was waiting for the US GOSIP to be issued as a Federal Information Processing Standard and was then to issue a policy directive and implementation strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTION 117, Supplementary 3</PARA>
<PARA> Has the Department undertaken any recent studies to determine whether OSI is being implemented overseas?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA> No. This topic was a specific area of inquiry by a team involved in the DESINE evaluation which visited overseas in July/August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> If so, what were the conclusions from these studies?</PARA>
<PARA>ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA>Those involved in the 1988 overseas visit concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> UK GOSIP. There is undoubtedly major activity associated with UK GOSIP development and application. The UK Government has mandated its use as a procurement guide rather than a product development guide and appears to have the support of, and be providing the leadership in, the European Community in this area. MODUK is strongly supportive of UK GOSIP and appears ready to apply it widely to non-operational systems being developed. </PARA>
<PARA> US GOSIP. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) is actively pursuing the development and application of US GOSIP as a product development standard. It has extremely strong support from Government departments, particularly Defence. In line with the accepted US philosophy on OSI, US GOSIP is only concerned with interoperability between systems and not within systems. NBS attitudes are somewhat more conservative than those held by the UK Central Computing and Communications Agency in relation to the current availability and reliability of OSI standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn now to a question which was asked at the Estimates Committee hearing. It was question No. 117. The question was: When does Defence expect the Australian Government to issue OSI standards which will be mandatory for all agencies? The response was: Approximately the end of 1990, but how mandatory the standards will be is still to be determined. One reason for the current circulation of the draft GOSIP is to solicit reaction from the Australian information technology industry regarding its preparation to support such standards. I take particular objection to the Department choosing SAA as its computing environment. This is contrary to the requirements of the requests for tender which stated, and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>DESINE is to be implemented through a range of compatible and proven hardware and software products which in total comprise a network architecture. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department's answer stated that it chose a contractor `with a complete proven network architecture'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Defence is committed to OSI. A commitment of all short-listed full tenderers to OSI was subject to detailed investigations during tender evaluation. IBM has already implemented a number of international standards not restricted to OSI and is continuing to do so. Defence will implement proven products that support OSI standards as they become available and meet the Defence requirement. This will include the use of OSI standards in place of IBM proprietary standards where feasible. As the OSI standards are still being formulated and ratified by various subcommittees under the auspices of the International Standards Organisation, none of the tenderers for DESINE was able to offer the complete OSI architecture. It will be some years before this architecture is available. The DESINE evaluation selected a contractor who offered the most cost effective solution, which included a complete proven network architecture, who demonstrated that it was implementing OSI protocols and who agreed to maintain the development of OSI products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The initial environment is based on IBM's systems application architecture, SAA, which supports networking based on IBM's systems network architecture, SNA, and includes OSI standards and other relevant standards endorsed by international bodies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow Senator Newman's line of questioning and pursue the question I asked of the Minister earlier concerning the supply system redevelopment project, the trials which are to take place beginning next Monday, the fact that the three firms competing may yet be subject to an effective veto by IBM at the end of the day because IBM can claim that the successful person chosen by the trial would not be under the architecture of the IBM system. With respect, the answer the Minister gave was pure gobbledegook. I can sympathise with him in that it is not within his sphere of understanding and knowledge and that he is being advised by puppet masters over there who should perhaps come clean to a greater extent than they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry is alive with the speculation that IBM is dictating the requirements and solutions above and beyond the contractual obligations; that IBM is deliberately delaying the process of finalising the suppliers' subcontractors to ensure as little involvement from other vendors as possible. The industry is saying, `Is the Government really imbibing upon an IBM exclusive policy whereby-and the list is as follows-the Department of Finance, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the National Library, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Department of Community Services and Health, the Australian Federal Police, the Health Insurance Commission and some others are now all on IBM compatible systems?'. </PARA>

I did not take them all down and I am sure that she will pick me up on the ones that I miss answering. Towards the end of her speech Senator Bishop referred to $1 billion and 107 departments all using IBM compatible equipment. I am afraid that the honourable senator will have to ask all of those departments at other Estimates committees what the situation is. Tonight we should restrict ourselves to Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator has reverted to the question of the three companies, the trial and the veto. I say again that IBM does not have a veto. That is not merely a question of language construction. IBM does not have a veto, period. Provided that the companies can deliver on whatever they are trialling for, one of them will be the winner. </PARA>

The example I gave was that they did not fit under its architecture. What I am suggesting-and we established it earlier when Senator Watson asked a question and Senator Richardson went on to read the list of exemptions-is that it would seem that the reality as distinct from the rhetoric is that, if IBM is in a position to supply the software, the likelihood of anybody else getting the job is close to zero.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is purely fortuitous that we have had so much about the decision-making process in relation to one program occupying the time of this Committee. I would like to make a few general observations about the decision-making process and then ask a question. I was probably the chief mover for the management report that the Joint Committee prepared a while ago and, in the course of preparing that report, we went through the decision-making process-I might say in passing that it is a great loss to the country that the Government has chosen to suppress that report-and started to address some of the great inefficiencies in the administration of the Department of Defence. Hopefully, the way the climate is going politically, as soon as the Government gets the courage to go to the polls, we will be able to address that, re-form that huge conurbation of human beings and paper over the creek here, clean up the Russell Hill complex, get something efficient and get some more money into the Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very simply, we have a very elaborate decision-making process. The Department of Defence does not buy anything on the spur of the moment. An enormous amount of analysis goes into anything about the need, first of all, which way it can be met, what is the best way of doing it, things are prioritised within the Department and all the facets in the acquisition process are very carefully defined. In the report we pointed out that there were at least four stages: the definition of the requirement; organising the means to achieve the stated requirement; contracting for the purchase of new equipment, and weapons systems; and post-contract administration. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a heap of committees as well. It is known as analysis by paralysis and it really is. Something like 17 committees have to be gone through before anything of any size is bought. The chief one is the Defence Operational Concepts and Capabilities Committee, then the Force Structure Committee, Defence Source Definition Committee and finally the Defence Force Definition Committee before it finally goes to the Minister in Cabinet for purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite having this huge, cumbersome and enormously analytical system the decisions that are coming out are not good in a number of cases. It is a fact that decisions have been overturned. When probably millions of dollars have been invested in decisions and a huge investment has been made in the bureaucracy in churning these things around, decisions come out immaculately researched and justified in every sense, and they are turned around at the whim of the Cabinet or a Minister. One very good example of that was the PC7 aircraft decision. Recommendations for the new trainer were that we buy the PC7. Somehow or other, along the line, when it came to signing the contract or when it came out of Cabinet, it was the PC9 aircraft, which was vastly more expensive, vastly more sophisticated and not the aircraft that the Air Force wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from decisions being overturned, we have also had wrong decisions being made. I accept that while my first assertion is fact, the second is a matter of opinion and I will not take the time of the Committee in debating my opinions on where the wrong decisions have been made. I do, however, want to relate the decision-making process to the announcement made earlier this year to buy five Falcon 900 series jet aircraft for 34 Squadron to provide the VIP Fleet. Again the recommendation from the Department of Defence was to buy the Canadair Challenger aircraft. The decision was overturned in Cabinet by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The whim of the Prime Minister was quite simple. Because it had three engines it had to be safer than something with two engines. I imagine that if a person is Prime Minister or, as Patrick Cook calls him, Little Caesar, he has to make the odd decision on his own from time to time. Maybe the Prime Minister is entitled to turn over the advice of the Department. The other example is when Senator Newman and I had to move the censure motion against Senator Richardson over the appointment of a lieutenant-general for Namibia--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sinai, was it-despite the fact that we have 44 two-stars and above in this huge, over-ranked Defence Force, which is far more than we ever had at the peak of the Second World War. Be that as it may, let me return to the VIP Fleet in 34 Squadron. It may well be argued that the chosen aircraft, the Falcon 900s, are better than the upgraded Challengers that the Air Force wanted. It is also true that the Challengers would do some things better than the Falcons. The difference in cost simply is not worth it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have an Air Force that is strapped for funds, the way both the Navy and the Army are. The provision of VIP aircraft is very much at the bottom of the priorities of the Air Force. What went on? Why was the Prime Minister allowed to get away with this personal whim? I suspect that one of the reasons he was able to get away with it was the fact that the Department had not done any accurate costing on the whole program. Despite its numerous protestations that it has costed out 34 Squadron over the years-and I have taken an interest in the matter-it simply does not have a database to work upon. If it does not have a database with the old aircraft in the squadron, it simply cannot make comparisons with new purchases and new systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years I have repeatedly asked what it cost to keep 34 Squadron going. I have owned aircraft for over 20 years, so I have more than a little insight into what the overheads may be. This year I again asked the question. The reply which was posted to me was to the effect that it cost $2.6m for fuel, $3m for spares, $1.3m for contractor servicing, and $1.2m for incidentals such as handling charges, crew travel and catering, giving an aggregate cost of $8.1m per annum to run the present 34 Squadron. That is as comprehensive a figure as we have ever received from the Department and it is also utterly meaningless because it does nothing to give the true cost of operating those aircraft per hour, per year or by whatever standards one wants to apply. If one does not have that figure, one cannot come up with any other system and claim that it is more efficient, which is what the Government is doing with its leasing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure we have received from the Department does not include the cost of personnel, buildings and aircraft. They happen to be the big expenses, not fuel. Unless the Air Force knows, and unless the Department of Defence knows, how many man-hours and how many personnel it takes to support the aircraft in the present squadron, a very large fraction of their overheads is not determined. Unless they know the capital cost of the aircraft, which is the largest fraction, and amortise those over the life of type, again they cannot come up with any costing. In the face of this total absence of hard data-which should be available, given the resources of the Department to work it out-the Department proceeds with the lease of five new aircraft and tells us that this is cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an allegation earlier that some of the Minister's comments on computer technology and procedures were gobbledegook. The answer the Department gave, in response to a question of mine as to how it arrived at the justification for spending $203m for the lease of those five aircraft for 10 years, that that was the cost effective way to go is a meaningless reply. I do not know the cost of a Falcon 900 aircraft but I imagine that if a government went to the manufacturer and said it wanted to buy five of them, it would buy the five of them for a figure very close to the figure of $203m that we are paying for the lease of these aircraft over 10 years. I doubt very much that those aircraft, on a government purchase basis and a block basis of five which, after all, is a big buy, would not be available for somewhere around the $40m mark each. Nevertheless, we have gone ahead with a leasing agreement and that leasing agreement does not cover maintenance. It has gone out on a three-year tender to the supplier of the aircraft, Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd, at a cost of $3m, $7m or $8m-I forget what the figure was. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, at the end of the day we have a cost of something like $25m a year to the taxpayer for five aircraft which are used only to fly the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and senior Ministers around Australia. There is no defence element at all. It has nothing to do with the Air Force. Whether the Government recovers the money from the user departments, whether the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet pays for the cost of those aircraft against a notional charge value, is absolutely irrelevant. The taxpayer is paying for them. In the face of those bungled accounting measures, I would like to know how the Minister can claim that this is the most cost effective way of running what is essentially just an air charter operation for a very small clientele. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator MacGibbon's questions, fairly obviously it is difficult to provide the total costings on 34 Squadron, given that it shares facilities with a range of other personnel. What is more, the aircraft which are in its care are not used only to transport that small clientele but can be used and, I am advised, are used for other purposes when those aircraft are not required by that small clientele. These include personnel transport and freight operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the need to replace the aircraft is not being debated. There are seven very old aircraft and obviously their down time is becoming greater. I am advised that Defence gave its Minister some options on replacing those very old aircraft rather than advising him to take one particular option. The Minister went ahead with that recommendation. In general, no Minister in any event is bound to accept departmental advice. In fact, Ministers who only ever accept departmental advice and do nothing else are almost bound to get into trouble. The Westminster system of democracy provides that Ministers will at least examine what is put before them and, if they do not accept advice, so be it. I do not think any of us accept every piece of advice put before us. To do so would make our position redundant. It might be possible to be redundant on the Opposition front bench but it is not possible for a Minister in the Australian Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston will not get his chance; that is the real problem. The situation is that the Minister opted to lease five new aircraft. As Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, it is true that Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd is supplying the aircraft as well as providing the maintenance and spares, et cetera. I think the Air Force will be conducting some maintenance that is not contracted out to Hawker Pacific; nonetheless, by using this method the Government has obviously saved a considerable initial outlay, and that was the purpose of the exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon asked for detailed costings. I have spoken to departmental representatives. They will do their best to compile a total costing for 34 Squadron, but it must be understood that, no matter what information they finally provide to Senator MacGibbon, they will have to make some basic assumptions which can be open to challenge, given that it is very difficult to work out exactly the costs of a squadron which, by its nature, must share facilities with other squadrons of the Air Force. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.10)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last thing I want to see is the resources of the Department expended in working out accurate costings on the history of 34 Squadron. Quite clearly that should have been done in the past. It is quite pointless to do it now. Senator Richardson's argument about shared facilities is, with respect, quite irrelevant. All that is being shared is a few buildings; the maintenance and support of the aircraft are not being shared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department should have adopted the cost accounting techniques that have been common practice in the airline industry for 30 or 40 years. The airline industry knows precisely what it costs per hour to fly. It knows what it costs in fuel, spares, crew training, crew support-the whole lot. The Air Force has never done this and it can argue that it really does not matter, but it does matter. One of the reasons why the F18s were purchased was the reduced maintenance man-hours and the quantum jump in mean time between failures on all the major components-not only engines but the radar and other equipment. It is important for the Air Force, the Army and the Navy to know what highly expensive equipment is going to cost so that they may stay on line through the decade or two decades during which the equipment will be used. I will not take the matter any further. The point is that the Government does not have the database on which to make the confident predictions that Senator Richardson and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) have made-that what we have is the cheapest way to go. It may or may not be. The point is that the Minister cannot prove it. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of this decision-making process, I want to talk a little about the Cockatoo Island mess-up. Cockatoo Island is one of Australia's old dockyards. It has two graving docks, and it has been repairing ships for probably 100 years. It has had varied ownership and a varied commercial history, but since we bought the Oberon class submarines it has provided all the support for them. It also did the submarine weapons update-a brilliant Australian program-and completed it very successfully, on contract and on time. All the intermediate level maintenance and major refits that it has carried out since the Oberons came into service have been faultless. The Oberons will go out of service in the immediate future-though I think that it will be a little longer than the Government, having bought this lemon of a submarine from the Swedes, thinks. The Government had a hang-up about the Swedish socialist governments, and no-one else could get a look-in. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the detailed drawings have not yet been delivered to the manufacturer in South Australia, despite the fact that, initially, the whole submarine was going to be built in Australia. The proposition that the bow section and the hull section under the sail or conning tower was to be built in Sweden seemed to create some big problems. I am advised that the Swedes themselves do not know how to design those sections. They went to the Germans for some advice, but the Germans would not help them. It is not surprising that the Swedes do not know how to design those sections, because they have never built anything even half as large as the boat we wanted. However, that is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Here, we had Cockatoo Island supporting the Oberons, which are going out of service. If the Government is correct, the first of the new Swedish 471 submarines will be launched in 1993, and the Oberons will progressively come out of service from then. The point is that there is a short and finite period during which the Oberons have to be maintained, and we have a proved support facility. What does the Government do? It turns round and says that it will sell Cockatoo Island, despite the fact that the lease agreement with ANI runs until 1992 or 1993. The Government got an agreement with ANI that if it crossed its palms with silver it would relinquish the lease contract, and it is going for sale at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no reason for selling Cockatoo Island. The Government, being strapped for money, is out to sell every possible bit of real estate that the Services own. Of course, some of the real estate in Sydney is highly desirable. It is a very wrong decision, and an extremely short-sighted one. The Australian Defence Services are in the business of looking after the defence of this country for hundreds of years ahead, and the short-term pressures of the economic mismanagement and incompetence of this Government do not justify stripping them of sites that they will clearly need for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is this pressure to liquidise assets. No doubt the Government has been approached by some of its real estate mates: `This is a good site for a block of flats'. No doubt that is what gave rise to the decision to sell Cockatoo Island. Of course, that has been compounded by Mr Beazley's pork-barrelling of Western Australia and Fremantle, behind the pretence of a two-ocean Navy. We have no quarrel with the concept of a two-ocean Navy, and least of all do we have any quarrel with the support facilities in the west to operate the Navy-indeed, all three Services. That is just common sense. But, in relation to something like the maintenance of the submarines, to draw up a tender as this one was drawn up, and to design the document so that only Western Australians-in fact, only one company in Western Australia-could tender, when there is only this very short-term need, is very wrong. This takes me back to the difficulties that the Minister was in when he tried to explain why IBM had such a stranglehold on the DESINE contract. It seems to be part of the distressing tendency of the Government to do things for its friends-things which I am quite sure the corporate body of the Department of Defence would not have a bar of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, somewhere in Western Australia. It is all over there in the saltpan country. There were a number of problems. It is interesting to note the Navy's written response to my question. It was a rather bland response-a reference to a leaking seal on one of the propeller shafts, and a bit of anti-fouling paint coming off. I repeated the question in the chamber, and Senator Richardson was good enough to give me Mr Beazley's response. Responding in the House of Representatives to a dorothy dixer, Mr Beazley went into the matter in a great more detail. The claims that I had made about the hull being damaged, and so on, were all supported. What I am concerned about is the secrecy. Senator Newman asked what was the pilot strength of squadrons 3, 75 and 77 of the RAAF. The written reply was that, in the interests of national security, the information could not be revealed. That is absolute nonsense, but it is typical of the Government's responses to so many questions about defence. Its initial response to questions on the submarine program, made on the basis of secrecy, is meaningless. It is not concerned about national secrecy; but, in what it says, there is evidence of its own incompetence in these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned also about the degree of the Government's influence over the press. Quite clearly, there is a degree of censorship on press reporting of defence matters. When I asked Senator Richardson in the chamber about the consequences of the docking operation in Western Australia, a large number of press people phoned me or came to my office. Every one of those journalists, when I had explained the situation, said `I must contact Mr Beazley's office'. That matter was not reported, except in Western Australia. All of the east coast press were suppressed. This links up with the dishonesty that is evident in the Department. So many ministerial statements in the defence field now indicate that decisions are taken on the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) and the Secretary, when, patently, that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite the Joint Committee's report on wastage. We made the point that too high a proportion of the defence vote now goes into capital equipment and that not enough is left for human resources, and the answer is to increase the vote. But the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), in his formal reply, many months later-it was tabled a couple of weeks ago-was to the effect that that decision was based on the advice the CDF and the Secretary had tendered to the Minister. That is not true. The Minister is saying to the Department, `You have $X billion. We are going to buy that equipment because we have contractual obligations. You can fit in the other things you have to do out of what is left over'. It is quite dishonest for the Minister to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent example of the Chinooks was again prefaced by a statement that the advice that the Minister had received from the CDF and the Secretary was that the Chinooks were no longer required. In reality the CDF and the Secretary were again told, `This is your budget. You have got to cut so much out to stay alive'. That is how we got to the absurd situation, very much against the national interest, in which the Chinooks were sacrificed. This has come up since the Senate Estimates hearings. I raised some questions there. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to put a few points on the record. The position with the Chinooks is that there are 11 47Cs. The C model is no longer supported with spares. Within a year or two, we will not be able to fly those aircraft because no more spare parts are being made for them. The Americans had a look at it and decided that it had a good air- frame. They have gone to a D model. They have completely gutted the Chinooks and put in new rotors, new engines, new transmissions and new instrumentation. That has been done for about $US8m to $US9m each. The Minister claims that for us to do it in Australia it would cost $200m. That may be true. I think it is a high figure but for that we get something that is quite essential for the Australian operational doctrine. We get a helicopter which has about half the maintenance man hours per flying hour of the C model and twice the range and twice the payload. That would cost $200m. That capability would cost at least four or five times as much if we had to go on the market in a year or two and replace them-as we surely will have to. </PARA>
<PARA> That aircraft is very important in Army operations. It is the only rotary wing aircraft we have that will lift the 155 millimetre medium artillery gun. It has an essential role in ammunition supply, in fuel tanks, bladder cell supplies, supplies in general and in troop transport. Given that there is very little self-propelled armour and artillery and a general shortage of mobility in this country for the operational deployment force, it is an essential national asset. Let us forget all the business about flood rescue, sea rescue and the rest of it; that is a secondary role, important though it might be. We are in this mess because the Government bungled the helicopter decision years ago when it gave the Black Hawks to the Army. I have a very high regard for the Army Aviation Regiment. I spent a couple of days flying with it at the end of last year. It is a superb unit. But the decision to give it the helicopters led to an enormous degree of irritation, to put it euphemistically, in the Royal Australian Air Force and a great fall in morale. The Army will be the sufferers this time with the loss of the Chinook capability. The question I ask is: What sort of a detailed submission was prepared by the Department which justified the Minister saying that he had the support of the Department to get rid of those aircraft?</PARA>

In six years in this place I have not heard a more extraordinary allegation than the one made tonight to the effect that, having spoken to Senator MacGibbon, journalists had the hide to want to check their story with the Minister and then would not run Senator MacGibbon's allegations. Anyone who has a dud story that does not stack up does not get a credit. Every journalist in the gallery has a duty to at least check the other side of the argument. Senator MacGibbon's arrogance is such that he cannot stand being disputed. But he was disputed on that occasion, and he was found wanting. The journalists in the gallery agree with what I am saying, and they would not run a dud story. That is fine; that is the game we all play. If I put out a statement which attacked the Opposition, I would never expect someone in the gallery not to go to the Opposition and ask for a comment.

I do not hate Western Australia or Western Australians and cannot see any reason for his attack on that fine State. Senator MacGibbon is wrong when he suggests that the Minister or the Department, or both, are involved in an exercise of coming up with a request for tender (RFT) which can only be met by one company. The Defence Source Definition Committee has considered a report produced for departmental consideration on this question. It has met a couple of times over the past few weeks to complete its deliberations. It has recommended that three companies be short-listed and invited to tender for the work. The RFT will be issued by 1 July this year. It is hoped that responses will close three months later. There is no great magic about that. Once again, the Government is acting properly in making sure that as many companies as possible are given the opportunity to tender. It is interesting to note-again, it is something that Government spokesmen have been saying for some time now-that whenever any attempt is made by the Government to sell off any government enterprise it is immediately criticised by the Opposition, which runs counter, of course, to its professed philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have moved from aeroplanes through to submarines, then to helicopters and back to the decision on the Chinooks. It is true that that decision was taken on the recommendation of the Department of Defence. The Department had to consider all the options available. I would not have thought that the answers which have so far been given have precluded costs being a factor in the decision; they obviously were. The upgrade which Senator MacGibbon has mentioned from a C model to a D model was estimated to cost in the region of $200m. That was the Defence Department's estimate. I suppose Senator MacGibbon could try to vary that, but it was a very, very substantial amount of money. The Defence Department then had to look at whether there was justification for that sort of upgrade, particularly when the Black Hawk could cover practically every operation that the Chinook would be involved in. The great majority of the tasks of the Chinook can be performed by the Black Hawk. In the light of the costs of the upgrade and the fact that the Black Hawk can pretty well do what the Chinook can do, then the Department, regretfully-I do not think there was joy in the decision-recommended to the Minister that the Chinooks should go. I think that is responsible management rather than any problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In finishing my response, I want to turn to the question of the submarines and the Swedes. The fact is that the Department recommended the Swedes. When I look to my left at this collection of advisers here, I do not think I am looking at a bunch of rabid socialists besotted by the Swedes; I doubt that very much. There was a very lengthy technical assessment. I do not remember how long it took, but it went on for a very long time and it was no easy decision. Of course there were tremendous lobbying efforts from all concerned. But as I recall it the lobbying was not coming from the Swedes or the Germans but rather from the States. </PARA>
<PARA> State governments, all over Australia, were filling aircraft to Canberra with Ministers and advisers who were running around the corridors of this place pleading with governments about where to put the main part of these contracts, where the main benefits would go, rather than putting forward arguments about whether the right technology was being chosen. The Defence Department had the opportunity, in the absence of all those sorts of representations, to look solely at the issue of technical capabilities, and came down with the recommendation for the Swedes. I am not aware of any problems of great magnitude with that project. Obviously with massive projects there are always going to be some hiccups. Not everything goes smoothly when we are spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. None the less, the project is proceeding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the Minister brought up the business about the States lobbying for the submarine program, because this was the Government's intention, to take the argument away from the technical suitability or the capabilities of the design and turn it into an auction, playing on the cupidity of the various State Premiers. We had this most unseemly public competition before the submarine decision as to whether it would be South Australia, Victoria or New South Wales. The technical elements of the decision were totally suppressed, and I believe they were suppressed intentionally by the Government because it did not want them exposed for examination. Of course it just happened that poor old Mr Bannon was coming up for an election. He was a bit shaky, so a bit more Beazley pork-barrelling, and surprise, surprise, the State with no heavy engineering capability, the State with no ship building capability, gets the bonus and Mr Bannon wins the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have the same thing happening with New South Wales and Victoria at the present time with the Anzac ship program. We should not be in that position. These are national matters, they are not matters to be debated between Premiers as to whether they can do something better than someone else. Let us work out what is best for the country, first of all from the design point of view, and let us see who can build them most efficiently. Again on the management situation, the Government made a very bad mistake when it looked at, and selected, only two yards in Australia, a consortium at Newcastle and a consortium at Williamstown in Victoria. It said, `Those are the two which are going to build this new Anzac frigate. You get yourself designers and then we will look at the package when you have worked it up'. The decision making is on at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a yard in Victoria, which some people would probably argue is the better of the two yards, but with a Third World designed ship to sell. We have a yard in New South Wales that has yet to prove itself in some ways, with a very well designed ship. It is quite wrong to do that. They are locked in and there is no flexibility at all. We should have decided what sort of ship we wanted, worked out the design, and then put it out to tender. But I divert on that. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that the Minister is making about the Chinooks is technically quite wrong. It is not true to say that anything the Chinooks can do, the Black Hawks can do. They simply cannot. They cannot lift even half the load, and the Army does have a requirement for those heavy loads. It is not for only weapons; it is for stores, vehicles and all sorts of things. To say that the Black Hawk will do nearly all of the things that the Chinook will do is meaningless unless one thinks that if it flies it is doing the same task, so let us leave it at that. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the request for tender document. I happen to have in my possession the official publication of the request for tender that was issued by the Government in relation to the intermediate level docking of the Oberon boats. The only organisations which are permitted to tender are the Garden Island dockyard on the east coast and the shipyards in the Fremantle-Perth region. They may put up three, but in essence there is only one in the west that will be appointed as a tenderer. The nomination of the Garden Island dockyard is just a fiction because Garden Island does not do submarine overhauls. It is in the process of being privatised at the moment. It cannot even maintain the surface ships that it is responsible for for the Royal Australian Navy. It has farmed some of those out to Cockatoo Island. There is no way it can undertake to overhaul the intermediate level docking of the Oberon boats. It is just a straw man put up to enable the Minister to claim that he is being fair in his usual way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to debate the Minister's allegations and assertions about the press releases in the gallery here, but those of us who are interested in defence are concerned at the way the Minister leans on the gallery. The point that he ought to recognise is that the most informed, most authoritative journalist in the country in defence matters, Peter Young, was driven out of employment covertly by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an outrageous assertion by Senator MacGibbon. His belief in who might be the most informed, best journalist on anything usually depends upon anyone who might agree with him from time to time, rather than on any objective assessment of merit. The facts are that there are a number of journalists in this country who have a great knowledge of defence matters. The difficulty the honourable senator has had is that generally speaking he has not been able to produce the goods in his criticisms of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). The Minister is regarded by the gallery quite rightly as being competent. The honourable senator is not held in that same regard and so he is not treated in the same way. Tough, that is the business, he should lift his game and he might get the right treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coming back to the question of Western Australia, as I said there is a request for tender and three companies are being invited. I do not believe the Government can do anything more than that. Certainly there is no decision in the Government's mind as to one of those three inevitably being chosen. There is a correct procedure. I do not have a response to what the honourable senator has said about Garden Island. I will get one for him but I will have to take that on notice, as I am not certain of it at the moment. Of course the States are going to lobby when big defence contracts are up. Naturally enough people from the States will be wandering around the corridors. I had an experience of it with the Antarctic ship project. They were worrying about it. Unfortunately for some of the honourable senator's colleagues, who cannot follow answers at Estimates committees, they simply did not realise that it was not a decision for the Government, it was a decision for P and O Polar, which had won the contract. It was not for me. So they could lobby me all they liked, but it did not matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the submarines, obviously State governments were involved, as they will be with the frigates. That will not be the determining factor for the Government in any of those contracts. It will always come back to the Department of Defence advising us on what is the best technical solution to the problem. In the case of the submarines, the Department decided on the Swedes. The Government accepted the recommendation. We will see what happens with the frigates. </PARA>

Where there is a payment from the non-custodial parent, after a free area of $6 or $12 a week the supporting parent's benefit payment is withdrawn at a rate of 50c for each dollar of payment by the non-custodial parent above the free area. I am sure that information would have been part of a press statement or a statement to the House by the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, at the time that that was the arrangement which would apply. There is a free area. I cannot remember off the top of my head whether it is $6 or $12 per child. Beyond that, any payment from the non-custodial parent induces a reduction in the supporting parent's benefit payment of 50c for every dollar of payment received from the non-custodial parent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that the question is not very clear. I am relying on my own recollection of the Cabinet discussions of these matters, which goes back six to 12 months. Prior to the introduction of the present policy there were a number of Family Court orders on maintenance. Those maintenance payments affected the supporting parent's benefit entitlement that the custodial parent may have been entitled to receive. Since the Child Support Agency was established and the present policy was introduced, on a prospective basis-that is, for new applicants-there is a requirement that prior to receiving the supporting parent's benefit a custodial parent must make an application to receive maintenance through the CSA. That condition may be waived under certain circumstances, for example, where it is accepted that an attempt to recover a contribution from the non-custodial parent could endanger, in a physical sense, the custodial parent. I do not have the precise details. It is a social security matter rather than a Treasury and Taxation Office matter. There is a requirement under normal circumstances, but that requirement may under abnormal circumstances be waived, for a custodial parent to make an application to receive maintenance from the non-custodial parent as a prerequisite to receiving supporting parents benefit. Obviously there will be some people-I do not know the numbers-who are in receipt of a payment from a non-custodial parent, but if the payment is not sufficiently large to disqualify the custodial parent from the supporting parent's benefit, in those circumstances those custodial parents would receive a part supporting parent's benefit payment.</PARA></TALK.START>

My question related to the fact that a nine-week delay was incurred by the custodial parent joining the scheme from the time of registration with the Agency to the time of the receipt of first payment. I was told that this delay was caused by the problem of actually getting the money from the non-custodial parent-the gap between the time of the employer putting in the non-custodial parent payment and the time that it was passed through Social Security. That gave me the impression that the money was not paid to the custodial parent until it had actually been received by the Agency. Is that not correct?</PARA></TALK.START>

The second case involved a custodial parent where both had once again registered, but on this occasion it was the custodial parent who was notified that she was owed over $3,000, when that was not the case. It would have caused embarrassment to a degree because an amicable arrangement had been struck with the lady's husband. In fact, most payments had been received before they were due.

It can then pass to a retailer-wholesaler and the profit margin of 10 per cent on the tax paid cost can be added and another sales tax on the margin of 20 per cent adds an additional $2.40.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The resumption of debate on this important Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is welcome. Certainly, the period that has elapsed since the matter first came before the Senate has been properly utilised. Nonetheless, it has to be said that this Bill, and the amendments to which the Government has finally agreed after extensive negotiations with the Opposition and ethnic community groups, are a flawed response to the FitzGerald Commission to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which conducted the most comprehensive review of immigration in 10 years. It took nine months to examine the issues, consulted with 587 individuals and organisations, received 970 written submissions and held four workshops and commissioned 11 consultancies to advise it. It came up with a series of very specific and carefully thought out recommendations. I think it can be fairly said that in significant respects the Government has rejected those recommendations for what could be described as cheap electoral purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission quite rightly identified citizenship as the ultimate expression of a commitment to Australia. We in the Opposition wholeheartedly share that recognition. It is of crucial importance that all of those who reside within our borders have that fundamental commitment. They should recognise what is entailed in being an Australian citizen and should aspire to become one as soon as possible. The Government has accepted the core recommendation that immigration policies should be developed in the national interest for all Australians and that in the philosophy of immigration emphasis should be given to Australia, the Australian identity and a commitment to Australia. That is a very worthwhile and highly desirable commitment. The Government has also accepted a recommendation to develop and explain to the public a rationale for immigration, especially having regard to the international context in which immigration takes place. There is no doubt that there is a great deal of misunderstanding and confusion in the community as to some of the crucial ingredients in immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, however, has not accepted a recommendation to examine ways of restricting public benefits to non-citizens as a means of enhancing the value of citizenship. That recommendation was not made lightly by FitzGerald. That reflects an overwhelming view in the community that there should be a quid quo pro. If one is a resident of Australia one should actively seek to become a citizen and, to the extent that one chooses not to do so, then certain consequences should flow. To the extent that one will not otherwise be out on the streets, it seems reasonable to us that one should pay a pecuniary penalty for choosing not to accept Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most crucial recommendation of all which the Government has studiously ignored is the recommendation to increase the total quota intake to 150,000. I believe it has done that because it has really been pandering to a constituency in this country that still shares the old shibboleths about--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may be but that does not affect the principle of the issue. For my money, there are very significant economic benefits that flow from an increased immigration intake. I do not regard going from 140,000 to 150,000 as a huge leap. But I do believe it would be a very useful way of signalling to the rest of the world that Australia is prepared to increase its intake even though we have significant levels of unemployment, that we do recognise the very great contribution that has been made to social cohesion and the welfare of the nation by an immigration policy that has seen about 4.7 million people come to this country since 1949.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would have been a very symbolic gesture to have made that increase-one that would not have threatened the infrastructure of the nation, which is one of the explanations given for not taking that leap. Also, in many ways it would have enabled the Government to adopt another very significant recommendation of FitzGerald-that is, to place emphasis on skills and entrepreneurial factors. To the extent that FitzGerald recommended that the highest weightings go to those factors, the Government has again chosen to disregard that recommendation. An increase to 150,000 would have allowed the Government to increase the economic component of the intake, maintain the family relationship and refugee components, although as a reduced proportion of the total. That would have suited everyone in the community. Again it is a sign of timidity on the part of the Government that it has not been prepared to bite the bullet in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The further recommendation that entitlement to sponsor immigrants including kinship should be limited to Australian citizens was once again disregarded by the Government. All in all, one can say that the Government has shown an abundance of caution. Indeed, Dr FitzGerald, in the Sunday Telegraph, was very concerned about the highly political approach that the Government had taken. He even said that there had been a deliberate campaign aimed at discrediting the report. He attributed that to persons, one of whom was on the Prime Minister's personal staff and another of whom was a senior officer in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Dr FitzGerald made no bones about saying that they prepared a document which was simply for the purpose of scaring the pants off most of the ethnic community. He described it as one of the most mendacious documents he had ever seen in government and that is pretty strong language from one who was formerly an ambassador and is universally well regarded in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> He certainly gives the Government high praise for adopting the floating pass mark to replace the old fixed points system. I think we all share the view that that is a change that is welcome and will allow for more flexibility but ultimately keep a cap on the intake so that governments remain in control of the numbers and that is very important change for the better. Dr FitzGerald was critical of the Government's decision to reject the recommendation that it is necessary to speak English. He did say:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is unfortunate. I think it's wrong. People talk about all these people who came out from Greece or wherever in 1950 and became a great entrepreneur and all that, but times change. </PARA>
<PARA>It is yet another indication that the Government has not been prepared to act on what I think are very sensible recommendations. We take the view that the Government has walked away from the major recommendations of the FitzGerald report and not placed sufficient emphasis on skills and investment criteria and, indeed, by not increasing the intake in the way that I have indicated, it has shown that it is not really prepared to expand and regard immigration policy as an opportunity to increase economic growth; it is essentially a holding operation aimed at pandering to various sectional interests in the community. To that extent it is lacking in foresight. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate response as reflected in the Bills does contain a number of positive aspects and I would like to deal with several of them. We welcome the Government's ultimate decision to retain in the Minister the discretion to make the ultimate decision on who should enter this country and who should remain here. As the Minister said previously, it is necessary to detach final decisions from political influence but, at the end of the day, there are some decisions the Government simply cannot shirk. It is a responsibility of the Government, not the bureaucracy, and there are and always will be hard cases. I recall its being said by a renowned Englishman, whose name escapes me for the moment, that a tax system breathes through its loopholes. One could say the same about immigration policy. It is necessary to have those areas of discretion to accommodate the hard cases that simply do not show up in the official rule book. Unless we are prepared to accept the ultimate political responsibility, we are in the wrong kitchen. It has been a change for the better that the Minister, to his credit, has been prepared to rethink the matter and to have the discretion vest where it ought to vest and not be devolved to bureaucrats, who should not be put in the invidious position of having to make hard decisions. Ultimately, the outcome in that area is welcome and will be a significant change for the better. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that there is a radically revised approach to immigration decision-making. It is one that we welcome. The proposed codification of the decision-making process to determine the composition of the intake is desirable. It is important that policies be laid down to govern the rules for entry and stay in Australia. As long as the Minister is the one who shares ultimate responsibility for those decisions, we support that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The new two-tier system of review similarly is one we welcome. The concept of having a first stage review by specialist officers of the Department is desirable and worth supporting. The second tier-the review by the Immigration Review Tribunal-is more controversial, to the extent that although persons will not be legally represented before the Tribunal, there will not be the traditional adversarial approach. That is something that, at this stage, we are prepared to take on trial. We take the view, I think, that a great deal of time, resources and money can be spent in an area where, if decision-making is seen to be too lax or even too complicated, persons can be encouraged to come to Australia and test that very process. It is something that should be of concern to us. To a certain extent there is a demonstration effect that will flow from what is a fairly peremptory approach but nonetheless one that does deserve our support at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the rules regarding the total intake, again we recognise the virtues of having a floating points system. The balance of family test for families wanting to migrate to Australia is a desirable innovation and, as the Minister has pointed out, the costs of the current arrangements are very significant indeed, parents constituting something like 9 per cent of the total migration of families. Sixty per cent of those parents of working age coming here are unemployed. People of age 45 and over are generally very hard to find employment for, and the balance of family test is said to save some $300m. We do regard that as a very significant amount and, hopefully, the change will mean that those who do come here will be much less dependent upon the Australian welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> The entitlement to an interpreter in line with the approach adopted by the Social Security Review Tribunal is similarly welcome. The decision to extend the time limit to ensure that time does not run out when an appeal is part heard before a federal court is, I would have thought, plain common sense. The decision to allow an additional period if the applicant is overseas is again desirable and to be welcomed. The restructuring of the intake to provide for two categories of family-priority family and concessional family-again, whilst it is a departure from the recommendations of FitzGerald, is ultimately something that we would be happy to accommodate, certainly to the extent that caps will be put in place in each of the categories. We see that as desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the Minister's decision to establish a joint select committee which will be charged with considering the regulations which will prescribe decision criteria for the grant of visas and entry permits, and will examine whether those regulations reflect current and announced policies. As a result of a suggestion put by my colleague Mr Ruddock, the Government has also given the committee extensive powers of subpoena and production of documents. Again that is very necessary and we are confident that the committee will ensure that the regulations are not abused. Because of the sunset clauses, it will not be there in perpetuity but will be able to scrutinise closely while still allowing the Government the flexibility that is necessary to remain in control of the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the amended Bill and, indeed, the package. We look forward to the Minister moving the amendments in the form that he has foreshadowed and certainly of which I have a copy. I will leave it to him to spell out the details of those amendments. Essentially they go a long way to meet our concerns in the area. As a result we will have a Migration Act that will provide the necessary flexibility that will improve quite considerably on some of the procedures that were becoming outdated but will nonetheless do substantial justice to those wanting to come to this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak for a few minutes about the formation of a pro-choice group of parliamentarians in the Federal Parliament. It is not a matter that I expected to be speaking about. I feel, like most people in the Parliament with reasonable common sense, that it is an issue I do not want to be actively involved in. However, in view of the fact that it has been announced that the so-called Pro-Life Group is now looking at seeking to move a motion or amend the Medicare legislation to eliminate the right of women, particularly poor women, to have legal abortions conducted and paid for under Medicare, many members of the Parliament have thought it necessary to form what we call a pro-choice group so that the issue does not lapse by default and so that the willingness of many people in the community who strongly oppose the views of the so-called Pro-Life Group can have an actively organised voice in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, our group did not seek to be formed of our own volition. We openly admit that we are a reactive group, that we have formed in reaction to the publicity that has occurred over the last few weeks about the so-called Pro-Life Group. I mention in particular the efforts instigated by my colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, who took the first step in outlining to all Federal Labor members the need to form a pro-choice group. Already there has been an excellent response. Many Labor members from both Houses-within the lexicon of the Labor Party, from all factions-have indicated that they will support this group. </PARA>
<PARA> We held our first meeting last week. We decided to write to all members of parliament and invite them to indicate whether they want to join a pro-choice group in the Federal Parliament. Although the letter was sent only at the end of last week and this is the first sitting day after the weekend, there has already been formal indication that members of other political parties would be willing to join a pro-choice group on this issue. Although we are not in the head counting business-I know some people may suggest that Senator Robert Ray and I have been known to count the occasional head in the past-in this case it is not a matter of counting every head in the Parliament and lining people up as being either pro-choice or so-called pro-life. The issue is far too important to be treated in that way. We want it to be known that we are interested in the issue, in ensuring that ordinary Australian women who make the choice, as is their right in accordance with the laws of the land, to have a termination of pregnancy have the support of Medicare funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to debate the merits of the issue at this time. It has been debated many times before and I am sure it will be debated in the near future if the so-called Pro-Life Group introduces its legislation. The only thing I put to the Senate-this is why I am now acting as a co-convener for the pro-choice group-is that I believe abortion is a matter for the woman to decide. Whatever she chooses-if she chooses to have the baby, if she chooses not to have the baby and to have an abortion in accordance with the laws of the land-she should be given every support. In the past this issue has been dominated by moralising men who choose to ram down the throats of women what they think should happen to their bodies. I believe that in this part of the twentieth century that attitude should not be taken. I believe that our pro-choice group will perform a valuable role in countering some of the, in my view, misleading information, misleading arguments and, above all, some of the more emotional comments made by members of the so-called Pro-Life Group. </PARA>
<PARA> As I discovered last Thursday night in attempting to debate this issue with Senator Harradine on a television program, the debate very quickly degenerates into remarks about murder of the unborn child, babies being cut up, suction pumps and goodness knows what else. In my view, it is all totally unnecessary. The remarks are aimed at putting psychological pressure on women. I refer in particular to the emotional charge that women flippantly decide to have an abortion. I cannot imagine any woman in Australia flippantly deciding that it would be good fun to have an abortion. I must admit that I know a couple of women who have chosen to have an abortion. They did it legally, after consultation with the appropriate medical authorities, and they certainly did not do it, as Senator Harradine suggested on television, so that they could have a trip overseas or because it interfered with their holiday plans. I completely reject the idea that abortion is used by women in a flippant and offhand way. That suggestion denigrates all women in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In that televised debate, in response to Senator Harradine's remarks about murder, I said that if he believes abortion is murder, he and his supporters should be fair dinkum and attempt to introduce legislation to the effect that when a woman has an abortion she is committing the offence of murder under the criminal code. If one extended that one would have to argue that if a woman had a miscarriage she may have to be charged with manslaughter-if one takes the view that she is murdering the unborn child and that that is the same as murdering someone after he or she has been born. I do not accept that. I do not think that is accepted anywhere in the Western world. I certainly hope it is not. I hope our pro-choice group can help to put that argument to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other reasons I wanted to speak about this matter tonight is that while the pro-choice group was having its first meeting last Tuesday, a meeting of the Pro-Life Group took place in Parliament House. The details of that discussion have come to my attention. Sources have given me a very detailed run-down of the discussion that took place in that meeting at about 5 o'clock last Tuesday. People in the so-called Pro-Life Group argue that they are interested in the issue on a very high moral plane. In regard to the details of the discussion that took place, one would not exactly say that it was a grubby political exercise, but it was certainly a very mundane political exercise. The meeting tried to sort out the tactics as to how the group could introduce legislation into the Federal Parliament to stop Medicare funding for legal abortions. First of all, I do not know all of those who attended, but obviously one would expect Senator Harradine to have been there as Chairman of the Pro-Life Group. As I understand it, members of all political parties attended. I do not deny their right to hold what are, in their terms, very strong moral views concerning abortion. My group does not in any way decry the fact that there are strongly held views about abortion. However, our attitude is that those views should be held at a personal level and should not be imposed on others through legislation, at either State or Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> Even allowing for the fact that people in the Pro-Life Group have very strong views, some of their remarks and comments and discussions are rather illuminating, according to my sources. First, a number of people had a very strong desire to ensure that no information about their meeting would leak out. That had happened after the previous meeting and had caused them some embarrassment, and they had to make absolutely sure that there was no leak from this one. Unfortunately for them, they did not do too well in that regard. From my sources, I have some pretty detailed discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> First, they discussed some of the arguments that could be used in favour of their proposition. One of those was that abortion should not be available to women because in Australia there are many people who want to adopt children. The point was made that if women-young girls, in particular-who, unfortunately, became pregnant had to continue with the pregnancy, there would be a much bigger pool of babies available for adoption. One person at the meeting commented that one million people out there wanted to adopt children. They would not care whether a child was Australian, Vietnamese or of any other origin. I must say that that is a very strange attitude from people who are supposed to be adopting a very moral position about abortion. It is not a particularly moral or a very uplifting sort of argument. </PARA>
<PARA> According to my sources, one of the discussions that took place at this meeting concerned tactics: `If we are successful in having legislation passed to remove Medicare payments, there will be a lot more unwanted children'. One member said, `We have to have an absolutely foolproof oversupply of pregnancy support services'. Another member present-it may have been Senator Harradine-said, `I cannot follow the argument. I donate to pregnancy support all the time'. The argument continued. Other members said that they could not go round saying nice things about supporting pregnant girls if there were no pregnancy support facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the attention of the meeting turned to tactics-whether the Bill could be introduced before the Parliament rose for the winter recess. I understand that, according to Senator Harradine, the main tactic was that when Parliament went into recess there could be a massive campaign, with petitions, and so on, and that the group could expect enormous support in the community. This, again, is an example of anticipation that those in the community who support the right to life will be expected to put a lot of pressure on members of parliament about the way they should vote. It was suggested also that the period leading up to an election would be a more advantageous time to put pressure on. Again, that is not a very morally uplifting argument about the issue of abortion. It is a straight political argument about how to apply the greatest pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more interesting side issues that arose in the course of the discussion concerned whether legislation should be introduced in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. One member present commented that if it were to be done in the Senate, they would have to wait until after the next election, when half the Democrats would be got rid of. I think that that member hoped that the Democrats would be decimated, that they would be replaced by people more sympathetic to the so-called Pro-Life view. I do not know what the Democrats' view-individually or collectively-about this legislation is, though I presume that theirs is a conscience vote. It is interesting to note, however, that already the Pro-Life Group is counting all the Democrats in the Senate as being against them on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the discussion got round to the good old question of numbers. In the past I have been accused within the Labor Party of occasionally counting numbers. So has Senator Robert Ray. Indeed, I think that everybody in politics has counted numbers from time to time. It is part and parcel of the whole arrangement. However, the information that I have indicates that this mob is not very good at counting. At the very best, they were able to count only one or two people. They had a circuitous discussion about the numbers in the House of Representatives. At one stage they talked about some of the women there. Kathy Martin was accused of being a bit soft on the proposition. Nobody was sure what Mary Crawford's view was. Generally, however, the women in the House of Representatives were considered not to be reliable from the point of view of supporting the Pro-Life Group. Mr Katter, a long-time member of the House of Representatives, was at the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just been handed a note. I should not be interrupted by a written interjection from the Minister, but I shall keep it in my personal records for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Katter talked about how, way back at the time of the so-called Lamb-McKenzie amendments in 1973, there was an enormous lobby campaign-telegrams to everybody, and so on-and about how successful it had been. Even on the basis of their own head count, these people were extremely unsure about their numbers. After a lengthy meeting, they could not decide whether it would be better to introduce legislation in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion came round to the question of which member should introduce the legislation if it were to be introduced in the House of Representatives. The name of a colleague of mine-David Charles, the member for Isaacs, and a member of the Pro-Life Group, who was not at the meeting-was immediately thrown up. I suspect that that was because he was not at the meeting to reject the advances. The main reason that was put forward was that David had already announced that he would not stand at the next election. In that case he could be the bunny to introduce the legislation or the amendment in the lower House.</PARA>
<PARA> It was then realised that Mr Katter might be thinking of retiring. He was asked whether he would do it, but he equivocated. I think that he is still weighing up whether to run again. It is interesting that even these pro-life advocates are looking for somebody who will not be standing at the next election. They do not want somebody to take the heat of putting up the proposition either in this chamber or in the House of Representatives. Again, the way in which the matter has been handled is not particularly morally uplifting; it is down to simple tactics. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the discussion got round to the role of Senator Michael Tate, who is a member of the Pro-Life Group. I gather that, at the meeting, there was certainly some bad spleen vented about the way Senator Tate had refused to go along with the proposal to introduce amendments to stop Medicare payments. Since then, Senator Tate has published a letter and made statements to the effect that, although he has a pro-life view, he wants women to be able to choose not to have abortions. He has indicated that if any amendment or legislation is introduced into the Parliament by the Pro-Life Group, he will vote against it. There have been several suggestions that a deputation should go to see Senator Tate to try to convince him to return to what I suppose Senator Harradine would call the fold of the true believers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a final interesting comment on the meeting that took place. During one of the intense parts of the discussion Senator Bjelke-Petersen entered the room and asked if anyone had seen her book. The meeting was diverted into trying to find Senator Bjelke-Petersen's book. She said that she had paid $5 for the book and wanted it returned. She then asked what had been decided. At that stage no-one could work out what had been decided. The meeting gradually petered out. From my source it is still not clear whether the group got anyone to move the amendments, either in this place or in the House of Representatives. Even if it got somebody, the nature of those amendments, resolutions or the legislation is still not clear. It is still not clear whether its members agree amongst themselves about the tactics they want to employ. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought I would bring all this information to the attention of the Senate tonight. I look forward to receiving more information about the next meeting of the so-called Pro-Life Group. I assure it that the Pro-Choice Group that has been formed is very open about its views and the way it wants to conduct itself. We are not too worried if there are leaks about our discussions or tactics. We hope that in the future, if the Pro-Life Group wishes to proceed, it should not have an obsession with secrecy or the working out of what, in my view, are pretty ordinary political tactics. It should not put pressure upon people to try to bluff legislation through this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, all I say is that, from all the indications so far, I do not believe that a majority of the Australian Parliament, in either chamber, will vote for this legislation or proposal, whatever it may be. I think there are more than enough people in all parties to make sure that it is rejected. All the evidence from around Australia indicates, in all public opinion polls conducted on these sorts of issues, that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of Australian citizens support the right of women to have abortions under reasonable and certain conditions and support the right of poor women in particular to get Medicare payments. I trust that the so-called Pro-Life Group will realise the error of its ways and will not bring what will be a divisive and unnecessary issue on to the floor of Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would like to thank you for your courtesy in sending me a letter at the end of the week advising me of the resolution passed by the Senate of congratulations relating to the concert of the Canberra City Opera in the Great Hall. I certainly prize that letter and I commend you for your decision to send, I presume, all those involved such a letter. I would also like to mention that there were others involved who did assist considerably towards the success of that concert. May I include your Private Secretary, Mr Robert Walsh, in that list? He listened to my continual pressure and advised me on methods that I should adopt to bring this matter about. On top of that, could I also mention that Senator David Hamer, your Deputy, was the person who made the original suggestion to Mr David Parker that he should promote his excellent young and talented singers from the Canberra School of Music to members of parliament thought this concert by the Canberra City Opera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to thank Marjorie Cleghorn of the Joint House Department, who publicised the concert in Parliament House by notifying every occupant in the House and assisted in setting up the Hall and ushering in special guests. Her efforts certainly went far beyond what was required of her as a member of the Joint House Department, and her enthusiasm was certainly appreciated by everyone. Mr John Christison liaised with David Parker and all the organisers in Parliament House and produced the program for the concert. Mrs Wendy Brazil, of Senator David Hamer's staff, publicised the concert both with the general public and with backup publicity in the House, especially with senators and members, organised the seating and ushered in various VIP guests.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we all have an opportunity in the future of hearing these outstanding young talents once again in the Great Hall of the Parliament. I hope that on any future occasion that did take place, many more members of parliament would get there early enough so that they could actually get into the hall, because the crowd was so immense that some who came a little late were unable to hear this wonderfully talented, outstanding young group of singers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will have no difficulty remembering the recent extraordinary assault by New South Wales police officers on the home of Mr David Gundy and his family, leading to the awakening of Mr Gundy and the discharge of one or more firearm blasts which left the victim mortally wounded and his bed covered with blood. According to news reports, Mr Gundy died within an hour of the shooting incident. It is to be hoped that on 10 July, when Mr Kevin Waller, the State Coroner for New South Wales, commences the inquest into Mr Gundy's death, he will be able to examine all available evidence and testimony in the course of arriving at a finding which does justice to all concerned. The Australian coronial system is very much in the spotlight at the moment, and Justice Muirhead and many others have certainly found it wanting and have criticised it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been reported that only seconds before Mr Gundy was fatally shot, he was asleep in his own bed in his own home. He should have been safe. Because of an imputed connection with a wanted man, 10 policemen smashed down his front door, broke into his home and entered carrying shotguns and other weapons. No-one is at their best at 4.50 in the morning, especially after having been woken in the manner in which David Gundy was. The police said he struggled with them and was accidentally shot. It is less than surprising that almost any family man would struggle with an unidentified person carrying a firearm who had broken down his front door at 4.50 in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The Southern Crime Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Ronald Stephenson, was quoted in the Daily Telegraph of Friday, 28 April, as having said that although Mr Gundy was not a suspect, he was satisfied that the police had acted properly during the raid. This was despite the fact that Mr Gundy was unarmed and no weapons were found in his home. No doubt at the inquest the Southern Crime Squad Commander can explain how the death of an innocent man at the hands of the police can be called `acting properly', when our legislation has not given even the courts the power of life and death. </PARA>
<PARA> From press reports it appears that the police account of the shooting conflicts with that of Mr Gundy's young son Bradley, who was asleep in the house at the time of the raid. He was woken by the noise of loud banging and was escorted from his room to the lounge and then to the kitchen, together with his uncle. Bradley was unaware of the events that took his father's life. He heard no gun shots or struggle. Bradley said he learned of his father's death from a television news broadcast later that day after being escorted by police from his home to stay with relatives. Mr Pickering, the New South Wales Minister for Police, is recorded as saying that he was concerned at the death but that he understood that the police could possibly be feeling uptight after the earlier shooting of two policemen. It makes me wonder how uptight the Aboriginal community was feeling after Mr Gundy's sudden demise. </PARA>
<PARA> It now remains for the State Coroner to inquire into the full facts and circumstances and, I repeat, I sincerely trust that he will be in a position to do so impartially and without the sort of hindrance that was placed on the Western Australian Coroner, Mr David McCann, when 17 police officers declined to provide testimony at the inquest into the death of Stephen Wardle. Stephen's parents, Mr and Mrs Ross Tilbury, have had to ask for a royal commission into their son's death in order for the full facts of the circumstances of his death to be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Government of New South Wales to accept responsibility for the ongoing expenses relating to the education and well-being of Mr Gundy's son Bradley, who has been left without a father. The Apex organisation is to be commended for having instituted a fund for the family. However, the Apex fund should not be used as an excuse for the Government to evade its full duty towards this young boy. The Apex fund must be considered as supplementary to full Government support. </PARA>
<PARA> On Wednesday, 31 May, there will be marches in some Australian cities in support of the Gundy family and I believe that there will be one in Perth. They certainly have my support, and my sympathy goes out to the Gundy family. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2970" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following response:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs (the Foundation) was incorporated in New South Wales in December 1964 and was placed in liquidation in May 1976. During this period it is likely the Foundation would have received public funds from a number of sources. I am not in a position to estimate the total amount.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) has informed me that from its records it cannot verify a total amount provided by DAA and the former Officer of Aboriginal Affairs, although it would appear that it could be somewhat less than $900,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) On 13 October 1975 the Foundation agreed to an inquiry into its management and operation which had been requested by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>The confidential report of the DAA inquiry was provided to the new Government in December 1975. I am informed by DAA that the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Ian Viner, considered and acted upon the Report.</PARA>
<PARA>In the circumstances, I do not intend to table a copy.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) DAA does not have (nor should it) a detailed record of association of Mr Perkins and Mr Hall with the Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of public record, however, that Mr Perkins played a significant role in the incorporation of the Foundation and he was involved in the early management of its affairs. He is listed as a subscriber in the Memorandum of Association of the Company, together with the then Lord Mayor of Sydney, a retired Deputy Commissioner of police, two academics, a nursing sister and an accountant.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980, he was appointed by a judge in the New South Wales Supreme Court to represent members of the Foundation in the distribution of surplus assets and, in this regard, to bring forward a draft scheme applying such assets cy-pres, before the Master of Equity.</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever other association Mr Hall may have had with the Foundation it would appear that he served as President for a short period from December 1974 and was appointed General Manager in April 1975. It is apparent that his services were utilised in the development of the draft disbursement scheme referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In May 1982 the Master in Equity in the NSW Supreme Court brought down a judgment which provided for disbursements by the liquidator to the organisations listed.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) I am informed by DAA that it has no information on its files which would determine how Mr Hall represented himself to each of the organisations in regard to his role in developing the disbursement scheme nor whether he had demanded and received a fee from each of the organisations for his services.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) On 3 December 1982 the New England Aboriginal Corporation informed DAA that it had made a payment of $2,890 to Mr Hall from its disbursement and provided a receipt, which it claimed supported the allegation. It also forwarded an unsworn statement which included the allegation that Mr Hall had requested the payment of $3,000 for his work and had sought a similar amount from Aboriginal organisations outside Sydney which had received the disbursements.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) See the answer to 6 and 7.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The documents provided by the New England Aboriginal Corporation were provided to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) which informed DAA that the matter was for consideration by the New South Wales police. The New England Aboriginal Corporation was informed of the AFP advice and its documents were returned should it wish to pursue its allegations with the State Police authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Neither I nor any of my staff who accompanied me during my visit to the Torres Strait in January 1988 nor Department of Aboriginal Affairs staff who were present, can recollect Mr Akee handing me any such documentation.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is it correct that if blind persons working in sheltered workshops have to go on workers' compensation, then the total value of any payments they are receiving, such as sheltered employment allowances and/or a spouse's invalid pension, are subsequently reduced by the amount of their worker's compensation payment, resulting in anything up to a 50 per cent reduction in their total household income; if so, can this situation be justified on the grounds of equity and fairness, which underlie our Social Security system, or is this simply an anomaly in the legislation;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The effect of workers' compensation on blind recipients of sheltered employment allowance or invalid pension is no different from the effect on other invalid pensioners or sheltered employment allowees.</PARA>
<PARA> Successive Governments have maintained the principle of employer or insurer responsibility for work-related illness or injury. Hence, the exemption of permanently blind people from the income and assets tests otherwise applied to invalid pensioners and sheltered employment allowees, does not extend to exemption from the compensation deduction, preclusion and recovery provisions of the Social Security Act.</PARA>
