<TITLE>Vietnam: End of War List</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that the Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the End of War List, the case of the 2nd Lieutenant John Fraser, 3RAR be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tasmania, VHF, UHF Transmission</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned residents of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the mountainous terrain and geography of Tasmania makes VHF television transmissions the most suitable for the State;</PARA>
<PARA> That more than 30,000 Tasmanians will have to purchase new television receivers and new antennae if commercial television in the State is forced to change from the VHF to the UHF band;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request that the requirement by the Department of Transport and Communications to force Tasmania's two commercial television stations to change from the VHF to the UHF band by 1993 be immediately rescinded.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Housing: Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past six months we have stood back and accepted the increase in Home Loan interest rates. We were advised by the Government this increase was due to the Australian deficit, but in the last six months the deficit has not dropped in fact it has risen to the highest on record. Why therefore can't the interest rates be returned to the rate it was six months ago, as at 17% it is too unrealistic. Don't impose the burden on the Home Loan repayers only.</PARA>
<PARA> There are people being forced out of their homes today because when their Home Loans were considered and approved by the Banks and Building Societies all parties concerned budgeted for a realistic interest rate with some possible increase or decrease, but no one could be prepared for the massive increase in interest rates that has been forced upon us since January 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> Young people of this Country are being forced to postpone starting a much wanted Family as Home Loan repayments necessitate two incomes to pay the excessive Interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> Families of the people paying Home Loans are not going to forget so easily how hard this Government has made it to achieve the ``Australian Dream-Owning your own Home''. Just remember we are the people who voted this Government in and can quite easily vote it out of Government.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purposes of this Bill are:</PARA>
<PARA>to disallow the August 28 determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA>to amend the composition of the membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to provide for two of its members to have qualifications, knowledge and experience relevant to the pharmaceutical profession and industry; and</PARA>
<PARA>to provide that in the conduct of its inquiries the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal have regard to the need to ensure that variations in the Commonwealth price of any pharmaceutical benefits have the effect of facilitating the efficient and effective provision of national health services. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is currently in a state of crisis. It is imperative that in the health care interests of the community urgent action be taken to ensure that the delivery of pharmaceutical services is not placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is an essential part of Australia's health care system. For almost 40 years it has been one of the most stable and enduring parts of that system. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying principles of the PBS, the public subsidisation of the delivery of the most reliable and modern pharmaceuticals at affordable prices, with the maximum assistance going to those in greatest need, are basically as sound today as they were when the scheme was first implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that the PBS is without need of improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to the PBS which have been made in recent times, however, with the possible exception of the introduction of the Safety Net, have not served to deliver such improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has committed itself to the aim of ensuring access by the Australian community to necessary cost-effective prescribed medications. What it appears to be overlooking is that it cannot deliver this promise by itself.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs the assistance of community pharmacists to honour its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 28th August 1989, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal ruled that there be a reduction of $1.05 per prescription in the amount paid to pharmacists and the elimination of any mark-up on the cost of prescription goods. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the implementation of this decision, based on the findings of a highly questionable data base survey, will result in significant losses in remuneration and have a dramatic and detrimental impact on pharmacists' ability to deliver services to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Without appropriate remuneration pharmacists will inevitably be forced to reduce their staffing levels and stock holdings. As a result patients may face considerable delays in having their prescriptions filled. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the serious reservations expressed about the validity of the data base survey which covered only 0.3% of Australia's 5,600 pharmacies, the Government has supported the PBRT's determination because it will save money. </PARA>
<PARA> Government efforts to cutback on the cost of the PBS by reducing the level of its payments to pharmacists are misguided. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists cannot in any way be held responsible for the increases in the cost of the PBS which have occurred in recent years. They do not originate prescriptions, they only fill them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National Parties deplore the way in which the Government has adopted a ``them and us'' attitude towards pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is ignoring the fact that the success of the PBS is totally dependent upon the maintenance of a co-operative partnership between government and the pharmacists. It is reliant upon community pharmacies to discharge its obligations under the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this it is incumbent upon the Government and the Tribunal to provide pharmacists with a fair and reasonable level of remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> Population growth and the rising number of aged people in the community make increased demand for PBS services entirely predictable and inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the development and utilisation of new, more effective and more expensive therapeutic products will inevitably contribute to cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are two important points which the Government appears to be overlooking. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these is that money spent on pharmaceuticals can yield savings by way of lowering the need for even more expensive forms of treatment and care, such as hospitalisation and surgery. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is the prescribing practices of doctors which influence the demand for goods and services under the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these factors it is outrageous for the Government to act as if it is the pharmacists who are responsible for the rapidly escalating cost of the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has announced its intention to restructure community pharmacies. It is clear that in doing so it is motivated by a desire to reduce costs and that it expects to achieve this by reducing the number of pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an absolutely fallacious assumption. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the number of pharmacy outlets which contribute to the cost of the PBS, but the number and type of prescriptions which are written and dispensed.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of the Government's `restructuring' will see the inevitable closure of up to 1,000 pharmacies. These closures will be totally indiscriminate. They may involve small pharmacies in low socio-economic areas serving a high proportion of pensioners, and other low income earners, i.e. the biggest consumers of PBS services, or they may be large pharmacies operating with high overhead expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, it is imperative that amendments be made to the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to stop the rot which is undermining the whole fabric of the PBS and jeopardising patient care. </PARA>
<PARA> The disallowance of the Tribunal's August 28 determination is essential in order to avoid the wholesale and indiscriminate closure of pharmacies. Unless this determination is overturned it is clear that the aged, who are both the greatest users of the PBS and the least mobile members of our community, will be robbed of much needed access to high quality pharmaceutical services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has based its determination on a data base survey the validity of which has been widely challenged for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, the survey's findings were based on an extremely small sample. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 150 of Australia's 5,600 pharmacies, of which only 53 responded. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this insignificant statistical base, pharmacists believe that the methodology of the survey is unreliable and that it is fundamentally flawed because the figures used were out of date and the key costings, such as wages and rent, based on unrealistic figures. </PARA>
<PARA> But despite the fact that these reservations have been loudly and clearly expressed both the Tribunal and the Government have been prepared to accept the survey's results as the basis of the Tribunal's August 28 determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National Parties believe that such a travesty would not have occurred if members of the Tribunal had qualifications, knowledge and experience relevant to the pharmaceutical profession and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that we propose to alter the composition of the Tribunal so that it may reach its determinations on the basis of a genuine appreciation of the impact of its decisions on pharmacists' ability to deliver a high quality and comprehensive service. </PARA>
<PARA> Further improvements to the operation and outcome of the inquiries of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will also be achieved by the passage of our amendment to require the Tribunal to ensure that its inquiries take account of the need to facilitate the efficient and effective provision of national health care services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated its desire to develop a professional role for pharmacists, over and above the role they already fulfil in the dispensing of drugs, it must realise that the closure of 25 to 30 per cent of Australia's pharmacies will do nothing to assist in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> Those community pharmacists who manage to survive in what is now an extremely adverse climate will be reduced to the assembly line dispensing of prescriptions. They will have neither the time, nor the resources, to even maintain their current contribution towards counselling patients and participating in public education programs, let alone take on an expanded role in the delivery of health care. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the result of the implementation of the Tribunal's August 28 determination will be the decimation of community pharmacy as we now know it. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of pharmacy outlets and the reduction in services from those pharmacies which continue to fight to stay in business will impose considerable burdens on consumers, the majority of whom are elderly. Many people will be forced to travel considerable distances to reach a pharmacist and they will experience increasing delays in obtaining the medication they require. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not preparing to countenance such a situation and therefore urges the Senate to adopt these amendments to the National Health Act so that the Health care interests of the nation can be safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is well known that I opposed the amendment to the War Crimes Act 1945 from the outset. I regarded it as one of the most dangerous and badly drafted bills I had ever seen. Nevertheless, I think it is common ground that it is beyond reasonable doubt a number of atrocious war or genocide criminals of the World War II period are now residing in Australia. How many we do not know, but the really serious offenders would be relatively few. I think it is also common ground that the crimes against humanity committed during the second world war were as bad as any committed in the long history of man's inhumanity to man. But that is not the end of the problem; it is only the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Crimes Act, as amended last December, has a very large number of highly offensive characteristics. First of all it is retrospective, which is abhorrent in the criminal law. It is retrospective because it gave extraterritorial jurisdiction to Australian criminal law, and also introduced new offences unknown to Australian criminal law, and also introduced new offences unknown to Australian criminal law of the relevant period. Worse still, the international law on crimes against humanity that it purported to be enforcing did not exist at the relevant time. It was the position of Australia in 1945, when the Nuremberg Charter was being discussed, that crimes against humanity were not covered by international law, but should be dealt with under the laws of the country in which the offences were committed. Yet nearly all the alleged crimes which have been mentioned are crimes against humanity for which, as I said, there was no international law at the time they were committed, and I believe there is no satisfactory justification for Australia purporting to enforce non-existent international law. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that there is not now some international law covering crimes against humanity. In 1949 there was a series of Geneva Conventions covering the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field and at sea, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the protection of civilians. This was brought into Australian law in 1957, but it should be noted that it does not cover such matters as genocide, and it was not retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> Genocide was covered by a separate Convention of 1947, and ratification of this Convention was approved by an act of Parliament, the Genocide Convention Act of 1949. Presumably, it was felt that genocide committed inside Australia could be adequately dealt with by our existing laws, but it is important to note that it did not give any power to Australian courts to deal with genocide committed overseas, whether by Australian residents or by anyone else. These ratifications of conventions of 1947 and 1949 are, of course, post facto as far as the Second World War crimes are concerned. They did not comprise international law of the period the War Crimes Act deals with; for these crimes the accepted statement was the Nuremberg Charter, which did not deal with crimes against humanity except those connected with defined war crimes. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another objection to the War Crimes Act is its limited coverage. It covers only war crimes committed in Europe during the Second World War-a small part of one war which ended nearly half a century ago. What has happened to all the other wars? Since the Second World War there have been at least 70 wars, and 10 of them are still going on. In the last 60 years there must have been 100 million people killed in horrible crimes against humanity, yet nearly all of these are excluded from the War Crimes Act. What went on in Pol Pot's Cambodia, for instance, is as bad as anything that went on in Hitler's Germany, yet the Act does not cover these. If someone committed a war crime today in, say, Cambodia or Lebanon, and subsequently migrated to Australia, he could not be tried for those war crimes here. The Act does not cover them. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Second World War we have taken in migrants from all over the world, and the last thing we want is to have the battles of their homelands, whether it be the religious troubles in Northern Ireland, the disintegration of Lebanon, strife in occupied Palestinian territories, the tribal fighting in Africa, or any other of the world conflicts, brought here. The last thing we want is to have conflicts of their native lands-the bitterness, the atrocities, the charges and countercharges-refought in Australian courts. When people come to Australia we hope they leave the troubles of their homelands behind. That was what was behind the statement made by this Parliament, with only one dissenter, to the migrant community, that those migrants who have been allowed to make their homes and lives here must be allowed to live in security with new lives under the rule of law, and the time had come to close the chapter on the crimes of World War II. This pledge was given in 1961, 28 years ago. There was no suggestion that any alleged war criminals should be put on trial in Australia. The 1988 amendment to the War Crimes Act was a clear breaking of this pledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the possibility of World War II Australian airmen being liable for prosecution as war criminals on the grounds that some of their bombing attacks in Europe-Dresden in February 1945 for example-might have been held to include wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity, to use the words of the Nuremberg Charter. The amendment that the Senate incorporated-to say it is not an offence if the act was reasonably justified by the exigencies and necessities of the conduct of war-adds nothing. This is already covered under the Nuremberg Charter law of military necessity. I am not for a moment suggesting that our World War II bomber veterans should be charged. Of course they will not be charged. But what we are saying to them is, `The Australian Parliament regards what you did in the Second World War, under orders and under conditions of enormous danger and very heavy casualties, as a war crime; but don't worry, we won't prosecute you'. What sort of a country do we think we are?</PARA>
<PARA> How then did such an objectionable Bill ever pass our Parliament? The only serious argument advanced for it was that, whatever its legal weaknesses, it was necessary in order to allow justice to be meted out to a small number of horrible criminals who had migrated here in the confusion after the Second World War. There is no doubt, in my mind, that if there had been a free vote in the Senate, after the Senate had considered the Bill, its defects and its likely effect on our migrant community, the Bill would then have been overwhelmingly rejected. Nevertheless it was passed on party lines. </PARA>
<PARA> Objectionable though I thought the Act was, what has happened since it was passed has disturbed me even more. Recently the Attorney-General, Mr Bowen, said it was quite likely that no one would be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act, which, if true, destroys the only serious argument advanced for passing it. Worse still, the Head of the Special Investigations Unit, Mr Greenwood, QC, has been reported as being very pleased with the co-operation he has been receiving from the Communist Bloc countries of Eastern Europe in supplying evidence against Australian residents who fled or migrated to Australia from those countries. Mr Greenwood has also reached agreements with a number of these countries. The trouble is that these agreements deal exclusively with the problems of the prosecution. They make no arrangements for providing an effective defence. But surely if someone approaching 80 is to be charged with crimes committed, say in Ukraine in 1943, if he is to mount an effective defence he will need to be able to go to Ukraine and contact potential witnesses, who will need to have exit visas and a credible assurance that they will not be punished for giving defence evidence. The defendant, who under our law will be presumed to be innocent-even the War Crimes Act does not change the presumption of innocence-would need to be able to examine records and possibly the site of the alleged crime. Frankly, I do not see how any of this is likely to be possible, but if it is not done fair trials will be impossible, which is one of the arguments I used against the Bill when it was in the Senate. I think the whole business has become a sorry farce. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the decision of whether or not to prosecute does not rest with Mr Greenwood; instead, responsibility is with the Director of Public Prosecutions, and I have no doubts as to the integrity of that office. I am sure he would not allow prosecutions to be launched unless there was a reasonable chance both of a conviction and of a fair trial, and for that reason I cannot believe any prosecutions will be launched. Some people have been talking about the desirability of having show trials to bring home to the Australian people the depths of man's inhumanity to man, even though there was no likelihood of the accused actually being convicted. If that were a desirable objective, one would have to ask why these show trials should be limited to one particular area of one particular war which ended nearly 50 years ago. But in any case show trials are abhorrent to our legal system, and I am quite sure that the Director of Public Prosecutions would never contemplate cooperating in one. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these reasons I think that the Government should immediately close down the Special Investigations Unit, and stop wasting the millions of dollars that have been spent on this exercise. It would also stop the tensions that are being caused in our migrant community. We must remember that since the Second World War we have taken in 150,000 migrants from Germany and 400,000 from Eastern Europe and the investigations of the Special Investigations Unit have already been extremely disruptive in these communities, many of which are fierce opponents of communism, having experienced it first hand. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask why I am bringing forward this Bill, because quite clearly it will not be passed unless the Government has a change of heart, either by permitting a free vote in this Parliament on this complex legal, moral and social issue, or by accepting its having made a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of my Bill is to focus attention on what is going on in this war crimes area, on what is going wrong in this area, and in the hope that by focusing community attention on this deplorable business, to put pressure on the Government to act in the way that its-or at any rate an overwhelming proportion of its members-know to be right, and repeal the deplorable War Crimes Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night we were considering Opposition amendments Nos 34, 35, 36 and 37. I was supporting my colleague Senator Peter Baume and pointing out certain matters to Senator Coulter, who had some objections to the Opposition's amendments. Senator Coulter pointed out a contrary point of view to the Democrat position that Aboriginal people had placed a different significance on the ownership of land. I pointed out then that I believed that Senator Coulter and Senator Tate had missed the point of the Opposition's amendment. What the Opposition is saying is that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will have a budget of around $800m to administer all needs and to fund all Aboriginal projects and that under the legislation at the moment a very significant proportion of that $800m could be used to acquire land. In fact, most of that money could be used to purchase land if the commissioners of ATSIC wanted to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are saying that many other needs have to be administered by ATSIC, for example, roads, health services and legal services. The legislation, without amendment, would give the Commission almost an unlimited right to spend that $800m in acquiring land. The Opposition is saying that there has to be some other direction that this money can be used to fund other Aboriginal projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for being so explicit about his concerns. If it were the case that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission spent the whole of its funds-which he modified late last night to say `a substantial proportion' of its funds-in the acquisition of land, then there could be some diminution in the services that would otherwise be provided in relation to the provision of fresh water, health services and all those other requirements of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that ought properly to be met out of the moneys appropriated by this Parliament for ATSIC. I think that is the key term-`appropriated by this Parliament for ATSIC'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell does not give sufficient weight to the fact that the appropriation made by this Parliament requires an estimates procedure. It requires the estimates to be provided in such detail as the Minister requires to be put to him for his consideration and, of course, they would be open to scrutiny by the Estimates committee of this chamber. In that way the sort of total disproportionate funding of that element of their function which allows for the acquisition of land to the detriment of other Aboriginal programs, I believe, would not survive the test-the scrutiny by the Minister of the estimates. Certainly it would be open to much criticism in the Estimates committees of the Senate chamber itself. </PARA>
<PARA> More fundamentally, Senator Boswell seems to be going against the tenor of his contribution to this important debate so far, because he does not seem to be putting enough confidence in the ability of the commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to get the balance right. He has said time and time again that occasionally they will make wrong decisions. Perhaps they might spend a fraction more than Senator Boswell would if he were a commissioner in relation to the provision of sewerage services, the provision of some sort of health scheme, or the acquisition of land. By the way, that is at market prices, out on the open market. We are not talking about the compulsory acquisition of land. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to those matters, we expect the Commission, fundamentally, given the tasks that it has to perform and the various matters which it might undertake on behalf of its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities, to do its best to devote its funds in a way which, not necessarily in any one year, but over a period of time, gets the balance right. It would be very wrong to try to circumscribe in advance the sort of devotion of funds that it would wish to make to these programs. That scrutiny of its allocation of funds will come through the proper Estimates procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister really has opened up an argument now because he says we must have confidence in the commissioners. But last night the Minister would not accept that argument from us when we said that one way to express that confidence in commissioners was to give them the right to appoint their own chief executive officer. We have gone around and around this. I remind the Committee that this is the same Committee that last week gave to the Aboriginal Development Commission the right to appoint its own chief executive. We agree with the Minister that we have to have confidence in the commissioners. That is not at question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are saying to the Minister is that the amendments we have proposed, we believe, will enable the achievement of the very outcome which the Minister identified in his last few remarks. The words we have added do not in any way seek to prevent the acquisition of land or the making of grants for the purchase of interest in land. They simply say that it should be done for certain purposes. Let me go back over what the Minister said. Certain amounts of the ATSIC budget will be designated for land acquisition or for loans or grants functions. When we get the estimates in the Parliament they will be identified. What Senator Boswell is saying is that we want to be sure that a commissioner does not use those moneys for what is essentially a political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> We have moved four amendments together for several purposes. Firstly, we want to try to be economical with time if we can, and this is one way to go about it. Secondly, as Senator Coulter pointed out last night-I think the Minister also pointed it out-the last two of those four amendments are the substantial ones and those which contain the argument. The first two amendments are, as it were consequential or associated amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter raised last night a quite important point that requires an answer. He wanted to know when we said `occupy land' whether we were being in a philosophical sense exploitative, whether we were looking at land as something that must be used economically. I take his point, but we were not doing that. In our minds we have a fairly broad and generous interpretation of the words `occupy land'. After all, I have administered the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in my time and I am well aware of the breadth of interpretation that may have to apply to the term `occupy land'. We made a grant of the Tanami Desert. I am not suggesting that there have to be houses there and people living there all the time. If Senator Coulter is unhappy with the word `occupy', I just say to him that we are not trying to use it in an exploitative sense; we are not suggesting that it implies or requires the economic use of the land. We are not suggesting that it has to be turned into citrus orchards, that it has to be used for grazing cattle, or whatever. If that is what comes across it is unfortunate. Perhaps the honourable senator could help us with a word that better describes what is in our minds. The amendments make it quite clear that we are not opposing the function but we are concerned about what wilful or foolish commissioners might do. After all, we have a responsibility in the Parliament to put into the statute what we want people to read and follow later on. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter. People ask why we would wish to tie the hands of the commissioners if they chose to devote a large amount of their resource to land acquisition as we have suggested they might do. I digress to say that, as clause 15 is written, it will be quite competent for the commissioners, using the phrase `on such terms and conditions as the Commission determines' to say to an Aboriginal corporation, `We will make a grant to such and such an Aboriginal corporation to acquire interests in some land which will then be registered in the name of', and the Commission can then name anyone it wishes. It could be a land council; it may not be the organisation itself. As we read the clause, there will be a capacity for the Commission, on such terms and conditions as it determines, to go about this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I get back to the point I wanted to make. Many honourable senators have drawn attention in the second reading debate to the extreme degree of need and deprivation that characterises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their communities. I drew attention in the second reading debate on the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill, and my colleague Senator Boswell has a particular interest in the Torres Strait, to the recent press report which featured the chief medical officer on Thursday Island. He is appalled at the health status of the people in Port Kennedy. Given the degree of deprivation and need, I would like to see the commissioners at least giving a priority to overcoming that deprivation and need. All we are saying is that if they wish to put money in quite substantial amounts into the acquisition of property, it should be in some way for the benefit of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The theory of opportunity cost is known to all honourable senators. Not every dollar that goes into property can go into providing Senator Coulter's sewerage line in Western Australia-or whatever the example was that we have been using throughout this committee stage debate. After all, our amendments propose that the Commission should be able to make grants for the acquisition of interests in land and personal property as the Commission considers appropriate for the purpose of enabling Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those corporations to occupy that land. We added the words `who are members of those corporations' because if a grant is made to corporation X we want it at least to be understood it is for the benefit of the members of corporation X. We cannot see why that amendment will not improve the legislation. It will not prevent the activity being undertaken by the Commission. It merely says that if the Commission does that it must be for the benefit of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people who are members of that corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way, amendment No. 36, the preceding one, the other substantial amendment, merely seeks to add the words `for the purpose of enabling Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those corporations to occupy that land'. Again I say to Senator Coulter-and I am interested in what he will say-that if his interpretation of the word `occupy' is that it is exploitative, I seek his assistance in finding a better word. Without those words there is no limit on the ways in which commissioners might utilise that part of the ATSIC budget which comes within this functional area to acquire land and property at large and, in so doing, because of the opportunity costs involved, ignoring the needs and interests of other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not argue for the other two amendments because I think we have all agreed that these are the two more substantial ones, but I urge the committee to give sympathetic and considerate attention to what we have argued and to the Opposition amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid I must say to Senator Peter Baume that, while I found some of his earlier arguments really quite persuasive in dealing with other clauses, in relation to amendments Nos. 36 and 37 I do not find any persuasion at all in what he said. I really do find these amendments quite objectionable, and the inclusion of the word `occupy', despite what Senator Baume says, does connote physical occupation and/or exploitation of the land. I do not really think one can get around that implication if this were ever to be tested in a court of law further down the track. If one were to leave out not only the word but the sorts of connotations which I think Senator Peter Baume agrees should not be in there, then there ceases to be a great deal of point in the amendment that he is seeking to put in because the sense of it would mean that the Commission may, on such terms and conditions as it determines, make grants of money to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations for the acquisition of interests in land in the interests of the Aboriginal people or Islanders within those corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely that is implicit in the whole idea that the Commission can buy the land. It would buy the land in the interests of those people. So it seems to me that if one takes out the concept of occupy or the concepts to which Senator Baume agrees, we might find some objection. If that is taken out, then there seems very little point because all one is doing is putting in a tautology. But beyond that I come back to the point that I made last night, and that is, let us recognise that as a society we have created a situation in which many wealthy people in this country can buy and sell and speculate in land and there is absolutely massive misallocation of resources in terms of what really needs to be done in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of government in this country has largely been the protection of a system in which certain classes of people have been able to buy and sell land and speculate and do all sorts of things so that as a society the effect has been that there has been massive misallocation of resources away from areas of needs. It does not necessarily follow that if we were genuinely concerned that Aboriginal people under ATSIC may also misallocate resources, therefore we should countenance it just because this misallocation has been countenanced in other parts of society. That does not follow. However, it does follow that we should be very careful about pointing the finger at the Aboriginal people who might finish up on ATSIC and say, `Look, you might be naughty; you might buy land when in fact you should be building these sewerage lines in Western Australia'. Let us recognise that as a society we have not done very well in the way we have allocated the resources that are available. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I would make is that ATSIC of course will be under scrutiny and should it go excessively in the direction of buying land for speculative purposes or purposes other than the welfare of Aboriginal people, clearly that is something that can be picked up. Frankly, I think the Opposition is drawing a very long bow here when it talks about the possibility of ATSIC spending virtually all its money on land acquisition and totally ignoring the plight of its own people. This will be a representative body drawn from Aboriginal people all over Australia. Surely the whole point about this is that these Aboriginal people know the needs of the local communities; they will, in formulating the ATSIC draft budget, have before them the draft budgets of the regional councils; there will be the bids in there from the regional councils in relation to their needs. I think it is extremely unlikely that the sorts of bizarre and excessive examples to which Senator Baume is pointing us would in fact happen. I think it is very unlikely. For all those reasons I find amendments Nos (36) and (37) really quite objectionable. As we all have agreed, if they go then the first amendment in this series, No. (34), probably becomes irrelevant anyway and it may well be that No. (35) is one which could go in; but perhaps, as I indicated last night, Senator Baume would not want to proceed with it if Nos (36) and (37) were not accepted. I certainly do not find them acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coulter. I understand what he said. I do not want to prolong the debate unduly in the light of what he said, but there are several points I will make in response. First, scrutiny is one thing, but it is fairly meaningless if the statute is not drawn optimally. We had a rather distressing time in 1988 watching and scrutinising certain actions by some ADC commissioners who were able to ignore everyone because the statute did not require them to respond. I could take the Senate through all the disasters of last year-the Woden Town Club, the Oasis Hotel and a few other things-but I will not do that. I imagine that members of the Committee can remember, as I can, some of those events. Our job, if we are to do it properly, is to try to get the statute right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Coulter takes a different view; I am not going to go over and over the same points. I will just say that, without the amendment the Opposition has proposed, the Bill could authorise ATSIC, if it was so minded, to become itself or to finance selected Aboriginal corporations actually to become traders in and holders of land. If Senator Coulter is concerned about the speculative activity that has gone on, I point out to him that, if we agree to this clause as written, there could be Aboriginal corporations themselves trading in land and themselves being part of that speculation. I can, of course, draw upon the Aboriginal Development Commission Act as the model from which we work. The purpose of acquiring land, we believe, ought to be expressly stated, as it is in section 23 of the ADC Act. The Opposition is not suggesting something that is unique or new; we are suggesting something that should be carried over from the existing ADC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, we believe that amendment 35 actually has some merit on its own. Senator Coulter's last comment was that he did not know whether we would wish to proceed with that amendment on its own. We think it has some merit on its own. The Government gave us some cautious support for that amendment. Depending on how things run, we will ask that that amendment be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to suggest, Mr Temporary Chairman, that we proceed as follows. Amendments 36 and 37 actually have two legs to them. The first leg is that the grants should be for the benefit of members of the corporations, and the second leg of the amendments is that they should then occupy the land. The Clerk looks puzzled, but I will read it:</PARA>
<PARA>for the purpose of enabling Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of the corporations to occupy the land. </PARA>
<PARA>They are, in fact, two elements in the amendments. Senator Coulter has said to us that he finds offensive particularly the provision in the words `occupy the land'. The Opposition, for reasons which I have set out and will not repeat, wishes to press those amendments. Should we be unsuccessful, I will then invite the Committee to look at a more limited form of words, picking up only some words such as those used by Senator Coulter a moment ago, words which might mean that the acquisition must be made in the interests of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are members of the corporations, because we believe that is part of what the amendments are trying to achieve and at least we would try to get that. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I would repeat that we would like to get amendment No. 35 agreed to. I therefore suggest, Mr Temporary Chairman, in the light of the debate, that you divide the question, to put amendments Nos. 34, 36 and 37 together, to put No. 35 separately, and, depending upon the outcome of the vote that may ensue, I may come back with another suggestion. Perhaps I might ask, through the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), whether, as the Second Parliamentary Counsel is sitting there, having heard what I intend, he might try to help me get it in some appropriate form. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That amendments Nos (34), (36) and (37) (Senator Peter Baume's) be agreed to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I foreshadow those two amendments. In terms of what Senator Coulter read out, I indicated words like `in the interests of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people'. The Parliamentary Counsel tells us that the words that have been selected are words that appear fairly frequently-they are standard words that appear in clauses of statutes. Senator Coulter has said to me that they may be, as it were, almost unnecessary, but the concerns of the Opposition were twofold. Those words would in fact meet one of our concerns. The Committee has decided not to meet the other. We accept that, and will not go back over it. But the words that I have proposed and which have been prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel-for which I thank her-would in fact meet part of the concern of the Opposition. It would mean that any land or interest in property that was acquired would be in the interests of and for the purpose of advancing-using the words that were used there; it is fairly widely drawn-the interests of people who are members of those corporations. That at least would give to us some comfort and we believe in the long run might lead to better outcomes for Aboriginal people in terms of the great unmet need to which we have all referred during this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.51)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I cannot see that those words add anything to the meaning of the words that we have in front of us in the Bill. Nor do they constrain the Commission in the way in which I think Senator Baume is intending they should constrain the Commission. If, for instance, he is concerned about speculative activity, it seems to me it could certainly be argued that within those words a corporation could still buy, sell and speculate in land. It could certainly be argued at times when land prices are rising rapidly that speculation in land is in the interests of the Aboriginal people in that community. I do not feel that the words add anything, nor do they actually curtail the activity of the Commission in the way in which I think Senator Baume is seeking to curtail the powers of the Commission with respect to the acquisition of property. They just seem to be unnecessary, tautological and ineffectual.</PARA></TALK.START>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="1039" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.52)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter has said that this will not prevent speculative activity. I say to Senator Coulter that it was he who raised the problem of speculative activity. That was not part of our argument in chief. He says that this will not stop it; that may be so. But that has not been our main concern. Our main concern has been to look at the differences between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation in this matter and the Aboriginal Development Commission Act, and to say, `Why has this happened?'. As I pointed out last night, in clause 88 of the ATSIC Bill we find what an Aboriginal corporation is. It is any body corporate owned or controlled by Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We come back to clauses 14 and 15, which provide that ATSIC could make grants of interest in property to any Aboriginal corporation for any purpose-that is, other than a business purpose, which is dealt with elsewhere in clause 14 (4). That is what is stated. I reminded the Committee last night that corporations could include each of the regional councils themselves; they could become landholders. It could include the Northern Territory land trusts or land councils. It could include the New South Wales land councils. It could include bodies such as the Aboriginal Coalition, which is a land rights body. It could include the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation. It could include Aboriginal legal, medical and other services. It could include an Aboriginal shelf company. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that very wide group of bodies which would be permitted, if one considers clause 88 together with clauses 14 and 15, to acquire interests in land, these words in fact do assist. The words proposed to be added as an amendment to both clause 14 and clause 15 are `for the purpose of furthering the economic, social and cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those corporations'. The words can do no harm at all. The Opposition believes they can do some good. We believe that they will assist in reassuring a number of people who are concerned about some of the intentions of land councils. </PARA>
<PARA> A former Premier of a State north of here with whom I had to negotiate extensively some years ago was concerned at every meeting that there may be a de facto land rights program being developed under his nose. We were able to reassure him because we were working at that stage under the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. We were able to point to sections of the Act and he agreed that they did give him reassurance. As a result, as Senator Jones would recall, there was a fair amount of land acquisition possible in that State. The States are sovereign in matters of land acquisition. A State tomorrow, if it were worried, could determine that no-one with red hair could own or purchase property in certain areas. The States are quite sovereign in the area of land acquisition. We believe that these words would help to assist former Premiers, such as the one with whom I dealt, and would help to reassure a number of people who are concerned that there is some hidden purpose in the provision written as it is and in the fact that it has been varied from the provision in the ADC Act. It can do no harm. The Opposition believes it could help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, the Opposition is now moving what we should term a fallback position by inserting after the word `Corporation' the words `for the purpose of furthering the economic, social and cultural development of the Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those Corporations'. What Senator Baume is saying is that under the legislation as it now stands any organisation or corporation, no matter for what reason it is set up-health or legal or any other Aboriginal instrumentality-can become an investor in land and can acquire land. That is not the purpose of these Aboriginal instrumentalities. They are there to fulfil a need in the Aboriginal community. They are there to provide health services and legal aid-some sort of service to the Aboriginal community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator Coulter</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And in doing that they may need to buy land.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter rightly raises the point that to provide those services they may need to acquire land. We do not object to that. Our amendment says that if it is in the best interests of those organisations, if it is for the purpose of furthering the economic, social or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are members of those corporations, then we agree. If that is required to further the interests of that particular organisation, then they should buy the land, but they should not buy the land just to have a great swag of land out there because they particularly like to have land. That is not going to further the interests of Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter seems to be arguing against himself now. He was the one who made the statement that many people exploit land for various reasons, and I think he mentioned that the wealthy people in Australia have the right to buy, hold or do whatever they like with land. We are saying quite categorically that if it is in the interest of Aboriginal communities to own land, or if it is going to further their economic development, they should buy it. But they should not spend a huge part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) budget on acquiring land and not developing the services that are required to be given to the Aboriginal communities. I do not see how Senator Coulter can mount a genuine argument against the amendment that Senator Peter Baume has just presented to the Committee. If he does mount such an argument, he is really arguing against his last statement to the Committee about five or six minutes ago. I hope Senator Coulter can support the Opposition amendment. It certainly cannot do any harm. It does put down guidelines; they are not as strong as the Opposition would like, but they are certainly better than no guidelines at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Coulter knows the direction in which the Opposition is heading. We want that part of the budget that is allocated by taxpayers of Australia to be spent serving the needs of Aboriginal communities, whether it is spent on a hypothetical sewerage project in Western Australia or in various areas of roads, health, or legal aid. But the legislation should not state that any part of the budget can be spent on land because that is not the purpose of ATSIC. The purpose of ATSIC is self-determination, self-management and the allocation of the money for the needs of Aboriginal people. Those needs include not only a requirement for land, but also a delivery of services in various areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (38) Page 77, clause 199, lines 14 to 25, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chairman, amendment No. 38 refers to clause 199, which is to be found at page 77 of the Bill. Honourable senators would be aware that this was clause 198 in the former print of the Bill. This clause concerns the staff of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and states that they are to be public servants. We have included this amendment as a grouping on its own; it is the only reference we make to Aboriginal Hostels in the amendments and it is necessary to refer to them only once. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause has three subclauses. Subclause (1) says:</PARA>
<PARA>The staff required to assist Aboriginal Hostels Limited . . . shall . . . be persons appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA>Subclause (2) says:</PARA>
<PARA>The General Manager of Aboriginal Hostels Limited has all the powers of, or exercisable by, a Secretary under the Public Service Act 1922, so far as those powers relate to the branch of the Australian Public Service comprising the staff referred to in subsection (1) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, giving the General Manager of Aboriginal Hostels the capacity to act as if he were a Public Service employer. Subclause (3) says:</PARA>
<PARA>In spite of subsection (2), Aboriginal Hostels Limited shall be taken not to be a Department for the purposes of Part VII of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>So the effect of this, apparently, is that the staff of Aboriginal Hostels are to be made public servants, but Aboriginal Hostels is not to be a department of the Public Service-quite specifically provided for by subsection (3). </PARA>
<PARA> In order to try to understand what the Government was doing and why it was doing it, I turned to the explanatory memorandum. And remarkably unhelpful it was. It merely restates, in simple language, the three things I have told the Committee. It merely says that the staff would be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act; it merely says that the General Manager would have all the powers exercisable by a secretary under the Public Service Act in relation to such staff; and it says that subclause (3) would ensure that Aboriginal Hostels Ltd would not be required to comply with the requirements of Part VII of the Audit Act that apply to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> That is really very unhelpful, because the issue the Opposition wishes to raise is this: Aboriginal Hostels Ltd is another one of these long-standing portfolio agencies with a very long, proud and successful history. Aboriginal Hostels Ltd has operated successfully under its charter now for more than 15 years. I recall it has had some very distinguished directors. I believe Miss Lois O'Donohue has been the Chair of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd in recent times, and there is no Australian more distinguished than she. She was Australian of the Year a few years ago. In all that time one of the things that have characterised Aboriginal Hostels Ltd is that it has enjoyed the flexibility of employing people, particularly Aboriginal people-and the word `flexibility' is important here-under private sector conditions. It has been possible for them to create employment packages which have been necessary for certain of the people they have employed who in fact may not have been comfortable or happy being employed only under the Public Service Act. The Public Service Act, while it confers benefits, also has some disadvantages to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The question I put to the Committee is: Why is this change being made? Aboriginal Hostels, as I say, has been successful. It has operated within its budget, and its measure of success has been in outcomes so that every night of the year there are thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually in the hostels, being housed. So it is successful in the sense of achieving outcomes, and after this time the Government has decided these people should become public servants. The question we are entitled to ask is why. Why is this necessary? There is no evidence available to the Opposition that the Aboriginal Hostels Ltd board has been consulted on the proposed change in the status of its employees; certainly there is no evidence that it was consulted in advance, unless it happened in some of those portfolio meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter will remember, and Senator Boswell will recall, that when we were conducting the inquiries for the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs we did spend some time considering the position of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. We were unable then to get any expression of view from Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. That was fine and that was its right, but I refer my colleagues to paragraphs 3.48 and 3.49 of our unanimous report where we drew attention to these matters. There is no evidence that the employees have been consulted; there is no evidence that the Public Service trade unions have been consulted. Indeed, if they have been consulted we do not know what the view of the trade union movement is on this matter. I come back to the Minister and say to him again: there is a long history of successful operation by Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, during a period when it enjoyed the flexibility of producing employment conditions for its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees-and it is an almost completely Aboriginalised agency. </PARA>
<PARA> So, given that record and given that Aboriginal Hostels Ltd has been able to operate within its budget, has been able to achieve the outcomes which to me are so important, and given that it has actually fulfilled its charter, the question is: why is it necessary now to make this change and to bring these employees under a different system of employment merely because ATSIC has been created? The Government has put this clause in because it feels it is necessary for that end to be achieved, but without this clause it would be possible for what was a successful and satisfactory arrangement to continue. It is for that reason that the Opposition proposes that the clause should be omitted. We are not in any way trying to make life more difficult for Aboriginal Hostels Ltd; on the contrary, we are trying to make life easier, trying to leave with Aboriginal Hostels Ltd the flexibility which it has enjoyed and used for 15 years. We believe the amendment, unless it is justified-and it has not been justified publicly up to now-simply is not worth keeping in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that in the last 12 months there has been very extensive scrutiny of the whole Aboriginal affairs portfolio. A number of very important inquiries have been conducted principally arising from evidence to the Senate Estimates Committee of either maladministration of major financial areas that needed to be addressed. I remind the Senate that Aboriginal Hostels Ltd has never come in for criticism in any of the extensive scrutiny of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. In fact, on the contrary, the evidence given by Aboriginal Hostels to the Senate Estimates Committees has been complimented by senators on the Estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the amendment moved by Senator Peter Baume. Aboriginal Hostels has been, along with the Institute, probably one of the most successful agencies in the whole area of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. As Senator Peter Baume has so rightly pointed out, it has a unique social function. It has operated administratively most efficiently and effectively. Financially it has operated with full accountability and has not ever been called into question. The presentations it has made to the Senate Estimates Committees, with the explanatory memoranda, on the activities it conducts for the thousands of Aboriginal people who need to utilise the services of Aboriginal Hostels have been praised and complimented by the Senate and, therefore, by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I find it very strange that the Government is pursuing this approach of putting all the employees of Aboriginal Hostels under the umbrella of the Public Service Act. I think we need to look very carefully at the functions of Aboriginal Hostels and the nature of many of its employees. It is providing basically a hotel-motel-hostel and counselling type service to many people that require special accommodation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very true. I am certainly familiar with that in the Northern Territory and with the very good role that it plays in that regard. The employees that work for Aboriginal Hostels on many occasions will be casual employees. Whether they are in management positions or whether they are employed in domestic and other functions, they will by nature be part time in many instances. They will often have to have special contracts. They sometimes will be people that are related to the management or closely related to the communities in which they serve. If we impose on Aboriginal Hostels all of the constraints and requirements of the Public Service Act, I believe we would be removing from Aboriginal Hostels the very flexibility of operation that has guaranteed its success. I therefore fully support the amendments proposed by Senator Peter Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too support this amendment that staff of Aboriginal Hostels should not have to be public servants to obtain a position in the hostels. I cannot understand this legislation seeking to change an Aboriginal instrumentality that has worked so successfully for 15 years. It seems that we are asking for change for change's sake. Hostels have worked well. They provide a very efficient and very good service. I have never stayed at one of the hostels but I have certainly been to them on many occasions. One that comes to mind is the Abigail Ban Hostel at Port Kennedy on Thursday Island that services the Islander people as they come in from the outer islands. I think that is where the Senate Committee had its meeting. I have been there for functions and for meals on numerous occasions and it is really well run. I know that employees of the Abigail Ban hostels and other Aboriginal hostels do, on occasions, work on broken hours, broken shifts. There is part time employment being offered. This will all be put at risk if we do not give the hostels the mobility to run their own organisations. For instance, they may have a particular function for a visiting dignitary. The community may wish to put on a function that will require the hostels to employ three or four extra people to provide the catering and cleaning facilities. All that will be put at risk if this Parliament insists that the hostels must employ people under the Public Service Act. It is taking away the flexibility that has made hostels so successful over the last 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot understand why, if things run successfully, this Government seems to say on a number of issues, `Things are running well. Let's see what we can do to stop it running well. Let's see whether we can provide some barrier, so that we can make sure that if something has worked for 15 years we can do something to stop it working successfully'. The Minister must give us a decent explanation and not just some Labor Party philosophy on why we have to change something that has been so successful for a number of years and change it to take away that flexibility of hostels being able to function in the way that they have and provide such excellent services to the Aboriginal and Islander communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that the way in which the Aboriginal Hostels Ltd (AHL) has provided services in the past will be jeopardised by the intended manner of its organisation or the coverage by the Public Service Act of its staff that is proposed by the Government. In fact, in relation to the Institute, for example, once again it operated in a way which the whole of this Senate wanted to see continue as far as its integrity and its autonomy and so on were concerned. We have passed the second reading and various amendments to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill, where the Opposition did not challenge the fact that its staff were to become members of the Public Service. They found that that was not incompatible with the expectation they have that the Institute should continue to deliver the requirements of its charter with the high excellence which we have seen in the past, and I am sure that will continue with Aboriginal Hostels Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed there has been consultation, of course, with Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. It will be recalled that the original proposal was that Aboriginal Hostels Ltd be somehow merged into ATSIC. That was resisted and led to the solution which makes it clear that the status of the Aboriginal Hostels under the ATSIC umbrella-to put it that way-does not submerge the personality, the hard-won goodwill and reputation, which Aboriginal Hostels Ltd has built up, and for that reason Aboriginal Hostels Ltd has welcomed the manner in which the hostels are to be run within the framework of the legislation that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the members of staff at the hostels are concerned, Senator Boswell and others seem to think that because they become members of the Public Service that will somehow be to their disadvantage. On the contrary, of course: what it will do will be to allow those staff members, having acquired a certain level of skills and expertise and ability, to show their capacity to undertake the sort of work that they are allocated at whatever level within the provision of services by Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. They will of course gain the ability to work themselves out of that area of the Public Service into other areas. It may be that they will then be able to get the opportunity to move into perhaps a program administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training or the Department of Social Security or whatever, and thus have a greater mobility than they have at the moment to use those skills which have come to fruition under the initial employment they have undertaken with Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. I believe that that would explain why, as far as I know, the staff have not indicated any unhappiness with this proposal. I am sure that their unions would be protecting their terms and conditions and the ways in which they will be working within the description of section 199. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the unions support the proposals. After negotiations with the unions it has been agreed that staff of AHL in non-administrative roles will be engaged as continuing employees under the Public Service Act but under separate awards agreed with the unions. So it seems that the unions protecting the interests of the staff have managed to reach a position where they can go to their members and secure their support for this notion that they should be engaged as continuing employees under separate awards agreed with the unions. I am sure that that sort of protection afforded by their unions explains the fact that, as the advisers tell me, there has been no dissatisfaction expressed by the Aboriginal Hostels Ltd organisation in regard to the manner in which section 199 proposes to treat the staff of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No views of any kind. I accept Senator Baume's correction. If I remember correctly, we actually had to go to Hostels and ask it what its opinion was. It did not volunteer any views at all. In considering this matter, we are not dealing with an area in which there has been strong lobbying one way or the other, and it is therefore necessary to make some objective assessment as to the merits of the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister two questions. Is it the intention of the Government in putting in this clause that employees of Aboriginal Hostels gain the flexibility within the Public Service that they hitherto lacked? He implied that they would gain that, but I wonder whether that was the intention. I accept that that is a legitimate intention and there would be an advantage to some Aboriginal people to be able to move into other areas of the Public Service. One other matter which Senator Baume raised-it might have been Senator Tambling; I am not sure-was the matter of part time employees. I am not familiar with the Commonwealth Public Service Act, but certainly in the South Australian State Public Service Act-because I worked under that Act for many years-there is quite adequate provision for the employment of part time people. That is quite adequately covered within the ambit of the Act and does not create problems at all. I ask for the Minister's assurance on that matter also: that the casual or part time employment of Aboriginal people by Hostels if this clause is inserted will not be put in jeopardy in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be possible for the staff of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd to enjoy the flexibility within the Public Service that I indicated. It is certainly the intention of this provision to permit that to happen. As far as part time, casual and other forms of employment are concerned they would be subject to the awards which are negotiated on behalf of the staff by the unions concerned. I have indicated that agreement has been reached that in non-administrative roles the continuing employee category under the Public Service Act will be utilised under separate awards agreed with the unions. I am quite sure that gives the scope which would permit that variation in the types and duration of employment to be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an old rule from New England-I think I have mentioned it before in this place-`If it ain't broke don't fix it', and that really underpins what the Opposition is trying to say. We are looking at something that ain't broke. In fact, it operates very well. Some of the arguments advanced by the Minister really do not hold up to any kind of analysis. The Minister says that it will be easier in some ways for people to move within the Public Service. People who work for Aboriginal Hostels Ltd today can apply for appropriate positions in the Public Service if they have the extra qualification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Minister was not acknowledging, and what Senator Tambling did draw our attention to, is that many of these employees are part time employees, as it were, in the hotel-motel industry. They are cleaners, they make beds, they are housemaids, they are cooks; they are people for whom flexibility in employment is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> For 15 years Aboriginal Hostels have developed mechanisms by which it has employed these people; it has given maximum opportunity to Aboriginal and Islander people who may not otherwise have had employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aboriginal Hostels has used the various government training schemes, such as those offered by DEET. When we went to Aboriginal Hostels, it was not quite as Senator Coulter said. It gave us no information. The response from Aboriginal Hostels, I seem to recall, was that the matter would be considered at its next board meeting. That was the extent of input we got from Aboriginal Hostels on the whole Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission matter. That is okay, that is their right. I am not worrying about that. But we received no documentary input of any kind. At no stage did the Minister outline negotiations on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Aboriginal Hostels, under its existing arrangement, has operated effectively, with great flexibility and with great distinction over 15 years. The change which is proposed, we believe, is unnecessary and is likely to be unhelpful in the longer term. Since it is more akin to a hotel-motel industry situation, we cannot see what benefit will accrue to these employees if they are brought under the Public Service Act. We think their circumstances will not be improved. We think their circumstances are likely to be slightly more difficult. We cannot see, in the light of the very good history of Aboriginal Hostels, why we should support this clause. We therefore press the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope so, Madam Chair. Thank you for encouraging me to give it to Senator Boswell. The fact is that under section 82-I do not have it in front of me-of the Public Service Act there is provision for casual and part time employment. But I would imagine that the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union covers many of the staff members who operate in the sorts of categories to which Senator Boswell has referred and it would be in that award that he would find the provisions that allow for the employment of those staff on proper terms and conditions. As I have indicated, separate awards and the membership and coverage of unions would be the basis on which the staff being taken on in the circumstances indicated by Senator Boswell would be protected in their employment terms and conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a very quick question to follow up. In some remote communities there may be a need to employ people rapidly for short times. Can the Minister tell us the flexibility that exists in the speed of employment and how much paperwork is necessary to put someone on under the Public Service Act 1922? We believe at the moment Aboriginal Hostels through its delegations gives to its local managers considerable flexibility and minimum bureaucracy. If in Port Kennedy, for example, there is a need to take on someone very suddenly who has not previously been in the Public Service-someone may be sick-we cannot see how Aboriginal Hostels would be able to do its job as effectively and we cannot understand how the Government can say that there will not be some loss of flexibility in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that the sorts of problems to which Senator Baume alludes would have been considered by that management team under Mr Clarke and had it felt that it could not deliver the services which are universally held to be of a very high standard it would have protested. If it has not it must think that it has the flexibility and the capacity to undertake the engagement of staff to deliver those services as required.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that Mr Clarke of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd has of course taken the primary responsibility, and it is his role, to discuss the structure that is proposed with the ATSIC task force, originally under Mr Gray. It came, after that early proposal about a full merger, to what one might call an amicable understanding that Aboriginal Hostels Ltd could work within the ATSIC umbrella. In fact, that is the term that Mr Clarke used in a letter of 28 November 1988 to Mr Gray, as chairman of the ATSIC task force. The letter reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Bill</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to confirm our discussion regarding status of AHL under the ATSIC umbrella. </PARA>

<PARA> The Company will however, continue to be supportive of ATSIC and will work with the Commission to achieve the best possible delivery of service to our client group. </PARA>
<PARA> Directors of AHL will welcome the agreed three ATSIC Commissioners to the Board of AHL at the appropriate time which will ensure a commonality in policy. </PARA>

<PARA> (41) Pages 16 and 17, clause 29, line 32 (page 16) to line 25 (page 17), leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Basis of holding office</PARA>
<PARA> ``29. (1) The Commission Chairperson holds office on a full-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) The other members of the Commission hold office on a part-time basis.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This group of amendments relates to the commissioners. Amendment No. 41 is an amendment to clause 29. Clause 29 at page 16 of the Bill concerns the basis on which commissioners will hold office. Indeed, the matter which concerns us is that of full time and part time commissioners. As the clause is written it says that the nonelected commissioners may be elected on a full time or part time basis. It says that the persons who are elected to the first round of zone elections shall all be appointed on a part time basis and that, subject to clause 4, the persons elected on subsequent zone elections shall be appointed on a part time basis. Then it goes on to give the Minister discretion to appoint people full time if that is what the Minister wishes to do. Let us talk theoretically. I am not using any ad homineum argument here, but there are good and bad Ministers in any government and governments come and go. To give a Minister the capacity to appoint someone full time gives that Minister a certain power of patronage. Proposed subclause (4) of clause 29 states:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary for the efficient performance of the Commission's functions . . . the Minister shall appoint those persons . . . on a full time basis. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister has a capacity if in his opinion he is satisfied that it is necessary to make some of the commissioners full time. The Opposition's amendment would say that we are quite satisfied that the Commission chairperson hold office on a full time basis. I will explain that. We think that the chairperson will occupy an enormously important, significant role. We have drawn upon our experience with the Aboriginal Development Commission and we are aware of the role which, say, Shirley McPherson had to fulfil and which she fulfilled with such distinction. It could not have been done properly, we believe, other than on a full time basis. If, as Senator Boswell says, and let us use the ball park figure, we are going to look at the availability of up to $800m a year-even if the figure is less it is a very substantial amount of resource-it is proper that there be a full time chairperson oversighting the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Puplick has quoted to the Senate before, if not to the committee, the old saying that we did not do away with the divine rule of kings to take on the divine rule of experts. We think that if we do not have a full time Commission chairperson we will in fact find the Commission is run not by the elected commissioners but by the Commission bureaucracy. We think that to have a full time Commission chairperson, as we have had with Shirley McPherson, is desirable. We think that is necessary and we do not see any reason why the other commissioners should be there full time. If the Government had some particular project it wished to be carried out, for example, when it wished to appoint Mr Pat Dodson to another position, it simply did so by a separate instrument. He was not moved over as an ADC commissioner from part time to full time employment. He was moved on to the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot see any reason why it would be necessary here to move commissioners from part time to full time employment. Certainly it retains flexibility. But the clause as it is drafted gives the Minister considerable discretion to decide who shall be full time and who shall be part time. To put it bluntly, any Minister would then be able to play favourites and say to someone, `You will be full time', or, `Whether you remain full time is a matter for my pleasure'. We think it is far better to have the statute state quite clearly what the situation should be. We believe that there should be a full time chairperson and part time commissioners. We think that is far more in accord with what the ADC has done fairly successfully. From my experience in the portfolio that is, I imagine, all that would be necessary. I cannot see why it is necessary to put in a provision for possible full time employment of the other commissioners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These provisions were put into section 29 of the proposed Act at the request of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, following extensive consultations by the Minister. This is an example of where the changes were made due to commitments given to Aboriginal communities as the Minister engaged in consultations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It probably would be the expectation that a chairperson of such a Commission, with such a range of functions and powers and such a budget, would be full time. But it may be that the best person possible cannot provide his or her services full time because of other obligations. It would be disabling to the Australian community to put in a provision which restrained and curtailed the capacity to make an appointment of such an outstanding person who may not, for one legitimate reason or another, be available for a full time appointment. It is simply a question of providing for flexibility in regard to that particular appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards subclause 4, I have confirmed that when instructions were given it was drafted by Parliamentary Counsel, on the basis that the Minister cannot pick or choose between commissioners and make some of the elected commissioners full time and leave some part time. As the clause reads, if the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary for the efficient performance of the Commission's functions for the persons elected at subsequent rounds of zoned elections to be appointed as commissioners on a full time basis, the Minister shall appoint those persons as commissioners on a full time basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is not meant to allow him to pick and choose between particular persons and to show favouritism and partisan patronage, which I think is the basic fear lying behind Senator Peter Baume's amendment. For that reason I believe that his fears are somewhat unfounded. In fact, the Parliamentary Counsel has suggested that to make that absolutely clear, at page 17, clause 29, line 4, where it reads, `now the Minister shall appoint those persons', the word ``all'' be inserted after `appoint'. It would read, `The Minister shall appoint all those persons as Commissioners on a full-time basis'. I think that would do away with a lot of the fear of patronage and favouritism which Senator Baume has referred to. For that reason, I seek leave of the Committee to insert the word `all' after `appoint' in clause 29, page 17, line 4.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that response. In order that the Opposition can evaluate what the Minister has said, we really need to ask him a question. He said that the clause is drafted as a result of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander input. That input-the nature of the input, the time of that input-is quite unknown to the Opposition. We would like to get some details of the input to which the Minister was referring and on which he bases the justification for the clause. Perhaps he can get his officials to give him some information on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Minister for his response in relation to our concerns about selective patronage. We note what he said. But I return to our concern: we have envisaged the board of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) as being rather like the board of a large commercial corporation. Typically, members of the board work on a part time basis in that job. We still think that is the appropriate way in which ATSIC might be constructed. If we were unsuccessful in what we are seeking to do, of course, we would look favourably upon the amendment which the Minister has proposed. As our first position, we still believe that on the analogy we draw, say, with the Qantas Airways Ltd board, or the Reserve Bank of Australia board or any others, most of the members should be part time members. To use the Minister's own example, we believe this will give the possibility of a wider range of talents being available to ATSIC once it gets under way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advisers are not able to give me community by community examples over a period, but they tell me that this was a theme of the consultations which the Minister undertook from late 1987 onwards, particularly in central Australia. Those views were made known. What we are saying, basically, is that that sort of flexibility which Senator Baume seems to think is useful in relation to allowing the talents of part time members to be made available as elected commissioners is provided for within this clause. Part time members will be the norm. It is only if, after a period, the Minister comes to the view that it is not working as it should to perform its functions that there would be a move for all these persons elected at subsequent rounds to be elected on a full time basis. The consultations indicated that that was the wish of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is confirmed by my officials. In fact, I am informed, Senator Baume, that Shirley McPherson was first appointed on a part time basis and later made full time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, may I make a suggestion? I think we are all interested in getting as much done as possible. The Government does believe that it is important that we have the flexibility with the Chairperson that was demonstrated in the case of Shirley McPherson, as provided for in the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. If perchance the outstanding candidate could not otherwise be appointed because he or she could not take up a full time position, that would be a disaster. It is not ad hominem. I have no idea who is in mind, if anyone. But I believe we should keep that flexibility. As to subclause 4, to be quite frank it is not going to happen in the first two years. I do not want to argue any more. We should drop that subclause, and leave it for the two-year review. If the Commission wishes to make a case that it has been unable to perform its duties satisfactorily because of having only part time members, it can make a case at the end of the two-year review. So subclause 4 can be deleted. Let us get on with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (45) Page 17, subclause 30 (2), lines 29 to 32, leave out the subclause, insert the following subclauses:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Subject to subsection (3), a person is not qualified to be appointed as a Commissioner if he or she:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is an undischarged bankrupt;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law and sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law involving dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) In spite of subsection (2), a person covered by paragraph (2) (b) or (c) is not disqualified by that paragraph from being appointed as a Commissioner if:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) where the person did not serve a term of imprisonment for the offence-at least 5 years have elapsed since the person was convicted;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) where the person served a term of imprisonment for the offence-at least 5 years have elapsed since the person was released from prison; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in any case-the Federal Court of Australia, on application by the person, declares that in spite of the person's conviction, he or she ought not to be disqualified from being appointed as a Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) The Federal Court of Australia has jurisdiction with respect to matters arising under subsection (3).''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a long amendment and it relates to page 17 of the Bill where we seek to leave out clause 30 subclause (2) which appears at lines 29 to 32, with a view to inserting a new subclause. Subclause (2) of clause 30 states:</PARA>
<PARA>A person is not qualified to be appointed as a Commissioner if the person has been convicted and is under sentence for an offence punishable under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory by imprisonment for 5 years or longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Just let me say, in the simplest summing up, that this is altogether inadequate as a protection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from the kinds of persons who should be disqualified from being appointed as commissioner. Let us look at what it says. They are not qualified:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the person has been convicted and is under sentence for an offence punishable . . .  by imprisonment for five years or longer. </PARA>
<PARA>If it were a bad offence punishable by two years imprisonment, the person could still be appointed a commissioner. If a person was convicted but not under sentence, he could still be appointed a commissioner and so on. We think that is altogether too lenient. The 1988 Bill, now superseded by the present Bill, is useful here. The disqualifying provisions in that Bill were too lenient as well. That Bill, in fact, referred to disqualification for persons who were subject to imprisonment for one year or longer for an offence. The new Bill disqualifies a person who has been convicted and is under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for five or longer. The proposed amendment which the Opposition is putting up takes a slightly different approach. We propose to put in a new subsection (2) which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a person is not qualified to be appointed as a Commissioner if he or she-</PARA>
<PARA>we outline a number of conditions which are not unreasonable, and which I list here-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is an undischarged bankrupt . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If he is an undischarged bankrupt he should not be a commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Our amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law and sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law involving dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA>I will turn to that in one moment. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>(3) In spite of subsection (2), a person covered by paragraph 2 (b) or 2 (c) is not disqualified by that paragraph . . . if . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then there are some other conditions, because we do not want to make people ineligible for life. We do not want to be harsh in what we are proposing. We actually want to try to be reasonable and to promote the best interests of the Commission itself. So, if the person did not serve a term of imprisonment for the offence and at least five years have elapsed since the person was convicted, we say, `Wipe the slate clean' in terms of appointment as a commissioner. Or where the person did serve a term of imprisonment for the offence and at least five years have elapsed since the person was released from prison, we say, `Wipe the slate clean'. In any case the Federal Court of Australia on application by the person could declare that in spite of the person's conviction he or she ought not be disqualified from being appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have tried to provide an appeal procedure where someone says, `Look, this is not fair. I may have been convicted but in fact I should be capable of being appointed a commissioner'. Then that person could go to the Federal Court and argue his case. Our amendment actually seeks to put in better safeguards for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for whom the Commission is supposed to operate. It seeks to identify certain people who should not become commissioners but at the same time to provide mechanisms which will build fairness into the system and which will in fact wipe the slate clean after a period of five years. The Minister for Justice will know where we got the period of five years from. I think it relates to directors and trade union officials. There are similar provisions in other legislation relating to people who have been convicted, and whether they can then be appointed to certain positions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one matter I have not come back to and that is the question of a conviction for an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law involving dishonesty. In every community in which I have worked there are honest and dishonest people, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are no different. There are saints and sinners, there are good and bad people and there are some dishonest people. It is just not right if dishonest people are able to be elected as commissioners of ATSIC and to have control of or a significant say in the very onerous responsibilities which will attract to that position. We have proposed that the Minister would have the responsibility of declining to appoint as commissioner, a person who, in his opinion, had committed an offence of such seriousness and so recently that he was not a suitable person to have financial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was Minister we had, for example, evidence presented to us of blatant dishonesty involving the misappropriation of Commonwealth funds within an Aboriginal organisation but we could not get sufficient evidence actually to convict someone. We had many witnesses' statements, we had much information, we knew who had had the money, we knew who suddenly had the new motor cars and we knew what had happened even if we could not get a conviction. That is why we say that such people are not suitable. We have drawn the amendment more narrowly. We have used the words `is an undischarged bankrupt; has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law and sentenced to imprisonment for one year of longer; or has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law involving dishonesty'. We are saying any conviction for dishonesty should disqualify someone for five years from occupying a position of trust such as would be involved in becoming a commissioner of ATSIC. As I said to the Committee, Mr Temporary Chairman, we have written in a series of protections to make sure that people will not be unfairly treated by this provision. I have to say to you that we have drawn upon laws which exist in other areas of Commonwealth responsibility to try to model the way in which we might respond here. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that there is no party partisan politics in what we are suggesting here. It relates only to the type of people who might be commissioners for ATSIC and it relates to the kinds of disqualifications which are necessary and advisable. I remind the Committee that one of the people who argued most vociferously for ATSIC before the Select Committee is now in prison for a serious offence. People do go to prison and it is not appropriate that those people should become elected commissioners. Of course they would not become appointed commissioners because, we hope, the Minister would take such appointments to a Cabinet Committee and they would be appropriately vetted at that level. But we think it is necessary to be rather more realistic and comprehensive in the way in which clause 30 is drawn and we believe our amendment will be to the advantage of the Commission and lead to the protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, what Senator Baume is proposing, as I listen to him, is that somehow this Parliament should set itself up as an extra sentencing tribunal to add to the punishment to be awarded by the community to those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who find themselves properly convicted of an offence, for example an offence involving dishonesty. The sentencing magistrate or judge hears the case, knows all the facts, has all the pre-sentence reports before him or her and decides to award a non-custodial sentence. Perhaps it is a social security offence involving fraud of such a nature that does not warrant a gaol sentence, perhaps a stealing offence of some kind, some minor property matter. The magistrate or judge decides that a term of imprisonment is not at all a proper response by the community in relation to that offence and perhaps puts the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person on a community service order, if that is available in the jurisdiction, or does not even impose a fine but simply records a conviction. Senator Baume says that that person should be excluded from the possibility of being appointed as a commissioner for some five years unless he or she can go through the delay and expense of going to the Federal Court to plead some special case.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that that is to put so many extra burdens on a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent in relation to the possibility of appointment as not to be able to be countenanced and also throws up a huge hurdle in front of such a person if somehow he is to extricate himself from the prima facie position which Senator Baume's amendment would put him in. He would have to go to the Federal Court. I do not know how many thousands of dollars he might be up for in mounting a plea to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia if he loses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems an extraordinary situation that we do not allow the ordinary and fully public scrutiny that will occur in relation to such appointments to enable a satisfactory appointment to be made and for proper account to be taken in the appointment process of the prior convictions a person might have in what is by definition a past phase of that person's life. I am sure it would be taken into account, but I think it should be weighed properly. Of course, the Minister would be absolutely answerable to the Parliament if he made an appointment which was quite clearly unacceptable, given the nature of the offence of dishonesty for which the person was convicted. I think to have a broad brush approach like this where the Parliament becomes an extra sentencing tribunal is not justified. </PARA>

We actually have a duty here, a duty to lay down proper provisions in this legislation in order that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission can work properly and the people who are represented by ATSIC can be protected. If we look at that provision, it is possible at the moment, as that provision is written, for an undischarged bankrupt to be appointed as a commissioner. Nothing in that provision would stop the appointment of a person who is an undischarged bankrupt, who has taken advantage of bankruptcy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, it might just help Senator Coulter if I did explain why the amendment which would make an undischarged bankrupt ineligible to be appointed as a commissioner is not acceptable to the Government. It may be true that our Constitution, drafted at the turn of the century, does not permit such a person to serve, but I was a member of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which reported in 1980, or maybe 1981, on the constitutional qualifications of members of parliament. In looking at the question of bankruptcy and insolvency it had this to say, having dealt with some other arguments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We are more influenced by the current attitudes towards bankrupt and insolvent persons; such persons are not, in our view, tainted as morally reprehensible or delinquent, nor are they prima facie unsuitable as a candidate or member of Parliament. The continuing expansion of credit facilities and the increasing uncertainties of economic conditions make these provisions inappropriate as a disqualification. We have no hesitation in leaving such a decision to the electors as we have already indicated as a basis for our recommendation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe there we have a Senate committee-and I believe it is the unanimous view of the senators who then composed the committee, the late Senator Alan Missen, the distinguished Chairman; Senator Gareth Evans; Senator David Hamer; Senator Christopher Puplick; Senator Michael Tate; and Senator John Wheeldon, who was then a member of the Senate-which came to that particular point of view. I hope in pointing to that that I am not being accused of falling for the argument that we are creating a black Parliament. I am simply indicating that in relation to the question of bankruptcy disqualifying a person from holding a particular office, the view of the Senate Committee was that if we had an opportunity to amend the Constitution that should not any longer be a bar for the Federal Parliament and the matter could safely be left to the electors. I am saying that this matter of bankruptcy can safely be left to the good judgment of the Minister. If he gets it wrong he is answerable to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for those remarks because he was corroborating, with the aid of a Senate report, very much the sentiments that I am going to express. It seems to me that there are very many people in our society who become bankrupt who are upright, honest and worthy citizens, and who become bankrupt for no cause for which they are directly responsible; they become bankrupt due to circumstances beyond their control. The condition of bankruptcy, therefore, does not necessarily in any sense reflect upon their honesty and integrity and their ability to perform a satisfactory function in relation to the ATSIC. I will come back to that in dealing with the Opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, having said that, it seems to me that the Opposition has a point in relation to indicating to the Minister, who, after all, will make these appointments-and remember, we are looking at only three people, out of a population of 300,000 Aboriginal people, who have to be selected-that it is appropriate that the Parliament should indicate to the Minister that the Parliament would expect the Minister to observe very high standards with respect to those appointments. I take it that what the Opposition is doing here is really giving an indicative list. These are the sorts of things which, in the view of the Parliament, would rule a person as being an unsuitable person for such an appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the words of the clause itself, I have always had difficulty with the words-and I think Senator Baume will remember that I expressed some difficulty with these words when we were sitting on the Senate Committee-`A person is not qualified to be appointed as a Commissioner if the person has been convicted and is under sentence for an offence . . .'. In other words, both conditions have to be satisfied: the person has to have been convicted and be under sentence; which means that the person has been convicted and is either awaiting imprisonment or is already in gaol-that is the way I read those words-and has been sentenced to gaol for five years or longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I am misinterpreting the words. Perhaps I may explain my understanding of the words and then the Minister may like to correct me. As I read the words, `has been convicted' seems to me to be quite clear; a person has committed an offence and has gone through a court process and been convicted. That person is `under sentence for an offence'; presumably the offence is the offence for which he has been convicted; and the person is `under sentence' for that offence and that offence is `punishable under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State . . . by imprisonment for 5 years or longer'. It might be true that they are not actually put into gaol for five years; the person might be gaoled for only two years. But in the law the offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment for five years of longer. It seems to me that both conditions must be satisfied so that immediately after that person comes out of gaol under those conditions, then the person would be eligible to be appointed. If I am wrong in that interpretation I would certainly appreciate the advice of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

But in relation to the correct interpretation of clause 30, subsection (2), what one has to look for, of course, is in the criminal code of the State or the Commonwealth statute for the possibility of the offence being punished by a term of imprisonment of five years or longer. It may well be that the person is awarded a community service order rather than being sent to gaol, in which case during the currency of the community service order that person would be under sentence and therefore not qualified to be appointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us say somebody was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of, to put it in ordinary terms, six months minimum, two years maximum. If, after six months, the person is released from gaol, for the balance of the two years he is under parole supervision, as he is still under the sentence of the court. During that period of parole, to the end of the maximum period of the sentence-the head sentence-the person would not be eligible to be appointed as a commissioner. Whilst that sentence is actually in effect the person is disqualified; it does not require that the person actually be languishing in prison. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the Minister because he has made it clear to Senator Coulter and to me that it refers to all 20 commissioners. I understand now when I read it that that is the case. As the clause is written, someone who is actually in prison for social security fraud, for not accounting for the expenditure of Commonwealth moneys-for something, say, associated with Boomanulla Oval or something like that-could actually be elected as a commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) while he is in his prison cell, because if the offence was one which carried only a two-year maximum gaol sentence, he is not picked up by this provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept what Senator Coulter has said: there is a difference in quality between the question of bankruptcy and the question of dishonesty. Since it relates to all 20 commissioners it makes the question even more acute. This Committee is considering the circumstances under which people can be appointed to what will be a giant commercial undertaking. By any measurement ATSIC will be a giant undertaking. We are talking about the qualities of those persons who may be appointed as commissioners. There will be only 20 commissioners. We are saying that certain people should not be so appointed. I believe that the position of commissioner will carry with it some major fiduciary obligations; I think every member of the Committee would agree with that. The question is: What is the proper course for us to take to try to exclude properly those people who, by their conduct, are not suitable to undertake such a fiduciary role? The Government has already conceded that it wants to go down that track although it has only put one toe in the water. It says that if people are convicted and are under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or longer, they should not be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Coulter and my colleagues that the disqualifying provision in the 1988 Bill was different. It merely talked about imprisonment of one year or longer for an offence. In a way, that might have picked up more people, but we are saying that the proper way to go about it is to set out a series of offences which make a person unsuitable. We have deliberately included proposed subclause (2)(c) which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law involving dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA>We have included that because we are concerned about this question of trust; we are concerned about this question of probity of the commissioners. If we wish ATSIC to succeed, if, in this committee stage we are trying to consider clauses which will allow ATSIC to operate optimally, this subclause that is under consideration becomes very critical. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Minister seen a report in this morning's Australian Financial Review that Australia has the fourth lowest tax regime in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)? What do these statistics reveal about the accuracy of the welfare state tag put on Australia by some conservative commentators and political figures?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report and last week I also received a table, from Treasury I think. I am not sure from which publication it was drawn. The table shows the same thing as the Australian Financial Review report reveals, so I presume the source is common. That is, taking total taxation as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), Australia stands at 31.3 per cent, and at the top of the table we have countries such as Sweden on almost 57 per cent, Denmark on 52 per cent, and virtually all of Western Europe falling somewhere between. Indeed, the only countries in the OECD that have a lower level of taxation as a proportion of GDP are Japan and the United States. In those two cases they are only marginally lower at just over 30 per cent. Turkey is right down the bottom at 24 per cent of GDP for total taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question referred to a welfare state. Perceptions of what a welfare state is are somewhat variable. In the case of Australia, we do have what would be generally regarded as a welfare state but is very much a targeted welfare state. That is largely responsible for the differences in the levels of taxation applying in Australia and in most of northern and Western Europe, although there are some variations in the composition between those countries. In Australia, for example, in the short term, unemployment benefit payments are relatively low compared to a number of European countries but over the long term they are more adequate than the levels prevailing in those same European countries. Japan and Turkey rely less on governments for welfare payments than does Australia or, indeed, probably any other country in the OECD. In the United States there is a much lower level of public expenditure on health. In the United States only about 40 per cent of total health expenditure is publicly financed. In Australia the percentage is almost 85 per cent. But the United States-and this is a very important point-has a very much higher total level of health expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic produce (GDP) than does Australia. Indeed, it is some 3 percentage points higher. This demonstrates, I believe, that both our public health and welfare sectors are efficient by world standards in delivering equitable outcomes relative to the level of taxation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> There are from time to time demands from both sides. On the one side there are people who believe that the number of free or subsidised services that are available should be increased or their quality, and therefore their cost, improved. They believe that the welfare system ought to be less targeted than it is and/or pay higher rates. That, of course, can be responsibly accomplished only if there is a commensurate increase in the level of taxation and, as I pointed out last week publicly, the most effective resistance to higher levels of taxation comes from the work force in general which pays most of the taxation. That resistance is expressed through the Australian Council of Trade Unions among other sources. On the other hand, we have people who claim that the welfare system should be more tightly targeted than it is. That is a point of view. But, in view of the commitment which I am told Senator Stone gave to the National Press Club today that a coalition government would not be cutting pensions, I am wondering which elements of this mythical Australian welfare state the Opposition is proposing to cut should it be elected to government. As soon as that promised list is revealed-I think it is supposed to come at the end of this month or something like that-I will be studying it with great interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate follows his rather extraordinary explanation of what Sir Peter Abeles apparently meant by his broadcast.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, this is a serious issue, despite the rumblings on the other side. People are becoming much more environmentally conscious. Not only are they prepared to make decisions responsive to the environment for themselves, but also they expect governments to intervene to protect the quality of life. That is one of the principles guiding this Government. This area is one which has been given up to us as an example of where governments can intervene to assist people making informed choices. Not only has this come to us from consumers but also we have noticed in recent months a growing number of industry organisations responding and putting out programs in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe the Government has a role to ensure that consumers are not misled about what products may be environmentally sound and also that industry has a nationally uniform framework in which to act and in which to coordinate its proposals. As I say, this consideration, this concern, in the community has been acknowledged by the Government. In recent months we have had some discussions with consumer groups and conservationist groups. Also, representations have been put both to me and to Senator Richardson by industry groups. We announced a little while ago that we would give attention to how we could respond to the area. Today both Senator Richardson and I will be announcing and setting up a national inquiry into the marketing and promotion of evironmentally friendly products. The inquiry is to look at all parts of the development of the process, including production. It will also look at different ways in which we can respond, whether it is by, for instance, endorsing specific products, specific qualities in products, or generic ranges of products. The alternative of an education promotion campaign better to assist both industry and consumers is also going to be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry will be run by representatives from both my Department and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and in its considerations will be consulting with States, industry and public interest groups. It will also have a charter to look at what is happening internationally, and at what groups industry is putting up within Australia, as well as the conservation movement. We expect that the first report, a general summary of what is happening internationally and nationally, will come to us by early October. We anticipate a final report early next year.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as I said, the inquiry will be set up this afternoon. The Government is concerned to ensure that people who are concerned about making environmentally conscious decisions and buying environmentally friendly products will not be misled; that they will have the information that should be available to them. We are also concerned that industry act within a coordinated, uniform framework.</PARA>

Thirdly, has the Minister been informed of the plight of Mr Brian Kirk, aged 33 and the father of two children, and of Mr John Walshaw, aged 67, both of whom in the absence of any alternative treatment for mesothelioma are to undergo surgery to cut all the nerves surrounding their spine and lungs which will both relieve their unendurable pain and cripple them? Fourthly, will the Minister undertake to approve further funding to the program without delay?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take those questions in the order in which they were asked. To the first question I can say that I am advised that the National Health and Medical Research Council has not reported on funding proposals for 1990. Recommendations are not expected before October of this year. To the second question I can say that funding for the research being conducted by Dr Robinson and Dr Musk will continue until 31 December 1989 when their current three-year project funding expires. The project is funded as research, not as treatment programs. The provision of appropriate health care services in Western Australia is a matter for the Western Australian Government in that sense. To the third question, the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, is not aware of cases raised by Senator Jenkins. Treatment arrangements are not the responsibility of the Minister. They are matters for the patient and the treating clinician. As already pointed out, overall responsibility for health services in Western Australia is a matter for the Western Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the last question asked by Senator Jenkins, the Minister will approve funding for further research by Dr Robinson and Dr Musk beyond 31 December 1989 only if the National Health and Medical Research Council advises that their proposed research has sufficient scientific merit to attract funding in competition with other applications.</PARA>

On 26 May the Minister said exactly the same thing, that the research will be approved if the National Health and Medical Research Council recommends that continued research warranted the further funding. I therefore ask the Minister whether he is aware that at least one top level researcher has already left that team of researchers, because if members are kept on edge until the end of the year obviously they cannot be kept on tap and only be given a few weeks' notice as to whether or not their research qualities will be needed for next year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me answer the question as it has been put. I say thank you to Senator Jenkins for acknowledging consistency, at least, in terms of the answers of 26 May and today. Secondly, I will certainly draw her remarks to the attention of Dr Blewett. Thirdly, if it is true that one top level researcher has already left I again observe that funding is in place to carry through on the projects that have been approved until the end of this year. In October of this year the National Health and Medical Research Council will report on funding proposals for next year. Therefore, if that researcher has left on the basis of uncertainty about funding, and for no other reason-I am not sure whether there are other reasons-then I would have to say that that is a premature decision and that that researcher would be better advised to continue on until the funding position is determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that these funding decisions are made by the National Health and Medical Research Council and then recommended to the Minister. I am not quite sure whether the Minister actually has discretion in approving them or in fact he is bound to accept them. But leaving that point aside, one has to say that the best qualified minds in Australia to make a medical assessment of the need and veracity of this research in competition with other projects is being applied in this case and we should await their outcome and not make premature or startling claims before the process has been completed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. With regard to the Government's commitment to micro-economic reform, has the Government monitored the benefits that have accrued to the petroleum industry since the deregulation of the crude oil market on 1 January 1988?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1062" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Government has maintained a monitoring of the effects of the deregulation of crude oil marketing in Australia. I should mention to the Senate that this was a policy brought in by the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, and that we have monitored the effects of it by looking at the activities on the ground, by holding discussions with the various companies, by examining the comments made by those companies at shareholder meetings and in their annual reports and by examining the comments made by industry observers. I think sufficient time has now elapsed since 1 January 1988 to enable a summary or conclusions to be made about the effects of that deregulation, and I should point out that one of the key expectations of the deregulation would be that it would bring forth a considerable improvement in the refining capacity within Australia for various types of crude oil including oil from outside of this country as well as oil from within it. That was regarded as one of the benchmarks for whether or not this deregulation would be successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, the oil companies and the observers all report that they believe that the deregulation has been successful and one of the ways in which we can establish that beyond doubt is to look at what investments they have now made in extra plant and equipment. BP Australia Ltd has now announced the commissioning of a residue cracking unit at Kwinana to process heavier crudes. Those crudes classically are crudes that might be purchased from the People's Republic of China and elsewhere. Ampol Ltd has announced a $100m investment for the construction of a platinum catalyst reformer at the Lytton refinery to produce high octane feed stock for unleaded petrol. Shell Australia Ltd has announced a $400m investment in a catalytic cracking unit at Geelong and a $200m investment in extending and upgrading the Clyde refinery. Caltex Australia Ltd has announced a $57m investment in the rationalisation of the Kurnell refinery, with improvements in control instrumentation and conversion units being modified to take heavier crudes with improved product yields. We have now seen a massive investment in the refining capacity in Australia which I believe can be routed back to the deregulation decision. Indeed, observations of that character are made in the annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA> The other reason this investment has been forthcoming is that if one examines all of the annual reports of the oil companies in Australia for 1988 one can see that while some of them lost money in areas of their operations, only two of them had an actual loss and all of them made a substantial profit over 1987 in their refining and crude oil divisions. I think that is also a feature of deregulation. We have here a stunning record of micro-economic reform achieved by the Hawke Government, and making a move to deregulation has massively increased investment in refining capacity in Australia and is a shining example of the commitment of this Government to continuing through micro-economic reform to achieve efficiencies in the industrial infrastructure of this country.</PARA>

<PARA> I recall that the costs over the long term of that disastrous contract were in excess of $1 billion. I also remember ringing, shortly after the Federal election of 1983, the relevant Minister in the Western Australian government of the day and suggesting to him that he sack the State Electricity Commission (SEC) commissioners who had signed that contract, that he call them up and asked why they had signed that contract. If they said, `Well, we signed that because we thought it was good business', they should have been sacked for incompetence. If they were to say, `We signed it because Charlie Court was twisting our arms', which is the real reason they signed it, they should have been sacked for being toadies of Charlie Court. I still believe that that was a bit of good advice, which unfortunately the Western Australian Government did not act upon. As a consequence of that omission, the State Government was lumbered with a $1 billion-plus bill, because of this contract, which a megalomaniac who happened to be Premier at the time, back in the late 1970s, had forced the State Electricity Commission commissioners to sign.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article. I have not read it thoroughly. I have glanced through it briefly. It is the work of two researchers with the Institute of Family Studies whose names, I think, are Frank Maas and Peter McDonald. The article reached the following three broad conclusions: Firstly, income splitting helps the wrong families, `wrong' being defined as those who are not particularly needy. Secondly, and fairly obviously to anybody who is at all numerate, it would be extremely costly unless of course the tax rate scales were to be changed and the tax rates significantly increased. Thirdly, it would discourage married women from working in the paid work force or preparing themselves to enter the paid work force. I have not checked the precise figuring that is reported in the article but I can confirm that the three broad conclusions are soundly based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Income splitting of the type discussed in this article is similar, as I understand it, to income splitting proposals which emerge in the Opposition from time to time and get regularly bucketed by Senator Vanstone, among others. In particular, I understand Senator Vanstone on the Keith Conlon show in Adelaide on 22 August very effectively bucketed the idea that her leader was touting at that time. Apparently he had thought through his position on income splitting about as thoroughly as he had thought through his position on the taxation of nominal or real interest rates. Both I suppose spring from the common denominator-that, as he admits, he does not take an accountant's approach to Budget preparation. But income splitting of the type discussed in the article could lead to a significant number of low income families paying more tax while families with a single income earner on $70,000 or more could pay less. In the words of the authors:</PARA>
<PARA>If the introduction of income splitting were to be cost neutral (that is, that no government revenues would be lost) major cuts to other government programs such as health, education and welfare would be necessary. Families on the lowest incomes would be hit hardest by these across-the-board cuts, regardless of whether they were receiving one or two incomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the table in question. Foreign debt or the seriousness of a foreign debt burden can, of course, be interpreted in a number of different ways, all of them having an element of legitimacy in them-for example, debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), the cost of servicing debt as a proportion of export income and so on. Those various measures all have some relevance in demonstrating the underlying reality. But basically, without going into the detail or endorsing the particular interpretation that may have been put on that table, the basic question that I have been asked is: Do I regard Australia's debt problem as serious? My guess is that I have made at least a dozen speeches in the last 12 months in which I have answered that question in advance. Of course I regard it as serious. I regard as equally serious the fact that we continue to run a large current account deficit, largely, of course, because of the cost of servicing the existing debt. There can be short term variations in measures of debt as a proportion of GDP caused by valuation changes which may or may not tell us very much that is meaningful about the underlying or the fundamental position. But of course I am concerned about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are ways of eliminating current account deficits. In New Zealand's case, for example, the current account deficit either has been eliminated or is very close to being eliminated. That, however, was done in conjunction with an increase in unemployment of around 5 percentage points, without even counting what was exported to Australia-that is, the unemployment that was exported to Australia. That is one way of overcoming a current account deficit. It is not, in my view or the Government's view, the best way of overcoming a current account deficit. That is essentially the way Australia overcame the same sort of problem in the 1930s and, I suppose, likewise in the 1890s, although there are few, if any, reliable statistics available for the 1890s period. It is one way of overcoming it. It is not the optimum way, and it is not the way in which either the Government or I would like to see it done.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or both, because even after she was put straight last week, as Senator Crowley says, she repeated the same drivel two days ago in the Senate. What she either fails to understand or refuses to recognise is that the Government has changed the timing of the taxation of funded superannuation schemes and payments in such a way that some of the tax is paid when the money goes into the fund with a more than commensurate reduction-I will return to that in a moment-in the amount of tax which is paid on the way out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The change has no negative effect in leaving all superannuants-as Senator Walters says-down by that particular amount. It just means that a slightly lesser amount of tax is paid at different times, some of it up front and some of it further down the track, without any detriment to the ultimate payments to be realised by the individuals. It applies to funded schemes only and because a tax of 15 per cent is applied on the way in, the two taxation rates which previously applied to lump sum payments on the way out of 15 per cent and 30 per cent have been reduced to zero and 15 per cent. The reason that the total amount of tax paid falls marginally is that what is now the 15 per cent tax levied when a lump sum is taken out of a fund is levied on an 85 per cent base whereas previously it would have been levied on a 100 per cent base. I know that Senator Watson understands the arithmetic underlying that and since Senator Walters sits alongside him I suggest that she try to arrange for Senator Watson to give her a tutorial on this, preferably using large numerals and multi-coloured pencils to attract her attention.</PARA>

I do not believe in communicating through the press, so I do not necessarily accept that Mr Shack made all those remarks in the particular way in which the report I saw indicated. However, there are allegations of this sort abroad. Let me deal with them. I regard those allegations that the Tribunal was not genuinely independent as nothing short of a foul smear of the Tribunal. The National Health Act, amended during the period of the Fraser Government when Mr MacKellar was Minister for Health, requires that the Tribunal be independent. The Act was observed in this case by the Government, in the full sense of the word. Therefore, if there are allegations emanating from Opposition health spokespeople then they are against an Act which is a Liberal Party Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

I regard, therefore, that innuendo against him and the other two independent members of the Tribunal as nothing short of slanderous. This has brought up what I think is a flaw in the legislation, in that there are not contempt provisions for people who make slanderous remarks about three individuals who hold a judicial appointment. If there were contempt proceedings under the Act and those people could be identified, the Tribunal would be able to deal with a contempt of its members in an appropriate way. I think that that is a gap in the Act. The second allegation concerns the database. I know that Mr Shack has said that the database is flawed, but he has not said where it is flawed or how it is flawed, nor has he adduced any proof, presented any evidence to support his assertion, or said by whom it is regarded as flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Seven government departments were involved in the preparation of the Government's submission to the Tribunal. All of them accepted that the database was valid, that the database was compiled on methodology recommended by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and that it conformed to that methodology; it is a database approved, therefore, by the ABS. I do not know that anyone wishes to sully the reputation of that organisation. The three independent members of the Tribunal also accept that the database is accurate. Therefore, arguments by assertions which are meant to shake the confidence in an objectively prepared database can only be seen as political manoeuvring and since no evidence has been adduced or presented to establish the allegations, as frankly a fairly shameful political act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reply to the question by saying that any ex-serviceman who took part in the British atomic tests program in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s and who has an illness or disease which it is considered results from participation in that program, has always been entitled to apply for compensation under the Commonwealth compensation legislation. Honourable senators might recall that in 1986, in response to a recommendation of the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia between 1952 and 1963, the Government extended compensation eligibility to non-Commonwealth employees, pastoralists and Aborigines who were on the test site and, as a consequence, compensation is available to any of the 15,400 people involved in the atomic test program. In regard to the round figure of 15,400, it is not possible to give a precise figure for the reason that there is no record of the actual number of Aborigines in the area. Therefore we have to make an approximation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, as announced on Monday, the Government has now decided to set up a special administrative scheme to compensate any test participant who has, or has died from, multiple myeloma or leukaemia other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia. The decision is based on maintaining equity between Australian and British atomic test personnel following action taken last year by the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Security to pay a war pension to any UK test participant with either of those two diseases. I point out that this recent decision applies only to the conditions of multiple myeloma and leukaemia other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia. It does not change the situation regarding other medical conditions. In these cases the individuals would still need to put in a claim for compensation to Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean asked for some particular details. In terms of the first part of his question, I have given him the figure of 15,400 and the reason why we say that is an approximate figure. In terms of the second part of his question he asked, referring to the 12 personnel, `Are they expected to be the only ones eligible?'. We only know of 12 people who have the two conditions that qualify in this case for special arrangements, but if any others come forward they too, if they meet the criteria, will be eligible. I also emphasise that if there are any other conditions-individuals may not qualify for this compensation, but nonetheless they may have a claim-that claim can go before Comcare and be dealt with. Senator McLean also asked-I think I have answered it-this third question: Do they have to have the two specific ailments to be eligible? He asked: How many families of the 60 or so personnel who are known to have already died from cancer subsequent to their involvement will be eligible? I do not know where the figure of 60 comes from. I cannot verify the figure of 60, but of course anyone who comes forward will be eligible if they meet the criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I confirm Senator McLean's observations about Doug Rickard but say that he has already been paid compensation for these conditions. He came forward several years ago. He proved that he has the condition and that he was present at the tests. His claim was accepted and he was awarded compensation. What is now being made available is the same conditions to others at the same level. Therefore, to provide him with a particular claim in this case would be to provide him with a doubling up, and that is not appropriate in the circumstances.</PARA>

This is a compensation scheme for a set of circumstances which, I think, has been canvassed adequately in the Royal Commission. It is not a set of circumstances that can be laid at the door of this Government.

<PARA> On 1 June the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, announced the Government's response to the Inter-State Commission report concerning the waterfront.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For as long as it has been around, the Australian Labor Party has had a chronic inability to distinguish between its own coffers and public revenues; between its treasury and the public treasury; between its purse and the public purse. Whenever it goes to put its hands in its pockets for electoral expenses, somehow, mysteriously, but unerringly, it manages to put that hand into the pockets of the Australian taxpayers instead. With the advent of its latest $3.2m theft of public money from the taxpayers by way of a stamp allowance to members of the House of Representatives, by way of that rort it has hit new heights of public contempt for probity and new depths of political immorality. This is but the last and the latest in a long, tawdry, sordid but systematic campaign to transfer the costs of its election campaigns from its own coffers to the public purse, thereby plundering the pockets of the Australian taxpayer yet further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not content with being the highest taxing, most grasping government in Australia's history, it now reveals itself as the greatest thief of public money for its own political purposes. There has been a whole series of these particular undertakings. Let me simply list some of them: the system of public funding; the proposals for free media advertising; the postage allowance; the variety of government propaganda glossies; the National Media Liaison Service (NMLS) operation; the deliberate cuts imposed in the budget of the Senate, where it can be at least held to scrutiny; the unlimited provision of certain resources to the House of Representatives members only; the public payment of telemarketing campaigns of members of the House of Representatives; the secret public opinion polls paid for out of public funds; the price watch exercise. We will come to each of those in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the magnitude of that amount. In terms of public funding, on the last occasion the Labor Party was paid $4.8m out of public revenues. On Government television advertising of Labor Party schemes, there was expenditure of at least $8m, going up in some instances perhaps to as high as $10m. On replacing its own advertising on television with a system whereby other people will have to pay for television advertising, it could cost at least another $5.5m. The stamp allowance paid to members of the Australian Labor Party is worth $2.6m; the price watch exercise, a quarter of a million dollars; and the covert subsidies to members of the House of Representatives of another $1m; giving in total a figure of between $23m and $26m worth of public expenditure on campaign expenses which ought properly to have been borne by the Australian Labor Party and the members of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come first to that question of public funding. In 1983 public funding was introduced by the Labor Party into the electoral system with the connivance of the Australian Democrats and in the face of the opposition of the Liberal and National parties, which moved as an amendment to that Bill that the section of the Bill regarding public funding should be deleted because we do not believe and never have believed that paying money out of the public exchequer for that particular purpose is in fact the correct way to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray interjects. Let me make it perfectly clear to him: despite the fact that the system has been rorted by the Labor Party, we are not going to stand back and allow it to double its advantage in that regard because we have said consistently that when we are returned to government public funding will be removed. It will be removed and we will see whether the Democrats, or what is left of them after the next election, are prepared to be part of that particular arrangement. At the last election campaign $4.759m of public money was, according to the Electoral Commission, paid to the Labor Party-money which could have been paid to do something about the sorts of promises made in that last election campaign. Do you remember them, Mr Deputy President? No child will be living in poverty by 1990. That is the sort of promise the Labor Party will be prepared to dishonour, while keeping its own snouts in the public trough for $4.8m worth of public money in public funding terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We come next to the question of the proposals put forward again by a Labor-Democrat majority of the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to replace the cost of advertising on television with subsidies out of the public purse once again. If we look at the last report of the Joint Committee we see that in the 1987 election somewhere in excess of $10.25m was spent by the political parties on advertising, of which there was something like $7m spent in terms of television advertising. The Labor Party's share of that will be transferred to somebody else to pay for, and at the end of the day, of course, it will be out of the public purse. If we look at the article by Ross Dunn in the Australian Financial Review of 8 August, it talks about the way in which at the next election campaign that cost may be $15m but that will be transferred elsewhere. Dunn says:</PARA>
<PARA>But in order to save these millions, the major parties will have to agree to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They will have to agree to something and the only people who will save money will be the political parties. The Sydney Morning Herald in its editorial of 9 August, said this:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is to be assistance for political parties to advertise on television, there would be an honest and a dishonest way of providing it. Our politicians-</PARA>
<PARA>and I interpolate here, the Labor Party-Democrat majority of politicians on the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>having little difficulty with the question of whether their parties should get public assistance, are, typically, proposing to go about it the dishonest way.</PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>It is dishonest to pretend that $15 million worth of television time has no cost simply because it is appropriated rather than bought. </PARA>
<PARA>If the politicians had been honest-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate again, if the Labor Party and Democrat politicians had been honest-</PARA>
<PARA>they would have found $15 million from the public purse to distribute to the political parties so that they could buy the commercial television advertising time they say has become beyond their means. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA> The dishonest suggestion that compulsory advertisements will cost no-one anything helps avoid inconvenient questions about just how far public assistance to political parties should go. </PARA>
<PARA>It has nothing to do with improving the quality of democracy in this country. It has nothing to do with fundamental standards of probity and decency in public life. It has everything to do with saving the Labor Party money. </PARA>
<PARA> We come next to the question of stamp allowances. My colleague Senator Vanstone will have more to say about this matter. We must remember what the shabby deal is. The shabby deal is to bypass the Parliament, to bypass the proper legislative steps that need to be taken in this regard, to bypass the Remuneration Tribunal. I do not know how Senator Cook or anybody else can come in here and talk about the decisions of the umpire as far as pharmacies are concerned, because as soon as the Labor Party sees a potential advantage to it, it is prepared to take the matter out of the hands of the tribunal in order to put it in the pockets of members of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> We come next to the question of glossy advertising. The Department of Social Security-the Department which has presided over a decline in the real standard of living of Australian pensioners, of dependants, of children-embarked on an advertising campaign on family allowances, featuring pictures of a $20 note being handed over to buy new shoes for children; a campaign costing about $5m. The Age Pensioners News-sent out to everybody to try to persuade them that they were better off, when everybody who read it knew they were manifestly worse off-cost about $1m. The Australian Taxation Office's campaign used the marvellous heading, `We're here to help you'. After all of the bad press it has received, the truth is, as everybody knows, the only help that the Australian Taxation Office provides at the moment is to help to put the Labor Party's hands in the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia at every conceivable opportunity. That campaign cost $750,000. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the environment and multicultural advertising? According to the Government, it was the greatest statement ever issued as far as the environment is concerned, except in the minds of everybody who knows anything about the environment. I wrote to Senator Richardson and asked him how much it cost. He wrote back to me and said he did not know and that I should write to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and ask him. The last one to which I refer is the Australian Sports Kit-a lovely glossy kit. It includes a little picture of Senator Richardson. If one looks at his face, resting upon his hands, smiling into the camera, one would never have thought he would have capped a knee or kicked a head in his life. If he thinks that portraying himself like some superannuated koala bear on the front of such a kit means that he will get away with anything, he has another think coming. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of these sorts of glossies is now more than $10m. The Federal Labor Government is the third largest advertising buyer in Australia. It spends more than $35m on its advertising campaigns. Remember the $4m spent on Priority One? Remember the $6.5m spent on the tax file number? Remember the $4m that was spent before that on the identity card? Remember the $3m that was spent on a one-sided advertising campaign on the 1988 referendum, despite the fact that the Parliament said the Government should not do that? It should be remembered where it goes. It goes to Mojo MDA, its mates in the advertising industry, which received somewhere in the vicinity of $10m of that money. Some $300,000 goes to John Singleton Advertising. About $3m goes to Forbes Macfie Hansen. One thing one can say about the Labor Party is that when it is stealing money out of the public pocket it likes to make sure that its mates get a percentage on the way through. They are perfectly happy with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to the National Media Liaison Service. We do not know exactly what it is going to cost this year, because in the explanatory memorandum of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories for its estimates this year we find that there is only some of it in there. Then we get this quaint little line, `In addition, the administrative costs of the National Media Liaison Service are met from within this subprogram. Salaries and allowances for the NMLS are met by the Department of Administrative Services'. If we go to the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services, those figures are all buried in the rest of its salary components. So we cannot work out exactly what the cost is. In fact, if we look at the answers given to Senate Estimates Committee E, to Senate Estimates Committee D and by Senator Button in the chamber on 15 August 1989, we are given three quite different figures. But they are all between $1.2m and $1.5m. The figure was $1.5m when the National Times in August 1983 exposed what was going on. An article in the Adelaide News on 23 September 1988, in relation to Mr Colin Parks, the head of NMLS, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> He works in Parliament House and is paid by the Hawke Government with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> His brief is to chip away at the Opposition . . . The Hawke Government's use of the NMLS is a disgrace, providing it with an unfair advantage at no cost to party funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party does not have a free rein here in the Senate. When we put up, through the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, a request for proper funding, Senator Walsh, with the sort of attitude that he takes to the Senate, cuts it back by $1.765m despite the fact that he can find twice as much as that for the stamp allowances of members of the House of Representatives where the Labor Party does have a numerical advantage. Again, he does not want the Party's programs and behaviour put under scrutiny. In the House of Representatives this Government provides unlimited stationery so that members of that House, predominantly Labor members, can print their political newsletters for distribution to their constituents at public expense. They do that on their House of Representatives unlimited stationery and now postage. The Labor Party provides, through its telemarketing advice and from the software it has got from the United States, the programs for its members to telemarket and poll their electorates. The Department of Administrative Services pays the cost of those telephone calls. The Party runs an operation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in the least bit interested to hear interjections from somebody whose political career in Sussex Street was born, nurtured and promoted by the most corrupt political machine and organisation ever known in the history of this country. When he can come clean he can come in here and make comments. What have we found with things such as the Price Watch Committee? A number of selected Labor members are provided with additional staff and additional computer equipment. They put advertisements in the papers, with their photographs attached to them-the way that Mr Snowdon, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, does. The cost of that extra facility, extra staff, extra advertising and extra computers for Labor Party members-exclusively Labor Party members-is somewhere in the vicinity of another quarter of a million dollars. Finally, there are public opinion research operations, mainly undertaken through Australian National Opinion Polls and through Mr Cameron, which governments of Labor Party persuasions have been prepared to indulge in at public expense, involving gross sums of money, for a large number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not as though this matter relates exclusively to the behaviour of the Labor Party in Canberra. Prior to the last State election in New South Wales, we saw the Unsworth Government-one of whose the political apparatchiks, Senator Faulkner, will take part in this debate later-pour vast sums of public money into advertising campaigns of all sorts. We know that Senator Faulkner, given his particular ideological bent, was more likely to have opened champagne than hemlock when the results of that election came in. Nevertheless, we have seen consistently throughout the Labor Party this attitude to what is the proper expenditure of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter of public importance today is designed simply to draw to attention the fact that the stamp allowance is not some isolated incident. It is not some one-off, occasional occurrence. It is part of a systematic plan, which the Australian Labor Party has had in place since it was elected in 1983, to realise the opportunities available to it. It reminds me of the famous words of Leo X, the last great Medici pope who, when he was elected to the Chair of St. Peters, remarked to the College of Cardinals:</PARA>
<PARA>Seeing that it has pleased God to give us this office it is our duty bounden to enjoy it. </PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no doubt that that is precisely the attitude that the Labor Party takes to being in government. It has access to the Treasury. It has access to the administrative services network. It has access to the wherewithal to keep itself in office. So, through public funding, media free time, postage allowances, a variety of glossies, the aNiMaLS operations, the cuts to the Senate, the House of Representatives stationery allowance, the campaign by telephone paid for at public expense, the public opinion polling paid for by the Government and the price watch operation, it is determined to get as much value as it can for its $23m to $26m worth of public money improperly subverted into paying for what it should be paying for out of its own resources. The tragedy for the Australian taxpayers at the end of the day is that they have to put up with it. The one hope they can take from the whole thing is that, at the end of the day, it will not damn well work. </PARA>

The only motive the Labor Party would ever have to dip into the public purse to support itself is a fear of defeat. That fear does not exist. I think we should look at the reasons why it does not exist. It does not exist because the Opposition is a total shambles. It does not exist because the Opposition has no policies. That is why we have these red herrings drawn across the chamber today. Opposition members have no policies; they do not want to discuss the serious issues of the day. We have not got a tax policy out of them. When is that coming? It has been promised at different times but no appearance, Your Honour. The Opposition has no immigration policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw Senator Teague's attention to the Standing Orders and suggest that he read them one day. As I say, the Opposition has absolutely no policies; there is just a lot of waffle going on. Therefore, Opposition members have to come up with red herrings. In addition to having no policies, they have no leadership. Senator Puplick wants to quote Pope Leo X. The thing that the Liberal Party reminds me of is the Avignon split. It has two Popes, one in Kooyong and one in Bennelong, who alternately take leadership of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party has no leadership. I never thought the day would come when I had to feel sorry for the Liberal Party, but I do. It had poor old struggling John Howard; its members publicly butcher him. The people who butcher him admit that they deliberately lied about that. They must have broken a mirror. The moment they do it, the moment they butcher Howard, his popularity goes up; the new pope's popularity crashes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even at this moment, as they debate in this chamber, the slimy apparatchiks of the Liberal Party are out looking for a new leader, looking for a new messiah to bring them out of the cold, out of opposition. Who can they look towards? First of all, they looked to Mr Elliott as the great white hope, but unfortunately they could not get rid of Mr Shipton out of Higgins and therefore Mr Elliott could not be brought in. Anyway, he is earning a few extra million dollars through a few procedures out there in privatising a company; why should he want to come in here at fifty grand a year? So Mr Elliott is out. Then they decided that Senator Chaney might be the answer, so Senator Chaney was endorsed for a lower House seat. Maybe he is the next prospective leader. But everyone in this chamber knows that that is not on; leadership needs a special quality. Senator Chaney has all the qualities in the world but that one, unfortunately, of leadership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just for Senator Teague's information let me lay it out. Do we have a motive? Should we not be worried? I have already said that the Opposition has no policies; now it has no leadership. Thirdly, as the Opposition has proved today, it has no cohesion. Members of the Liberal Party are too busy backstabbing each other to be a cohesive force and an alternative government. We are not a particularly popular Government, amongst businesses and others. Every time we mix with them the first thing they do is criticise this Government. I accept that. But they always add, `But that Opposition; aren't they just hopeless?'. There is no cohesion at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A classic example took place this morning. I walked into this chamber and I sought to see who the shadow Minister was, leading in the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. But the shadow Minister did not lead. He had to bring in a hired gun, a very talented one, Senator Peter Baume, to do all the work on it. Because the Opposition has a shadow Minister stuck here, because it has to have a ratio with the National Party and because there is no other National willing to serve on the front bench it has to bring in a hired gun as its shadow Minister. But it so lacks cohesion that it still will not offer him a shadow Ministry. The reason is that it has already had to accommodate another 31, an all time record in this Parliament. The Opposition needed 31 shadow Ministers and it needed to give out another six or eight petty jobs to the hangers-on. That was the only way it could get a coalition together to get Mr Peacock up. Everyone had to be put on a promise. It is a pity the Opposition did not choose its shadow Ministry on the basis of ability. But it does not. I know it has a very narrow pool to regard in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> To answer Senator Teague, there are three things lacking in motive for the Labor Party: no policies; no leadership; no cohesion. When we look outside the Parliament there is a fourth reason. The Liberal Party machine is nothing short of being pathetic at the moment, absolutely pathetic. Let us look around the States. In New South Wales, it had to get rid of its State director, Starr. In Victoria Michael Kroger and company are sacking staff hand over fist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to move onto something else. Senator Knowles is just trying to waste the time of this chamber. I have not said that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is really involved here is one of the most crass exercises in hypocrisy I have ever seen in this chamber. Let us go through some of the issues raised. As regards polling, Senator Puplick says we are dipping into the public purse by using polling. Every government in the 1970s and 1980s has used polling. Opposition senators have had the list produced as to where the account goes for polling. The honourable senator just mentioned ANOP; he did not mention all the other firms or do a percentage breakdown of how much ANOP does; nor did he go to the point as to who tenders for what. It may be true that ANOP has four times the polling of, say, Roy Morgan and Co., but who tendered for the contracts? Did Morgan put in for them all? Of course he did not. The honourable senator did not mention that the various firms used by the Liberal Party are used by this Government for polling. He does not mention that his Government not only polled in 1982 but refused to release the results of those polls. He did not mention the 1982 post-Budget survey that took nine successive Estimates Committee meetings for former Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to produce. </PARA>
<PARA> So, when Senator Publick brings up the question of polling, he is doing nothing more than putting a very hypocritical Liberal Party position. In government-and I bet anything you like the Greiner Government is polling it sits by and says nothing about it; so do not bring up the question of polling.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick brings up the question of government advertising, and amnesia strikes again. The Liberal Party advertised time and time again when it was in government between 1975 and 1983. Remember the 1982 post-Budget election ads that went on. Senator Teague was here. Does he acknowledge that the Liberal Party did it? Of course it did it. In the programs for next year on government advertising we intend to spend $4.7m on an AIDS campaign-totally justified-$2.75m on a drug offensive, and $16m on defence. Every time Opposition senators quote the global figure of $35m, do they ever mention that $19m is for things like employment advertisements for the Public Service? No, they do not. They never mention those things at all; they distort the figures for their own benefit. So on the questions of polling and advertising, it is exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Opposition senators bring up the point about the aNiMaLS group. The aNiMaLS group costs somewhere between $1.2m and $1.4m-exactly the same amount as the Government Information Unit that operated when they were in government and that did the same thing as the aNiMaLS. And they all sat back. They never said a thing in that period about the Government Information Unit. They justified it. Let us have a look at that. I have here a media guide for the Liberal Party put out by the Federal Secretariat. In it they say, `You as a Liberal backbencher or as a Liberal should go and use the Government Information Unit'. So, when in government the Liberal Party used the Government Information Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another confidential document was produced in December 1978 when their government was setting up the liaison officers group. Do honourable senators not recall that? One of the requirements of these liaison officers was that they maintain close contact with party officials in the State, keeping them fully informed of developments on the Federal scene. What hypocrisy we hear from those opposite! It should be said of Trotskyists that they were simply Stalinists out of power. It seems to me that the Liberals today are simply out of power. That is the only difference that those things make. So, on the question of polling, government information, government advertising, et cetera, where is the difference?</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of public funding, that is a very common thing throughout the world. Senator Puplick says it is stealing from the public purse. The Liberals and the National Party opposed public funding in this chamber. They then took public funding. The National Party not only opposed it on principle but opposed it morally. It took the money. The moment Senator Puplick and his party took the money, they just showed how much their principles are worth. They put a price on his principles. They said, `We stand on principle on this matter but we will sell out for X amount of dollars'. So do not come in here and say public funding of election campaigns is simply stealing from the public purse; it quite clearly is not. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the other matters raised. The matter of the views on advertising of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was raised. Those are the Committee's views; they are not the Government's views yet. Honourable senators know that the Government has not responded to that report. They could also guess that it is unlikely that it will respond to that report quickly, because it involves substantive issues. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is of no use saying that the Labor Party or the Labor Government is trying to get free time on advertising. It may be, it may not be, but Senator Puplick is pre-empting a Government response that is some months away, and I can assure him that there is quite a difference of opinion within the Government on these matters. Some clearly favour free time; some clearly favour a total ban on advertising. There is an equally strong group that says to leave it as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Senator Puplick came up with another amazing statement-that there is a conspiracy to cut back Senate appropriations to reduce the effectiveness of the Senate. I do not know how well the Senate did this time vis-a-vis the House of Representatives. Generally, though, the complaint I hear continually is that the Senate, through its competence and its negotiating skills and its secretarial backup, does better comparatively than the House of Representatives in estimates. Maybe not this year but on average over the last six years the Senate has done better than the other House. To allege that there is some sort of conspiracy to cut back the Senate is nonsense. It has to be understood that the amount of money expended by government in this country as a percentage of gross domestic product has gone from 30-odd per cent to 24 per cent of gross domestic product. Every department, every institution, has been cut back, and to come up with that sort of stupid conspiracy theory simply amazes me. </PARA>
<PARA> Summarising the hypocrisy of members of the Liberal Party: they oppose public funding but they will take it; they oppose the postage increase but not one of them has said that he will hand it back; they oppose polling yet they do it themselves and do not publish the results; they oppose Government advertising yet they did it themselves; they oppose the aNiMaLs group-the National Media Liaison Service-yet they had the Government Information Unit. I ask everyone to draw his or her own conclusions. The hypocrisy really hits home when we realise how silent they are when it comes to other conservative parties in power in this country and the corruption in which they get involved in an electoral sense. In today's Australian-I did not hear Senator Teague comment on this-we see the heading `Queensland electoral office ``a gold mine for rorts'' '. So not only do we have a malapportioned electoral system, a gerrymandered electoral system, but the Nationals in Queensland make sure they have charge of the Electoral Office. Let me just quote some of the activities in the Queensland Electoral Office in the last year:</PARA>
<PARA> A superior officer had ordered him (an electoral officer) to process an enrolment form which he believed had been `blatantly and illegally witnessed' by a National Party MP in February 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Office staff were subjected to National Party intimidation `should they rock the boat'. </PARA>
<PARA> Use of deceased persons names to vote was a common practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines for the removal of the names of senile elderly people were not being followed. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have in this country a State government which not only rigs the electoral boundaries but then puts the fix in in the Electoral Office. I have never heard anyone on the other side say anything about that, and this is the great dilemma. What makes it even more pathetic is that the major victim of the boundaries, the major victim of the electoral malpractice, is the Australian Liberal Party Queensland branch. It almost reminds me of those jokes about sadists and masochists, the sadists being the Queensland National Party and the masochists being the Queensland Liberal Party: `Beat me, beat me', says the Liberal Party, and they get some sort of mutual enjoyment out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We never hear those opposite comment about those problems in Queensland, yet they are relevant. They are relevant if we want a proper, democratic process to exist in this country. We must be consistent, I believe, in defending democratic process, not selective, as a hysterical Senator Puplick has been today, not selectively quoting, saying we spend X amount of dollars on advertising when he know absolutely certainly that a lot of that money goes into standard things like tendering advertisements, et cetera. Senator Puplick should not come in here and say that the Government should not poll. I believe governments should always poll but I always say that, as much as possible, all that material should be released so that everyone gets the use of it. That is the best way to proceed. But no, Senator Puplick comes in here with some sort of selective Liberal amnesia, strutting around and saying that the Labor Party has to put its snout in the public trough to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why this debate is on today, absolutely clearly, is that the Liberal Party has lost its self-confidence. It cannot produce policies. Every time it produces a leader it comes up with a dud. It is as though it broke a mirror and got seven years bad luck. Every time Liberal senators look outside the chamber for support they see a pathetic Liberal Party machine. I always thought the Labor Party was pretty tolerant of failures. As a Labor Party member and a Collingwood supporter, year in, year out, season in, season out, we used to get drubbed. We were always tolerant. We used to give leaders three goes. We gave Bob Rose of Collingwood three or four goes to win the premiership. But here is the Liberal Party with a Federal Director, Mr Eggleton, who has been done one, two, three times-in 1983, 1984 and 1987-and they have left him there to go for the quadrella. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where most of the Liberal Party's problems lie; they do not lie with the Labor Party trying to use public funds for campaigning. We have no motive to do so. We have no need to do so. What this country needs is a competent and strong Opposition. It does not have it. It has had a very pathetic Opposition, wracked with obvious internal discord. The most classic case of this is Mr Ian Macphee. Ian Macphee has been a representative in this Parliament, I think for 15 years. He fronts up for preselection in a very acrimonious public debate and is defeated. </PARA>

Liberal Party members have a massive public brawl, they have a massive public reconciliation, they find a solution, and they cannot deliver a seat which still requires a 2 per cent swing against the Labor Party for the Liberal Party to win.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -We are debating today a matter of public importance introduced by Senator Puplick in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The systematic attempts of the Australian Labor Party to transfer the costs of its re-election campaign from its own coffers to the public purse, plundering the pockets of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been listening to Senator Ray's response to this and, given Senator Ray's acknowledged grasp of political history, he went back to consider some of the things that occurred during the Fraser Government. I would like to look forward and use the example that Senator Ray used with regard to government polling. Government polling was used quite extensively by the Fraser Government. Government polling has been extensively used by the Hawke Government. It will be extensively used by any incoming Peacock government. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an opportunity for Senator Puplick, in leading for the Liberals in this debate, to make a comment on this. He chose, however, to make a comment with regard to the public funding exercise, which I will return to later. He made a promise that he knows he will not have to deliver. When he got onto the polling exercise, quite properly, quite carefully, he made no promise. The reason for that is simple. Any elected Liberal government next year would use government polling. Any incoming Liberal government would also use a media exercise, as the Labor Party has done. Any incoming Liberal government would use every one of the current facilities which are available. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick made only one promise in regard to the whole range of items that he put forward to the Senate that he proposed to do anything about-public funding for election purposes. That was the only one about which he made any promise. I would like to respond to that because he linked the Australian Democrats with that proposition. It is perfectly true that we voted in favour of the legislation which was passed by this chamber which established public funding. As Senator Puplick knows, the Democrats will hold the balance of power in the next parliament. I say to him that we will not vote in the next parliament to overturn the public funding legislation passed by this chamber, whether the Peacock Liberal-National Party coalition or the Labor Party is in government. Of course, the Labor Party will not decide to change its mind. If the Liberals attempt to fulfil the promise uttered today by Senator Puplick, it will not be passed. Senator Puplick knows that. He can add up. He knows what the numbers in this chamber will be after the next election. They have been predetermined by the system that is in operation. It was a hollow promise. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at all of the issues raised in this debate, one finds that Senator Puplick was not able to refer to one item that a Liberal-National Party coalition, in government, would actually change. Everybody in the electorate is very much aware of these sorts of exercises. Indeed, Senator Puplick referred to the famous quote by the Medici pope, Pope Leo, that since God had given him the papacy, he was here to enjoy it. That is not applicable precisely to the Labor Party; it is applicable to governments. All governments of all political persuasions operate in the same fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment on one other issue that was raised by Senator Puplick in terms of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters that handed down a report in this chamber not long ago on a number of items, two of which have been of some public interest; that is, the complete disclosure of all electoral and party donations-a position which is the Democrat policy and has been so since the party was founded in 1977. Half of the recommendation has been implemented-that is, donations for election purposes. We hope that the other half of that recommendation of the Committee will be accepted and implemented by this Parliament. There was another recommendation with regard to free radio and television advertising. Anybody who listened carefully to Senator Ray would have got the wink and the nod that absolutely nothing will happen with regard to that in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick, in his normal histrionic fashion, relied heavily on referring to the party allegiances of Committee members. Senator Jean Jenkins, the Democrat member of the Committee, signed the majority report as a member of the Committee. It so happens that the Democrats-I do not know what the Liberals do-operate as individual senators. They listen to the evidence, weigh it up, come to a conclusion and then either sign the majority report or possibly put in a dissenting report. They operate as individual senators. We respect and support that position. Indeed, we believe that the Senate committees have been as successful as they have been only because senators have operated in that fashion. They are not party appointees; they are individual senators from a variety of parties who bring to bear all points of view on a common problem. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens as a result, further down the stream, with regard to other members of the political party to which those members belong, is a matter for the parties to decide. Within our party structure, we are not embarrassed by any report signed by any of our members, because we know that they operate in a conscientious and thorough manner. Whether we agree with them is a totally different matter. We determine that at the appropriate time, if any legislation appears in the chamber. But, as I say, those who are listening to Senator Ray will know that no such legislation will appear in this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> For the remaining time that I have I want to have a look at another matter and that is one that Senator Puplick made a fair amount of play on early in his contribution. I refer to the downstream effect with regard to public funding. I think it is important to put on the record some of the facts surrounding this exercise. There have been two elections with public funding in this country at the Federal level-the 1984 and 1987 elections. In the 1984 election the Labor Party received $3.7m approximately, the Liberal-National Party $3.4m approximately, the Democrats $500,000 and the Nuclear Disarmament Party $200,000. In the 1987 election the Labor Party received $4.8m, the Liberal-National Party $4.7m and the Democrats $0.7m. I think it is interesting that the Liberal-National Party in the 1984 election was happy to take the money-it did not have to-and in the 1987 election it took the money. I think quite wisely the Liberal and National parties took it because they accepted the inevitability of the exercise, an exercise that most Western democratic countries are moving towards if they did not get there before we did, on the basis of trying to do something about the ever-escalating costs of democratic elections. </PARA>
<PARA> But I look, then, at an item which I think is very important and that is the breakdown exercise. The exercise with regard to advertising is quite fascinating. In 1984 the amount for advertising spent on broadcasts-that is, radio and television-was $4.5m. When we get to 1987 it goes from $4.5m to $9.2m, whereas the publishing costs-that is, costs with regard to print media-went from $4.2m to $5.7m, an inflation jump. The amount spent on radio and television almost doubled and, indeed, for the total increase, if we aggregate those together from 1984 to 1987, we are looking at 137 per cent. That is extraordinary and, indeed, it is a frightening exercise. But when one looks at countries in the West with regard to the costs in that area, one cannot but be worried that the amounts of money that are necessary to engage in that particular activity have to come from somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick would lead us to believe by his contribution today that there is such a thing as a free lunch. I am here to tell him that there is no such thing as a free lunch and that political advertising, whether it is paid through the public purse or elsewhere, is paid for by the people of Australia. All of that money is paid by the people of Australia. The way it gets to political parties may differ but it is all paid by the people of Australia-every dollar. Whether they pay it on the jam and the cornflakes that they eat, or whether they pay it in their taxes, that is where the money comes from that supports the democratic process. It is not manufactured; it does not come off a rolling printing exercise somewhere. It comes out of the pockets of ordinary Australians. There is no such thing as a free lunch with regard to political advertising. One can choose how it is done, whether one wants it as a grace and favour exercise through multinationals and others buying favours of a democratically elected government or whether one wants it controlled through the public purse so that one knows that the government of the day at the end of the exercise does not owe anybody a brass razoo. </PARA>
<PARA> We had this debate on public funding and the Democrats made it very clear where we stand. I like the title of that Joint Committee's report, Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune, because that is precisely what we are talking about in this area. We believe that in our democracy the media's portrayal of political events and party policies is crucial. It is crucial for the electoral health of our democracy. We do not believe that financial resources alone from one's friends should determine which political party or which set of policies attracts the most media attention. We would hope that that may be more an independent media judgment and a judgment made in the interests of better government for the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick raised a number of points that I would like to agree with. I agree with the points he made about the $30,000 increase in the postal allowance for members of the House of Representatives. As we have said before, the way of dealing with that issue should have been through the Remuneration Tribunal. It was a disgrace, it still is a disgrace, that it was done any other way. The disparity between resources available to members of the House of Representatives and the Senate I would also like to refer to. I support, at least in part, what Senator Puplick said, not in exactly the same terms as Senator Puplick but in terms of the fact that that disparity will only cause frictions and problems for the future. It is an absurd exercise and it is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day what we need to be very much aware of is that moneys that are spent should be spent openly and in the public eye so that the people of Australia are able to make their decision about whether any government of any political persuasion or any party is bowing to pressure from special interest groups. The only way they can do that is to know where the money comes from and how it is spent. It is the openness of the exercise which is necessary. We have to look very closely-and hopefully we will do so in this Parliament and the next-at our total electoral system and make sure that that occurs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to speak in this matter of public importance raised by Senator Puplick today, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The systematic attempts of the Australian Labor Party to transfer the costs of its re-election campaign from its own coffers to the public purse, plundering the pockets of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick very neatly outlined for this chamber the ways in which this Government is sticking its hands into the till. That is probably the easiest way to put it. There is the cash register full of taxpayers' money, and in go the hands of the Executive to grab out what it can for the purpose of retaining government. It is not for the better government of this nation, not so that the children in the gallery will have a better education or a better health system, but primarily so that this Government will return to power. That is what it is all about; a systematic misuse of taxpayers' funds so that this Government can retain power. Power at all costs is what we are on about. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick outlined for us the ways in which this is happening. He referred to public funding, media free time and advertising; to a recent snout in the trough exercise, namely, the decision to give $20,500 more-$21,000 more-in stamp allowances to members of the lower House. I will return to that matter shortly. He referred to the use of glossy magazines to advertise what this Government is doing with Labor plastered all over it, not just the Federal Government but the Labor Government. Here is the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promising people this, promising them that; telling them that because of this Government they have got this, because of this Government they have got that. He gave some very good examples. I will be returning to those as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick raised the further example of the `aNiMaLS'-the National Media Liaison Service-which was so neatly used by Senator Walsh to misrepresent me this afternoon in this chamber. Perhaps I will return to that matter as well. But the taxpayers are paying for some public servants to sit around, monitor all the media programs and, as quickly as they can, rush round and put the Government's view to the Press Gallery, rush around and draw to the attention of members of the Government-not the Executive, but members of the government Party-things that they think will be useful to denigrate the Opposition; to denigrate the other side of the Parliament. That is what the `aNiMaLS' are being used for. The taxpayers are paying the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what is happening, Mr Acting Deputy President-no more, no less. Now, of course, the situation is perpetuated. The House of Representatives has this somewhat unlimited postal allowance-$30,000 worth. As the honourable member for Adelaide, Mr Pratt, says, his franking machine will suffer meltdown if he puts that many letters through it. The corollary of that is a requirement for unlimited stationery for members of the Government to peddle out into the community their views as to why they should be elected. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick went on to refer to telemarketing, and the Government paying telephone bills. The Labor Party is using this method quite shrewdly-perhaps we can regard that as a compliment-to ensure that it is re-elected. It is nothing more, nothing less than that: `Here we are-we will use taxpayers' funds to ensure that we are re-elected. We will not go out to win people over and show them that we ought to be re-elected so they will give us some money and we will do a good job and win the election; not that at all. We are the Government; let us stick our hands in the taxpayers' pockets. Rip the money out of there and get ourselves re-elected and that is what it is about'. Further examples of that were raised. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two matters I want to concentrate on-namely, the stamp allowance and the Labor Party's use of Government advertising money to produce glossy magazines to tell all and sundry what the Government is doing. I want to address some remarks made by previous speakers in this debate. I firstly want to deal with the contribution of Senator Ray. Senator Ray did not think there was any substance in this matter of public importance, that nothing needed to be said, and on that basis he thought he could extend his argument into other boring matters not related to this at all--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Faulkner" NAMEID="5K4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not say anything of the sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were in his position I would not want to come in here and have to defend the Government sticking its hands in the till either. I would use every opportunity to talk about anything other than my hands being in the till, so I can understand why he avoided the substance of the matter being raised by Senator Puplick. Everybody else can understand it too. Anybody who was listening would have understood. This matter of public importance is about the Government using Government money to fund its re-election campaign. That is what it is about-it is not about the Opposition at all-and Senator Ray did not appropriately address himself to the substance of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what he did say. He said, `Why would we want to do this? We have no fear of defeat'. Of course one only has to look at the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to see the ego that is attached there. One wonders how one human could have an ego that size; nonetheless, he does, and now Senator Ray provides us with evidence that he has the same sort of ego: `Here we are. We are invincible. No one can get rid of us'. Well, we have news for them. The Australian taxpayer will get rid of this Government at the next election. I am quite sure of that. One of the reasons they will do that is that they do not like an Executive putting its hands in the till. Australians are basically fair and they do not approve of misuse of taxpayers' funds. That is why this Government will be chucked out-because it is engaging in a systematic attempt to transfer the costs of its re-election campaign from its own coffers into the taxpayers' and the taxpayers will not wear it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray should understand that but by saying he has no fear of defeat-that Labor has no fear of defeat-he of course draws attention to another very important reason why this Government will be chucked out at the next election, and that is that it is so overconfident that it has got out of touch. It does not care what the Opposition has to say; it does not care what the man in the street has to say; it does not even care what its grassroots members have to say. This has become government no longer by the Labor Party sticking to its platform, and no longer, really, by Caucus. It is government by a Labor Executive and nothing more. We see in the papers over the last couple of days examples of where Mr Hawke, the Prime Minister, makes an announcement in the press as to what is going to happen. We are all told that at the Caucus meeting the Labor members, like good little lap-dogs, will go along with what the Prime Minister and the Executive say. It is not the Caucus deciding what will be done; it is the Labor Executive deciding what will be done. That is why the Government is out of touch. I thank Senator Ray for his contribution, for admitting how overconfident his Government is and highlighting in that respect exactly why it will be chucked out at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray then went on to outline some reasons why he thought members of the Government could be overconfident. None of them related to the good job they were doing, and I can understand that. If I were on the Government side I would not want to come into this chamber and say they were doing a good job when in my heart of hearts I knew the country was going down the tube, as indicated by Senator Hill's question today. We are third on the list of international debtors, and above some South American countries. We have gone down the Argentinean road, and way beyond. So I would not want to come into this chamber and express confidence in being re-elected on the basis of what my government had done if I were them. I would do what Senator Ray did; I would come in here and try to chop us up in that respect and I would try to say we had a lack of policies. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a line being peddled by `aNiMaLS' and by the Labor Party. I have here-and Senator Ray can have it if he wants-a list of our policies. We have issued the following policies: a schools policy; an arts policy; an environment policy; a sports policy; a transport policy; an acquired immune deficiency syndrome policy; an Aboriginal affairs policy; an aviation policy; an employment and training policy; a communications policy; a community services policy; a foreign affairs policy; a heritage policy; a higher education policy; a housing policy; an immigration and ethnic affairs policy; an industrial relations policy; an industry policy; a law and justice policy; a primary industry policy; a public administration policy; details of our policy on privatisation; a resources and energy policy; a retirement incomes policy; a science policy-sadly neglected by this Government; a technical and further education policy; a tourism policy; a veterans' affairs policy; and Future Directions, which provides a general outline of the Liberal Party's direction. I seek leave to table these documents, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have tabled the so-called lack of Liberal policies. One of the reasons Senator Ray says he is very confident is that we do not have any policies. Senator Bolkus says he wants to see them because he has not read them. No wonder he has not read them. That is why we are in the mess that we are in now. If the Government had read our policies it would have done a slightly better job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to have tabled in Parliament the very extensive list of well researched Liberal Party policies. I would not be so confident if I were Senator Ray. As for the lack of leadership, that is a tired old joke. Everybody knows that we had a change of leadership earlier this year. That has been done. We have a new leader, and that is that. There is no point to make in that at all. He says we have no cohesion. I would like to table in this place, if I had it with me now, a list of newspaper articles showing the disagreement in Government ranks about where to go and what to do. It would be so big that I would need a trolley to wheel it in here. So I do not see that the Government should be confident in that respect, either. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray says that he wants to defend the democratic process and go to the serious issues. Well, let us go to them. Let us go to the question of whether we want government by Executive or by Parliament. Let us do that by virtue of the stamp issue. Let us just look at what should have happened there. We had a Remuneration Tribunal decision to pay senators and members $9,000 in stamps. The Government wanted to put its hands in the till because it wanted to give more money to marginal seat members to make sure that they held those marginal seats. My premise is: power, and power at any cost. So it decided to chuck out the Remuneration Tribunal decision. We are not talking about bending the rules, Mr Acting Deputy President. We are not only talking about breaking them; we are talking about ripping them up and throwing them out of the window. The Government decided to give itself a $30,000 advantage in the marginal seats. How did it do this? By ministerial letter. That is all that is needed now to spend millions of dollars of taxpayers' money: a simple ministerial letter. The Government says, `That will do. Let's put our snouts in the trough'. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers ought to say whether they have an interest in the Government being returned. Would they like their superannuation boosted by staying on the front bench of a government rather than being in opposition? Let us see what self-interest there is. The whole purpose of this place, and I mean by that not just the Senate but the House of Representatives as well, the whole purpose of Parliament, is to keep a check on the Executive. That is what we are here for. If we are going to have the country run by the Executive, by ministerial letter, then why do we not just install fax machines around the country and let them do what they like? The stupidity of that suggestion indicates why we do not do it and why this Government should not be allowed to get away with it, constantly putting its snout in the trough. </PARA>
<PARA> A former Government member at least understood. I have raised this matter before but I will raise it again. Senator Murphy, much admired by many members on the other side, understood that Parliament is not the Government. He said it may be ordinary, it may be annual, it may even be regarded as a service, but it is not a service of the Government, and that is the mistake members of this Government are making. They think this entire place is a service that they grant by ministerial letter. The Senate appropriations have been cut down because Senator Walsh thinks we do not need that much money. If I was doing what this Government is doing I would not want the Senate to have greater power to scrutinise what it was doing either. We are talking today about a very serious and substantial matter. I am sorry if Senator Ray does not realise just how serious it is for Parliament to have the opportunity to scrutinise what the Executive is doing, and that is what has happened with this stamp issue. It has been virtually removed from the Senate's power to scrutinise it. The Government might have a few surprises in store in that respect, but we could return to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I support Senator Puplick in raising the matter of the systematic attempt of the Australian Labor Party to transfer the costs of its re-election campaign away from its own coffers, its own pockets, and into those of the taxpayer. The taxpayers will not put up with it. The taxpayer regards it as crooked, as a rip-off. Senator Ray's confidence is very sadly misplaced, and that is why this Government will be chucked out at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must seem very strange to the taxpayers who are listening to this debate that 34 people in Australia who sit on the other side of the Parliament are perpetrating the farce that somehow, with the problems confronting Australia, this is the biggest issue on which we should be concentrating our attention. We should not be talking about industrial relations because those opposite do not have a policy; they are too confused. We should not be talking about the economy because in all that wonderful list of policies there is no economic policy. We should not be talking about health because they are turning on their own committee members who dare to agree with the Government. We should not be talking about tax because that policy is no longer operative. So the Opposition says, `We will try to divert attention back to the glories of the past, to when we won a campaign about the Australia Card, when we won a campaign about the referendum. We do not have to be for anything then. Here is something we can just be opposed to'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concrete parts of the democratic issues before us were not referred to at all by Senator Vanstone, I regret to say. I want to concentrate my contribution on two things. The poor people listening who are taxpayers must have been very confused. They would have thought-listening to Senator Puplick and Senator Vanstone they would have been misled on this matter-that the stamps that are going to be provided from public funds somehow rather magically go only to the Labor Party, whereas of course everybody knows they go equally to all the parties. It is a legitimate matter of public debate whether or not those initiatives ought to be taken. It is not legitimate to pretend that somehow or other it is a peculiarly Labor Party initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two big issues of democracy in this matter of public funding and disclosure. One is the question of the response to the report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters on election advertising and the provision of free time and the second is about disclosure. Although I think the people who have prepared this report, Who pays the piper calls the tune, have raised some important issues, I do not agree with what they have proposed. They have raised the issue. It is very important. It ought to be addressed and I intend to do that-it is a pity nobody else has-but I do not agree with their conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in Australia we have to be more conscious of the fact-and the Opposition chooses to ignore it because it does not suit them-that the Recruit scandal of Japan is only one step away from Australia. In my view, and I think there is no-one in this Senate more able to accurately assess this matter, the next election will cost the major parties in Australia approximately $50m. Once expenditure starts to get to that level the fundraising pressures upon the political parties are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Mr Tony Eggleton, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party: I do not believe there is corruption in Australian politics despite that enormous pressure. I think we are lucky, and Tony Eggleton is one of the people who get credit for that. I regard him as an honest man. But we have to stop the corruption before it happens and not have the problem, as they do in other countries, of rooting it out afterwards. That is why the Committee has done us a favour by raising the profile of that particular matter, although I do not agree with its solution. There is enormous pressure on political parties when the level of political electoral funding gets to that height. It is easy for parties supported, or who think that they are going to be supported, by the wealthy people to ignore this issue and pretend that Australia is unique. Every country confronted by this problem has had to face up to the fact that the potential for corruption exists. There are people like Mr Fitzgerald who have found exactly the problem that can arise when these excesses occur. </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that what is wrong with the Committee's proposal is that it discriminates between political parties and others. I do not believe we can have a situation where electoral advertising is free to political parties and banned for everybody else. My view is that it should be banned altogether. There should be no electoral advertising. There is all sorts of hysterical nonsense being talked about how this is antidemocratic. There is no democratic right to buy elections. There is no democracy in measuring arguments by their quantity rather than their quality. That is what the existing situation means. It means that the people with the most money get the most say. That is not democracy; that is in fact plutocracy, and it is a very standard feature of democracies in the Western world that paid political advertising is not permitted. There is no paid political advertising in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland or the United Kingdom-all legitimate democracies. </PARA>
<PARA> I sometimes wonder why the Liberal Party does not kick Margaret Thatcher out of the Liberal Democratic Union or whatever it is they are in. Countries in that Union have no paid political advertising, they have public funding of political parties, they have first past the post voting, they do not have any states. It must be terribly antidemocratic but they still meet with her because, of course, Britain is a very proud democracy and it does not allow parties to have their say measured by the amount of money that they can raise, and nor should it. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing system favours both the major parties and all the powerful interest groups, against minority groups, against minor political parties, against single issue groups which do not have the support of the great and the powerful. We should equalise that matter and there should be no political advertising. As I have said, it is not uncommon in Western democracies. For example, in the majority there is none and in those few where there is some, such as Canada, there is no political advertising in the last 28 days. In the United States, of course, they get a de facto subsidy because the television channels are in fact required to provide at a lower price. </PARA>
<PARA> I do believe that there needs to be a change. I do not support the Committee's proposal. I think election advertising should be banned and I think there should be a reduction in public funding to political parties as a consequence. The consequences of that would be that we would have to campaign for elections through the news programs, through current affairs, through talk-back radio, through getting out and talking to the electors, and I support doing those things. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of the coin, which I support, and which is the other side of dealing with the looming problem of the enormous cost of elections, is disclosure. What we need to ask is: Why will not the Liberal Party support disclosure? We know why the National Party of Australia will not support it; it has been exposed in Queensland and in New South Wales. Is it that the members of the Liberal Party are just wimps, being run by the National Party again, or have they got something to hide?</PARA>
<PARA> There are some things about funding of elections in Australia in recent times that have not come out, and it is time they did. For example, in the 1987 election the biggest company in Australia had a debate at its board meeting about donations to political parties. The question of whether it should donate to both parties was raised. This is, of course, the board of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. What did it decide? It decided to donate $125,000 to the Liberal Party and nothing to anybody else. That is why the Liberal Party does not want disclosure; it does not want people to find out about that. That has not yet been disclosed. That is why it does not want public funding. It wants that sort of special advantage over everybody else-not just over us in the Labor Party, although particularly us-because it got $125,000 and we got nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know because a disaffected person, who was there and who thought it was an outrage, rang me. If anybody wants to deny it, let them deny it. My view is that donations to all political parties should be disclosed. I have always supported that; I continue to support it. There should have been the capacity for spot checks-random audits of political parties. I am proud to say that we invited the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct a random audit of the Labor Party. But when the random audit chose the Liberal Party and the National Party, they took the Electoral Commission to court and it was not allowed to happen. I regret to say that they prevailed. The court upheld their view. It may well have been correct as a matter of law-I am not at all arguing that-but it is terrible as a matter of principle. There should be random audits of political parties to see whether they are complying with the disclosure provisions, but there are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have in Australia a situation, defended by the Liberal and National parties, where big and powerful companies can try to buy the election. Political parties can be advantaged by the decisions of a few in a board room to the extent of getting $125,000 and therefore gain for the party which they support an unfair advantage in the election. It is that unfair advantage that this is all a smokescreen to try to defend. It has nothing to do with concern for the taxpayers. The Opposition parties take everything that is on offer. What they are saying is, `The old system used to give us an advantage; we used to get $125,000 while others got nothing'. They want to protect that. That can be repeated in the board rooms all around Australia. That is what they are trying to defend-the benefits of the wealthy. I do not want only the Labor Party to get it; I do not want anybody to have the advantage. I believe there should be none of that election advertising and that there should be a full disclosure of donations made. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had situations in the past where queries have been raised about decisions that have been made by governments, and whether they bore any relationship to donations. It is a matter I will come back to in the Parliament. I wish I had time to discuss it now. I am not making any accusations of corruption because I believe Australia has been very lucky. But we should not push our luck too far. We should set up a system that makes the political process transparent and equal. It is not a democratic system, it is not the ultimate in democracy, if we have a situation in which some people can get hundreds of thousands of dollars-both major parties are in this category-and spend several million dollars on their campaign but others can spend nothing. It is not an egalitarian society when some powerful interest groups can run very big election advertising campaigns but the opposing group has no funds to compete. That is not an election which expresses the equal voice of the people. It is not people being able to consider arguments on their merits. I have great problems with the existing system, significantly better as it is than anything that has gone before it, because we still have the situation where the capacity of people to successfully compete in elections is measured by the quantity of the argument, not the quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course I do not underestimate the voters. They can see through the most transparent of lies that are sometimes told in advertising. Sometimes the person with the most money does not win. That is to the great credit of the Australian people and there is the capacity for alternative views to be developed. We need to remove the hurdles from the people who do not have the support of the wealthy, who do not have the unfair advantage, and say, `This election ought to be an equal contest between people who have the capacity to put forward ideas and to compete equally to win the support of the Australian public for those ideas'. It is sad that we have to divert the resources of the Parliament that have been dealing with important legislation to pursue this irrelevant tangent that Senator Puplick has tried to beat up as a smokescreen to cover inadequacy in other areas and to cover the desire to maintain an unfair advantage in another. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that this debate has given me the opportunity, which I was going to take in another forum to put before the people of Australia, to put forward my views from my experience in election campaigning about how election campaigns ought to be restructured and financed in the hope that we can get an equal go in election campaigns in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever we needed evidence that the Labor Party is the party of political immorality, of total disregard for the rights of the Australian electorate and Australian taxpayer, we have received that evidence in this debate today. The contribution to this debate on a matter of public importance by Senator Ray, one of the most senior members in the Government, is a disgrace. Senator Ray absolutely and totally refused to debate the issue, namely, the `systematic attempts by the Australian Labor Party to transfer the costs of its re-election campaign from its own coffers to the public purse, plundering the pockets of the Australian taxpayer'. To his credit, at least Senator McMullan-who, I am sorry to see, is not prepared to sit and listen to this debate, now that he has made his contribution-attempted to address some of the issues. But what he did was simply to strengthen the case that is set out in the wording of the matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without canvassing all of Senator McMullan's remarks, let me comment at least on two that are of critical importance. He talked about the ban on political advertising and about the requirement of disclosure provisions. The reason why Senator McMullan and the Labor Party want disclosure of donations or sources of income for political parties for the day-to-day ongoing operations of those parties-and let us not forget that disclosure is already required by the law for donations for the funding of election campaigns-is that the party that would not be disadvantaged by that proposal is the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why the Labor Party would not be disadvantaged is that it draws such an enormous proportion of its funding for its ongoing activities from the trade union movement. There is a formal and a legal link between the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party whereby the trade union movement is required by its laws to fund the Labor Party. That does not apply, of course, with the Liberal Party or the National Party or, for that matter, any other party that I am aware of. So the disclosure provisions that Senator McMullan and the Labor Party are seeking are, of course, simply a thinly disguised attempt to strangle the financial prospects of the other parties and to advantage the Labor Party. It is a matter that has been debated before, it will be debated again and I will not go on with it here. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to remind the Senate what this debate today is all about and to ask the Senate to think why this debate is taking place now. Why are the proposals that we are expressing the gravest concern about in this debate coming forward now? Why have they been so rampant in the last 12 months? The simple reason, of course, is that the Hawke Government is desperate to hold on to power, to win the next election. It will attempt to do so by any means at its disposal regardless of the morality or the immorality of its actions and it will not, therefore, shirk in the slightest degree from plundering the pockets of Australian taxpayers to achieve its objectives. It is carefully, clinically, systematically, calculatedly and deliberately abusing the trust of the Australian electorate by misappropriating, plundering, stealing tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars each year to achieve its naked, totally political ends. </PARA>
<PARA> This course follows a long tradition by the Labor Party federally and at State level that has become all too familiar in the Australian scene. To give just two recent examples, we all know about the activities of the Wran and then the Unsworth governments in New South Wales and the amount of rorting of the public purse that took place under those governments. Thank heaven, in the end, the electors of New South Wales saw their way through it and threw out the Unsworth Government, but not before a great cost to the taxpayers of New South Wales and a great cost to the electorate and the people of Australia because of the actions that were taken by the Federal Government in terms of economic policy and the laxity of monetary policy that were pursued to try to get the Unsworth Government back into office. That has cost us very dearly as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of Victoria the examples of expenditure for purely political purposes, the expenditure of taxpayers' money by the Cain Government in recent years, have been legion. I give great credit to members of my own Party at the State level, particularly the Hon. Mark Birrell for the exposure that he has given to the expenditure by Premier Cain of taxpayers' money on opinion polls and attitude surveys conducted at an expense of millions of dollars, the latest figure being $3m personally commissioned by Premier Cain simply with the purpose of testing the electoral water for the election prospects of the Cain Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I am pleased to see here my colleague Senator Alston, who played an important role in those activities. What is happening at the Federal level is following a long tradition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick and Senator Vanstone have already outlined in considerable detail the examples of this quite immoral rape of the public purse through Labor's public funding policy and its unconscionable proposal to increase the postage allowance for members of the House of Representatives by more than threefold, an action which, on advice we have received, is illegal. We will fight that matter if our legal opinions are confirmed; we will fight that matter in the High Court because illegality is the hallmark of the Government in the use of public funds and we will not allow it to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's provision of unlimited stationery to members of the House of Representatives and the postage allowance are for one purpose alone; that is, to give publicly funded resources of tens of thousands of dollars-$30,000-to each marginal Labor member of the House of Representatives, to flood his or her electorate with political propaganda in the run-up to the next election. That is the only reason these changes are being proposed. I mention also Labor's grand telemarketing schemes and its massive expenditure on advertising campaigns which Senator Puplick and Senator Vanstone have so ably demonstrated. The sole objective of those advertising campaigns is to promote the Labor Party and its so-called leading lights. We have seen the development to a high art form of scurrilous political propaganda through the National Media Liaison Service-the Labor Party's new thought police; Australia's Goebbels machine of the 1980s. There are many more examples, such as the Government's price watch network, which is nothing more than another thoroughly improper use of taxpayers' money to provide additional resources to Labor members of parliament in marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to taxpayers of these various operations is impossible to calculate exactly, because many of the costs are hidden in the Budget Papers. In effect those costs are laundered. So any estimate one might make based on the Budget figures are therefore likely to be highly conservative. Even on that highly conservative basis, the items we have listed today would total a minimum of well in excess of $50m. That is not a once-only figure, because most of those costs are annual costs. Not only that, they are increasing annual costs. Most of those items of expenditure have seen rapid increases in recent years. I am absolutely certain that the taxpayers of Australia do not know, or have not been aware previously, that in excess of $50m of their money is going year in, year out to attempt to shore up the purely political prospects of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government or any party wants to promote itself, of course it ought to be able to do so. But it ought to do it with its own funds. It ought not to do it-it is illegal; it is immoral for it to do it-with publicly contributed funds from the taxpayers. That is why we object so violently to the majority recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which proposed a total ban on paid political advertising and, instead, the provision of free time during election campaigns on radio and television, paid for by some section of the community other than the political parties themselves. Again there is a basic immorality that pervades that proposal that is a matter of the gravest concern. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other things one could say about the political advertising proposals to which I now want to turn. The free time proposal, as I have said, is the brainchild of the Labor members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, supported, I must point out, by the Australian Democrats. Those proposals were rejected by the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee for several fundamental reasons. The proposals would involve a major form of censorship in this country; they are undemocratic; they are draconian; they are totalitarian; and they are illogical. That view has been widely supported in the media, even by the print media which possibly stands to gain by those proposals. Michelle Grattan in the Age, for example, also described them as a draconian set of proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole focus of the Government's activities is concerned with shoring up its political support. If it wants to shore up its political support, that is fine. But let it do it at its own expense. Let it not do it at the expense of plundering the public purse and the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is not just about money. It goes to the whole essence of our political democratic system. The electors have lost a lot of confidence in the political processes in this country of ours. They are concerned by what they perceive as a lack of integrity in government. No political democracy can survive if the government of the day deliberately, wilfully and cynically prostitutes the system and the electors for its own political self-interest, and that is what this debate is all about. That is why it is so important. That is why this plundering of the public purse must end, and it will end at the next election when the Australian electorate rejects this immoral Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get to the motivation behind Senator Puplick's matter of public importance, I want to place very clearly on the record my support of the principle of the public funding of election campaigns. That is not a principle that is unique only to Australia. It is an accepted principle right around the world-in the United States, Canada, Sweden and Great Britain, to name just a few countries. It was interesting to listen to Senator Puplick and Senator Vanstone talk about the question of mail entitlements for members of the House of Representatives. In Great Britain, every candidate for every seat in the House of Commons is able to send a letter to each elector after the close of nominations. That letter is originally paid for by the post office, which is later reimbursed by the Treasury. In fact, the last statistics that I saw related, I think, to an election in Great Britain in 1974, where the public paid for some 75 million articles going through the post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also worth remembering that in many other countries electoral enrolment is the responsibility of candidates and parties as opposed to the situation we have in Australia, where it is the responsibility of the Electoral Office. We ought to be entirely honest about the fact that the cost of election campaigns has risen dramatically over recent years, particularly in the last decade. I recall reading recently that in the New South Wales election of 1897 William Holman who won the seat of Grenfell, scoring 1,115 votes for the Labor Party against his protectionist opponent's 892, managed to cycle around his whole electorate of Grenfell and meet and talk to every single elector. I recently saw some figures relating to the election campaign fought by the Australian Labor Party Federal Executive in 1946. The Labor Party in that year spent #650 on its Federal election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to be very honest. Over recent times there have been dramatic changes to the technology of election campaigns and the whole nature of election campaigns, and everyone in this Parliament knows it. We have the expense of radio. We have the expense of television. We have the expense of sophisticated polling. Those expenses are not unique to the Labor Party; every party has to deal with them. Of course, there is a growing tendency for centralisation of election campaigns. I notice that Senator Beahan, speaking in the Senate on 16 August, talked about a 60-second spot in prime time Sydney television costing $9,000. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Also, between 1984 and 1987 television and radio costs, mainly as a result of the television component, rose by 137 per cent while public funding, which is related to the consumer price index, rose by only 31.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Those costs are borne by all political parties. It is true also, of course, in local House of Representatives campaigns. It does not matter whether it is just the cost of newspaper advertising or the cost of printing or whatever it is; it has tended to rise above the level of inflation. The costs of printing paper, ink, printing costs, labour costs and so forth have gone up astronomically. All parties, all candidates, have to bear those costs. Of course, the reality of Australian politics is that when one political party produces an election tactic, the other political party needs to respond immediately. That is the story of Australian elections over the past 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition's attitude to public funding is a fairly typical response from the conservatives. Frankly, it is just what we would expect. These people believe that they are born to rule; they believe that their proper place is on this side of the chamber, and not over there. Any means justify the ends, of course, for the conservatives, and they do not care about conventions that are established over a long period. The conventions of the Parliament, of course, in large measure relate to the rights of an opposition. There is no doubt-and we hear the Liberals and the National Party talk about it all the time-that democracy benefits from a vibrant two-party system. We hear any amount of lip-service from the Opposition about the critical role that the Opposition plays in the Parliament. I say to Opposition senators: To have an effective opposition, you need to have a capacity for an effective political campaign; of course, to have an effective political campaign in this day and age, you need to have public funding. Frankly, for the Government or the Opposition, for the Australian Democrats, for any independent candidate at all, to campaign effectively they need public funding. Hobbling democracy is not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look at the real motivations of this matter of public importance that has been proposed by Senator Puplick. Of course, members of the Opposition have nothing to talk about at the moment. I think we all know and accept that they are a leaderless rabble, and that they believe that any issue they might care to come up with that diverts attention from the internal problems of the Opposition is fair enough to waste a couple of hours time in this chamber. But I want to talk about what this matter of public importance is all about today. If honourable senators do not know, they only have to go to page 8 of the Sydney Morning Herald of today, which contains a small article by Phillip Clark headed: `Frost quits as moderates win'. This is all about the New South Wales Liberal Party. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Liberal party has formally accepted the resignation of its finance vice-president, Mr Bob Frost. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Frost's resignation was not unexpected and followed a victory by moderate forces in the recent elections for the senior executive leadership of the NSW party. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick has hoped desperately that in this debate I would expose what this matter of public importance is all about. I give Senator Puplick this commitment: I intend to do it. I am going to talk about the internal affairs of the New South Wales Liberal Party. He hopes someone in the Government would take this opportunity, and I intend to. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, on 29 August in the Sydney Morning Herald there was a fascinating article. I must say it was one of the best articles I have ever read in an Australian newspaper. It was headed `A final blow for Bob Frost, the Lib who came to lunch'. Senator Alston might learn something about what this matter of public importance is really all about. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Bob Frost is not expected to remain finance vice-president of the NSW Liberal Party-effectively the party's chief bagman-following elections which saw the dumping of the party president of two years, Dr Ron James, and other senior officials in a rebuff to the ``Dries'' associated with Senator Bronwyn Bishop.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The NSW Liberals have also soon become familiar with Bob Frost's little luxuries. Two years ago he was appointed to the money-raising job by Senator Bishop, who was then the NSW State President. Not long after, staff at the party's Riley Street headquarters noticed that he was also rather good at spending money. </PARA>
<PARA>The article then quotes a banker friend of Mr Frost:</PARA>
<PARA>`Christmas '87 one of the officials was sent out to a wine merchant at Mascot to pick up what he thought would be a few bottles for the staff party. When he got there, he found a whole shed-full of it . . . champagne, whisky, you name it. He drove back with his car full to the gunwales. God knows who paid for it . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As the election approached, the partying intensified. The night before the poll, Frost organised a champagne binge at party headquarters for a group of supporters, some of whom became overcome with excitement. The following day Liberal officials were still mopping up the vomit from the carpets. </PARA>
<PARA>But the real story is this:</PARA>
<PARA>The first blowfly dropped in the Bollinger last October when this newspaper-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Sydney Morning Herald-</PARA>
<PARA>revealed that Frost had been the middleman in a scheme to provide four of Nick Greiner's staff with cars. Although the Premier denied that there was any conflict of interest, it caused enormous embarrassment and at least two of the cars were returned. </PARA>
<PARA> Then came the revelations of the shadowy Community Polling organisation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick wants me to talk about this. He wants me to get stuck into Bronwyn Bishop and Community Polling. Let us see what the Liberal Party organised in New South Wales. Who was in Community Polling? It was a fellow called Kortlang who was recently on the staff of Mr Peacock, the Leader of the Opposition. He was intimately involved in Community Polling. So was Dr Metherell, the New South Wales Minister for Education. In fact, the Community Polling operation was run out of his office. It was channelling Liberal Party funds into bogus independent candidates to support independent campaigns. After a while it got a bit hot in Dr Metherell's office. </PARA>

Unfortunately I have not got time to talk about the recent expose in the Independent Commission Against Corruption hearings relating to certain events on the north coast of New South Wales. But it is the same old National Party story that Senator McGauran would know all about-rorts and more rorts. In Queensland, of course, the only way the National Party worries about public funding is the bundles of notes wrapped up in brown paper bags being passed around the place.

Where was he when this unbridled corruption was going on? That is why the Labor Government has weighed in with the old party machine men to defend and to flank the Prime Minister's grab for the public purse. Anyone who has been listening to this particular debate will surely know that there has been only one defence by the Government towards accusations of having its snout in the trough in the grab for the public purse. The Government has only one defence and that is that it is the spoils of power; `Everyone does it. Others would do the same, so let's do it'. There is no consideration for the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we know that the costs of election campaigns have skyrocketed over the years but why should the public pay for them? What is the point of that? Why should the public pay for the escalation in the cost of election campaigns? Let us pull away the veil that this Government is trying to throw over this particular issue. It is simply and utterly a grab by the Government for the public purse to fund its next election campaign. This is a run-up to the next election. There is absolutely no doubt about that and the reason that the Government does not want it brought forward is that if it can do it quietly it will get away with it. The Government should not let the public know because once the public knows it will not support the Government's arguments. There is no way the public will support those particular arguments, that the Government should fund its election campaigns through the public purse. That is undemocratic and it denies to other individual groups, which may want to advertise on television, the right to be able to speak out. It is simply undemocratic and against individual rights. The point to be made about this snoffs in the trout accusation against the Government is that it is systematic.

If one wants evidence of that, one need only read today's newspapers to see that Bob Hogg has now intervened. He has slightly changed his mind on how they will go about suppressing normal advertising on television. Bob Hogg now says they should go in another direction, and the Government has taken up his particular suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever way the ALP party machine is thinking on a particular day is the direction in which the Government will head. The evidence of the ALP party machine's interference in the run-up to this election comes not only from Bob Hogg, but also, as I say, from the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who Pays the Piper Calls The Tune. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The first thing I want to say is that although I think the Australian Archives as currently constituted does an excellent job, I actually believe it is in the wrong place. I do not believe it should be part of the Department of Administrative Services. I believe it should be part of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. In that way its activities would be more effectively integrated with the other collecting institutions-in particular, the National Library. I know that a lot of the work that it performs is a direct government service. I do not in any way want to denigrate that. I think that is important and must continue and, of course, in whichever department it is located, it will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the opportunity during this year to have some very interesting discussions with members of the Australian Society of Archivists about the framework within which they work, the nature of their activities and the nature of the work going on in the Australian Archives. If one looks at other countries, one will find that their archives are treated as a national institution. The Archives must continue to supply the basic government services that they now supply, and I support that without any equivocation or suggestion for change. I think that the records kept by the national Archives are also a significant contribution to the study of our history. Any student of history wishing to pursue records with regard to a particular matter would want to have access to the National Library of Australia, the Australian War Memorial, perhaps in future the National Museum of Australia, and the Archives. I think that that integration is important and it is something that I want to raise for consideration. I do not expect it to be a front-page story tomorrow. I do not think it is a matter of great, paralysing public interest. But in the interest of proper public administration it is a question that ought to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, having taken the opportunity to speak on this report, I congratulate the people at the Archives on the excellent and essentially unheralded work that they do. Thirdly, I want to raise a long-term question which is raised in the annual report about the need for a national building for the Australian Archives. It is not, unlike the National Museum and other matters, something that I think is imminent and that ought to happen tomorrow. We do not pay sufficient attention to our history, our culture and the development of our nation. The archives building in Washington plays an important part in that city and in the nation as a recognition of the importance of American history. </PARA>
<PARA> The Advisory Council on the Australian Archives is correct to view this proposal as a long term consideration. It would not be a top priority were I listing public works initiatives in this area, but I think the Council has taken the appropriate attitude. I support the proposal. I support the excellent work being done by the Archives and I hope that the suggestion concerning its appropriate place within the administrative framework of the national government might be considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare is a very valuable and useful report. I congratulate the members of the Committee and its research staff. The whole history of the Select Committee on Animal Welfare has been interesting. It will be recalled that when the Committee was first established-Senator Georges was its initial chairman-some criticism was made about the establishment of the Committee and what its impact might be in a large number of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far, the Committee has demonstrated that it has done extremely valuable work in all areas. As a result of its investigation of the kangaroo industry substantial improvements have been made in the way that trade is monitored and regulated. In relation to its comments on the investigation of live sheep exports, again there have been improvements. It will be interesting to know, when a final analysis is made of the current problems we are having with live sheep exports to the Middle East, whether following the Senate Committee's recommendations in toto might not have been the way to go. The Committee's report on the keeping of cetacea in captivity effectively laid to rest a large part of the debate about the inappropriateness of keeping cetacea in captivity. I am glad to see that in New South Wales, in particular, steps have been taken, acting on the basis of the Senate Committee's work and advice, to try to reduce the number of cetacea kept in captivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night when this report was tabled, Senator Brownhill drew attention to the fact that the impact that the Committee has had in its preliminary work, even before its report came down, was very much related to cleaning up the acts of the various universities and research schools around the place. In fact, they were required to take proper notice of some of the criticisms being made externally of their work and their operation, and the increasing role of ethics committees and of public scrutiny of the universities in relation to their use of animals for experimental purposes has led to substantial improvements being made all round. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator Calvert in his remarks last night also drew attention to the fact that the Committee will be going on to investigate the operation of the racing industry, the treatment of racehorses and the treatment of greyhounds. Although I no longer have a direct interest in the matter, perhaps I should declare myself as a person who has had a long and very interesting association with the greyhound racing industry over many years and I look forward to the recommendations which that Committee may come up with. If they would like to call me I would be more than happy to tell them what effect it has on a racing greyhound if somebody slips him half a pound of butter half an hour before the race starts. Nevertheless, the way in which the animals are actually treated is an important issue to be addressed by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes a number of recommendations which are extremely important. It recommends, for example, an increase in the publication of data about animal experimentation and the use of animals in experiments in Australia. The British Home Office has had enormous success over many years in keeping and publishing effective records about the use of animals in experiments. Those records have, I think, by and large allayed a large number of fears expressed by animal welfare groups in the United Kingdom. I am delighted to see the recommendation for the Draize test to be banned in Australia. It is an appalling test which effectively amounts to this: take a large number of white rabbits, put them into machines which collar their heads, tilt their heads upwards, pin back their eyelids and drop substances into their eyelids until enough of them go blind to demonstrate whether or not the products, which are nearly exclusively cosmetic products-shampoos, perfumes and things of that nature-are sufficiently acceptable to be put on the market. With the rise of genetic engineering and the capacity to undertake cell tests, the Draize test is certainly no longer necessary and I am glad to see the recommendation for its abolition. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there is a recommendation for the ban of the classical LD50 test. If anybody should ask, `What is an LD50 test?', LD means lethal dose. What dose does one have to give animals to get to the stage where 50 per cent of them die? Again, the capacity to replace that test certainly exists technically, and the Committee recommends that a classical LD50 test be prohibited but that the Minister be able to approve acute toxicity tests, which of course continue to be necessary for the proper testing of pharmaceutical products, veterinary products and medical products which at this stage do not have appropriate non-animal alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes three recommendations in regard to a body called the Australian Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching: firstly, that ACCART plays a role in drawing up appropriate guidelines and standard operating procedures for the capture of wildlife and their housing, nutrition and management in captivity; secondly, that it undertakes a study to determine the most effective means for production planning of laboratory animals in terms of minimising excess production; and, thirdly, that ACCART prepares guidelines on procedures and practices in relation to animal experimentation to supplement the code of practice. Here I declare a very clear personal interest in the matter. ACCART is a body sponsored by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the National Health and Medical Research Council. It has some 13 members on its executive and they are drawn predominantly from the scientific and technical and university community, from the CSIRO, from departments of primary industry around the States, and from the National Health and Medical Research Council. However, ACCART has two lay members who were invited to join that body to provide some external input to the work of ACCART and they comprise a distinguished lawyer from Melbourne and me. So I have been directly involved as one of the two lay members of the Australian Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching, which has made a submission to this particular Senate inquiry and which has now published a newsletter and a series of monographs is under way which deal with questions about animal housing, about testing procedures, about the physiology and biology of experimental animals and about the practices which ought to be undertaken as far as laboratory animals and their care is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in August 1987, I was able to give an address to the annual general meeting of the Australian Society of Laboratory Animal Scientists in Sydney under the heading, The Dilemma of Animals, Real and Political, in which I spent some time basically putting forward the proposition that it is necessary for those who are engaged in scientific activity such as this to accept as a fact of life the increasing public scrutiny of what it is that they are doing and to accept that as a positive element, not a threat, not a negative element but a positive element which will only increase in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains absolutely necessary for the public health purposes of Australia to continue to use animals in medical and veterinary experiments. There is no alternative for their total removal available at this stage. But cruelty to those animals must be minimised, the number of animals must be minimised, and the alternatives to the use of animals must be more appropriately pursued. I believe that this Committee report makes a significant contribution to advancing the debate in that regard. I hope it will be seriously read and studied by honourable senators and by others who are concerned with this particular matter, and, indeed, by members of the wider community. I conclude my remarks as I began, by congratulating the members of the Senate, their staff and researchers for the production of this excellent report. </PARA>

Accordingly, I now seek leave to have that statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The report brings to a conclusion an inquiry that was begun in 1986 during the 34th Parliament by our predecessor Committee, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, under the Chairmanship of Senator Gordon McIntosh. </PARA>
<PARA> The other members of the former Committee were:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Black</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sir John Carrick and</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hamer, who is also a member of the present Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook and the former Senator Wood are former members of the present Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference for the inquiry did not relate to arguments for or against visits by nuclear armed or powered warships. They took as their starting point the fact that the visits took place. The Committee conducted its inquiry accordingly. The focus was one of ensuring, given that the visits occur, that adequate arrangements were in place to protect the public and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that no visits by nuclear powered warships have occurred since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference referred to vessels in Australian ports and waters, and so the Committee did not consider planning in relation to accidents on the high seas. The Committee confined its inquiry to visits that occur in peacetime, recognising that different considerations and arrangements might apply to wartime visits. </PARA>
<PARA> The only nuclear powered vessels that have visited Australia are those of the United States Navy. The inquiry concentrated on these vessels, and to a lesser extent those of the Royal Navy-which has approval to visit. The Committee did not regard as relevant the design characteristics, safety record, and so forth of Soviet nuclear powered ships, as these ships do not visit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Committee saw no need to inquire into the risks relating to inter-continental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, as vessels carrying these weapons do not visit. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference refer to `current' planning. Accordingly, for nuclear powered vessel visits, the Committee examined the history of planning and superseded plans only to the extent necessary to evaluate planning for ports that currently receive visits. These are Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Gage Roads off Fremantle, Cockburn Sound in Western Australia and Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that other ports, such as Adelaide, Melbourne or Sydney, do not receive nuclear powered ship visits and lack current plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry received 102 submissions, which have led to a 492-page report containing 39 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> It became apparent to the Committee during the course of its inquiry that there was a widespread lack of accurate information in the Australian community on the subject matter of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The restrictions imposed by official secrecy accounted to some extent for this. But there was much relevant information in the public domain in fragmentary form which many of those interested in the subject did not appear to be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Committee considered that it would be useful to document extensively the sources of information available and on which it relied. This, in part, accounts for the length of the report and the fact that it contains over 1300 footnotes. </PARA>
<PARA>Structure of the Report</PARA>
<PARA> Although a visiting vessel might be both nuclear powered and nuclear armed, the Committee considered that greater clarity is achieved by assessing the reactor and weapon risks separately. Accordingly chapters 3 to 10 of the report deal with nuclear powered ships; chapters 11 to 13 deal with nuclear weapons. However, the Committee used the same methodology in assessing the two types of risks. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's Methodology</PARA>
<PARA> An assessment of the adequacy of current planning has to be centred around the basic question: are the procedures sufficient to cope with the risks of accidents? Identification of the risks is thus an essential starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves assessing both the likelihood and consequences of various kinds of accidents. Much of the argument put to the Committee by those opposed to the present arrangements focused almost exclusively on the consequences of possible accidents. The Committee considered it essential to focus also on accident likelihood: there is little value in considering in detail the consequences of a possible accident whose likelihood can be shown to be very remote. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not conduct its own risk assessment from scratch. Rather, it reviewed in detail the assessments made by ANSTO and the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> In its review, the Committee evaluated two broad aspects: the historical safety record of naval reactors and naval nuclear weapons; and the ways in which possible accident scenarios might occur. In addition, the Committee had some regard to the existence or absence of contingency planning in other countries receiving visits. This provided a guide to how other countries have assessed the risks involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered that, despite the effect of military secrecy, enough information was available to enable it to make useful conclusions on both weapons and reactors. On some matters of detail not affecting its overall conclusions, the Committee has recommended that further information or assurances be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>NPWs-Safety Record</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that, despite extensive Australian monitoring conducted during each nuclear powered warship visit since 1976, no radiation release had ever been detected. The Committee noted the United States Navy's claim that it has accumulated over 3200 reactor-years of operation with its naval nuclear reactors `without a reactor accident or any radioactivity release having a significant environmental effect'. Of these 3200 reactor years, 2 have been in Australian ports (since 1980). </PARA>
<PARA> After a careful analysis of overseas and local research material, the Committee found no reason to doubt this United States Navy claim in the context of the type of visits made to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Some claims put to the Committee about the safety record of nuclear powered warships concerned accidents which could not occur during visits to Australian ports, such as the high seas accidents which involved the USS Thresher and the USS Scorpion; accidents to Soviet nuclear submarines (which do not visit Australia); or accidents during construction and maintenance at home-port dockyards. It was not necessary for the Committee to come to conclusions on the validity of these claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Those putting allegations to the Committee about United States naval reactor accidents seemed unaware that many specific allegations had been subject to detailed and persuasive rebuttal by the United States Navy. Also, there was often a failure to distinguish allegations which related to relatively trivial accidents involving discharge of wastes having minimal radioactive content, from more serious accidents. </PARA>
<PARA>NPWs-Possible Accidents Scenarios</PARA>
<PARA> It is conventional in accident contingency planning to establish a scenario that the plan is likely to have to cater for. The characteristics of this so-called `reference accident' provide the basis for planning. </PARA>
<PARA> A key factor in the Committee's examination of a reference accident is the knowledge that the reactors on visiting warships are within a containment structure. This is designed to allow, at most, only a slow and limited escape of radioactive materials to the environment should there be a serious accident-that is, a core melt-down accident. </PARA>
<PARA> Current Australian planning is based on an accident scenario in which the containment is effective; to use the jargon with which Committee members had to become familiar, the reference accident is a contained core melt-down. Many submissions argued that an uncontained accident should be used instead-that is, a more serious accident whose consequences would be spread over a significantly wider area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these arguments, the Committee evaluated the assessment made by ANSTO and the Department of Defence which led them to adopt a contained rather than an uncontained accident as the reference accident. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of this evaluation are set out in chapter 7 of the Committee's report. The analysis by ANSTO and Defence appeared to the Committee to have been thorough and detailed. </PARA>
<PARA> Constraints had been placed on the analysis due to lack of scientific certainty on some matters. Military secrecy resulted in a lack of information on others. However, the evidence supplied to the Committee indicated that on these matters safety-oriented assumptions had been made. Any inaccuracies created would be in the direction of over-stating the risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found no reason, after a careful and thorough analysis, to reject the use of the contained accident as the basis of planning. It evaluated the adequacy of current contingency plans on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA>NPWs-Overseas Planning</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that accident planning overseas was based on either something similar to the reference accident used by Australian planners or on a less serious accident. </PARA>
<PARA>NPWs-Recommendations Relating to Current Plans</PARA>
<PARA> By way of background to the Committee's recommendations, I draw the Senate's attention to some of the arrangements under which nuclear powered warships currently enter Australian ports:</PARA>
<PARA> - visits will not be for fuel handling or reactor repairs;</PARA>
<PARA> - vessel movements are restricted to daylight hours and conditions of good visibility;</PARA>
<PARA> - navigational controls on other shipping applies while nuclear powered vessels are entering or leaving; and</PARA>
<PARA> - radiation monitoring is conducted throughout the visit by Australian authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In general terms, the Committee found that the current plans displayed an attention to detail, both at the Commonwealth and at the State and Territory level. The Committee found no evidence that there was any lack of cooperation between the various governments that compromised the effectiveness of the plans. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee did find a number of deficiencies and matters that it considered required further attention. Among the recommendations made to deal with these, were:</PARA>
<PARA> - that no further nuclear powered warship (NPW) visits be made to Macquarie Wharves, Hobart or to any other berth where a major public hospital is within the zone which might require evacuation in the event of a reactor accident;</PARA>
<PARA> - that no NPWs visit approved berths at Port Adelaide or Townsville until they have been reassessed to ensure that changed land use near the berths has not affected visit safety;</PARA>
<PARA> - that no NPWs visit approved anchorages in Hobart and one in Darwin, or approved berths in Darwin and Brisbane, until evacuation arrangements are documented and in place;</PARA>
<PARA> - that a mechanism be created to ensure that changes to land use around approved berths, which might affect safety, be automatically notified to the Defence Department; and</PARA>
<PARA> - that plans be clarified to ensure that no hazardous cargo is handled in the vicinity of a visiting nuclear powered warship. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, detailed recommendations have been made for improvement or clarification of the plans with respect to provisions on matters such as:</PARA>
<PARA> - some aspects of the removal of a vessel, following an accident, from its berth or anchorage to a more remote location;</PARA>
<PARA> - post-accident radioactivity decontamination;</PARA>
<PARA> - the possible role of firefighters;</PARA>
<PARA> - post-accident provision of information to the media and the public; and</PARA>
<PARA> - keeping appropriate, accurate, long-term records of those exposed to contamination by radioactivity in the event of an accident. </PARA>
<PARA>NPWs-Dissemination of Information to the Public</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended measures to improve public awareness of, and access to, the documents which set out the current contingency arrangements, in particular that NPWs not be permitted to visit ports where the relevant safety plans are not publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this last recommendation, I might point out, Mr President, that the plans which were not publicly available when the Committee commenced its inquiry have now been released. I like to think that this happy result is due in no small part to the Committee's activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear Armed Warships</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I turn now to the question of planning for visits by ships that may be nuclear armed. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, there are no specific conditions applying to visits of vessels which might or might not be nuclear armed. Such vessels are subject only to ordinary navigational constraints. There are no specific safety plans relating to such visits. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive Australian Governments have concluded that specific safety plans are not required to deal with visits by vessels that may be nuclear armed. This conclusion rests primarily on the assessment that the likelihood of a nuclear weapon accident on a visiting warship is remote. A subsidiary reason is the existence of general port safety plans for dealing with shipping and hazardous cargo accidents, such as chemical or petroleum accidents, which could be used to deal with many aspects of the response to a nuclear weapon accident. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered whether specific plans were needed, and in doing so concentrated on the issue of potential accident likelihood, including mechanisms which would have to exist for accidents to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the two most serious potential accident risks were: nuclear detonation; and an accident in which the plutonium in a weapon was converted into an aerosol form able to be inhaled. The latter might occur if the weapon was engulfed in a fire, or if the conventional high explosive which forms part of the weapon's trigger mechanism exploded. Less serious accidents were also considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that the United States had assured the Australian Government that any weapons that might be on board a vessel would be securely and safely stowed in an unarmed condition during visits. The Committee accepted this assurance. It noted that the absence of any handling of weapons during occasional port visits to host countries sharply reduces the likelihood of accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also noted the safety features of ships' magazines, and the excellent safety record of these magazines when used to store conventional weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that United States nuclear weapons of more recent design have enhanced safety features compared with those designed in the 1950's and early 1960's. Although the older weapons are now being retired from deployment, the Committee based its conclusions on the risks relating to them, as well as the newer weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>NAWs-Safety Record</PARA>
<PARA> Many submissions alleged that the United States Navy had a very poor record on nuclear weapon safety. In considering this claim, the Committee noted that the United States Navy distinguishes nuclear weapon accidents from less serious incidents. The United States Navy has acknowledged that it has had 3 nuclear weapon accidents, the most recent in 1968. All involved the loss of intact weapons during operations, including flight operations, at sea-circumstances that are not relevant to those which arise during a vessel's visit to Australia. A careful check of overseas research material by the Committee gave it no reason to dispute the United States Navy's claimed record. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the three accidents, a large number of incidents-over 600 in the period 1965 to 1985-have been acknowledged. However, many of these incidents involved false alarms, dummy weapons used for training, and trivial events such as scratched paint or a bent fin on training weapon simulators or flat tyres on nuclear weapons carriers. It could be argued that the requirement to report such minor incidents indicates the tight procedures that surround nuclear weapons, rather than a poor safety record. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, very few of the 600 incidents could occur while weapons were in safe storage during a port visit, and those that could, for example, accidental flooding of a magazine, would not lead to a radiation hazard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was referred to a number of unofficial lists that have been published over the years of alleged United States Navy nuclear accidents. A further list was published in June 1989, after the Committee's report had been finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee's view, these lists have to be read critically for several reasons. They are based primarily on media reports of allegations, not all of which have been officially confirmed. They are generally not based on any definition of what constitutes a nuclear weapon accident. The lists tend to mix the potentially serious with the trivial. Moreover, they include incidents that did involve a nuclear weapons capable vessel, but which could not have posed a danger to any weapon that might have been on board. </PARA>
<PARA> The items in the lists have to be examined carefully to see what relevance they have to weapons held in secure storage during a port visit. Allegations relating to navies that do not visit Australia, or to accidents during weapons handling, maintenance, flight operations, and so forth, even if true, are not relevant to the risks faced during visits to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Committee considered that the known accident and incident records for naval nuclear weapons did not demonstrate a risk of sufficient magnitude to warrant contingency planning for occasional port visits. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument was put to the Committee that the records might be incomplete, due to military secrecy. The Committee considered that it was unlikely that the accidents of most interest to it-that is, during port visits and involving either nuclear detonation or plutonium aerosolisation-could have been successfully concealed from public notice. </PARA>
<PARA>NAWs-Possible Accident Scenarios</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the safety features in the design and storage of naval nuclear weapons are such that planning for the risk of accidental nuclear detonation is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, the Committee considered a wide range of accidents which could lead to plutonium dispersal from a weapon. However, after a lengthy analysis it could not find a credible scenario leading to such an accident: accident likelihood was sufficiently low that there was no need for contingency planning. </PARA>
<PARA> Other, less serious, accidents may have a greater likelihood. An example might be the sinking of a vessel with intact weapons on board. But accidents of this sort can be dealt with under the general port safety plans for maritime accidents. They do not require special contingency plans. </PARA>
<PARA>NAWs-Planning in other Countries</PARA>
<PARA> No national government overseas was identified during the inquiry which required specific nuclear weapon accident contingency plans for occasional visits by nuclear armed warships. </PARA>
<PARA>NAWs-Overall Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee recommended that work by the Department of Defence, referred to in Parliament last September, to document possible procedures for responding to a nuclear weapon accident should continue, and that the document should be publicly available when it has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee considered that the public interest would be assisted if information concerning current plans to deal with shipping and hazardous cargo accidents in ports was more widely available. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Committee recommended that the Commonwealth Government confirm that the State and Northern Territory Governments have adequate plans to deal with shipping accidents involving hazardous cargoes in their ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the Commonwealth should encourage the States and Northern Territory to make these plans public where this is not already the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that no dry-docking of nuclear weapons capable vessels be permitted unless either the vessel has been de-ammunitioned outside Australia or it can be guaranteed that the level of safety is at least as high as that for vessels berthed alongside a wharf, as is the normal practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Concluding Remarks</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank the other members of the present Committee for their diligence and persistence in bringing the inquiry to a successful conclusion, in particular for the many hours of careful consideration they gave to the final report. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to thank the staff and advisers of the Committee for their assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to take the opportunity to make a few comments about the report, as it has been tabled, and about the debate as it has unfolded following the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the visits to Australian ports by nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered vessels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The media reports about this report were generally speaking very good, comprehensive and thorough in dealing with the subject matter of the report, but a couple of major media outlets were in error when they reported the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the question of nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed vessels coming into Australian ports. For example, on 17 August last, one major newspaper said that there were, in fact, no recommendations in the report dealing with nuclear weapons, and, of course, that is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> As other members of the Committee in the chamber are aware, there are in fact three major recommendations in the report: recommendations Nos. 37, 38, and 39, which deal with the question of nuclear weapons on vessels which may be visiting Australian ports. In fact, one major newspaper not only said that the report had no recommendations about nuclear weapons but then in the very same article went on to quote one of the recommendations verbatim. So there was some confusion there. I think that the difficulty was that some of the journalists had trouble filing a copy on this particular report as it was tabled at a very awkward hour of the evening in relation to newspaper deadlines. </PARA>
<PARA> One television report also said the report contained no recommendations about nuclear weapons. The report probably intended to say that the Committee's report had nothing in it in regard to calling for specific plans about whether weapons were on board visiting ships in Australian ports. I would like to correct that. In fact, there are three recommendations in the report which deal with the question of nuclear weapons. There are quite good reasons why the Senate Standing Committee did not go down the road of recommending specific plans in relation to nuclear weapons accidents in respect of visiting warships. The first point to be borne in mind here is that after a very exhaustive and thorough investigation the Standing Committee could not find any other country which actually had specific plans for weapons accidents during casual port visits of the sort that occur at Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The second factor that we looked at in this regard was that the United States Navy, which is the principal force visiting our ports of course, has had no nuclear weapons accidents involving either detonation of a weapon or plutonium dispersal, two major forms of accident. None of those have occurred. The third factor engaging the Committee was that no credible scenarios were put forward by any witness who came before the Committee or in evidence to the Committee in which there could be a nuclear weapons accident in an Australian port. This was a matter which was not treated lightly. For example, there are three whole chapters in the report which deal with this question of nuclear weapons accidents. Chapters 11 to 13 outline a range of possible nuclear weapons accident scenarios. We looked at them comprehensively and in great detail. I must say that none of them stood up to examination. We looked at matters of fire, which might lead to plutonium dispersal; we looked at the possibility of ship collision in ports; we looked at the possibility of a reactor accident leading to nuclear weapons accident. None of these scenarios really stood up. After great analysis we could not come up with any credible scenario under which there could be a nuclear weapons accident in an Australian port. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the features of the Senate Standing Committee's report I believe is chapter 13, which is one of the most comprehensive analyses anywhere of the question of nuclear terrorism. I suggest that honourable senators when looking at the report make a point of looking at chapter 13 because there for the first time, I think, is a wide ranging and thorough analysis of this whole question of terrorism which might involve nuclear weapons. But, again, the Committee was not able to come up with any plausible scenario in an Australian context where terrorism could be seen to be at all likely. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was in my sick bed at home last week I happened to listen-much to my misfortune-to some of the debate that occurred last Wednesday. I heard the comments of Senator Sanders and Senator Vallentine and I thought that overall they were simply recycling the tired old arguments about the nuclear industry. They did not really advance the debate one iota with the sorts of comments that they made. For example, Senator Sanders kept on about totally hypothetical accident scenarios. He talked about the idea of fire creating a situation where plutonium could be dispersed. But clearly Senator Sanders had not read the report. He had not read the three chapters that deal with possible nuclear weapons accidents. The point that we make time and time again in that report is that we have to look at plausible causes of accidents and their risks. We cannot just look at consequences of accidents. We have to look at how they might occur and the actual risk of an accident's occurring. All Senator Sanders did, for example, was to talk about a fire and jump to a range of conclusions based on a fire. He did not say how it would occur or how likely it was. That is one of the things that have to be borne in mind in this whole debate about accidents, whether they be to reactors or to weapons. It is more important to look at the risk of an accident's occurring than just the consequences, which is one of the emotional ways of handling this very complex subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to point out that, as well as dealing with weapons accidents in great detail over three chapters and 110 pages, this report in total cites over 1,300 sources. It is a very thorough analysis indeed of nuclear ship visits of a casual nature to ports. Over 1,300 technical and other sources, both local and overseas, are cited in building up the report. As a result of that comprehensive detailing of the information that is available on this subject this report will be quite a valuable reference work.</PARA>
<PARA> I noticed very briefly also references last week to the 1975 collision between the USS John F. Kennedy and a vessel called the USS Belknap. For example, Senator Vallentine tried to use that collision to develop the argument that the United States would not tell us of an accident. I thought that was very interesting because I could not work out why the United States should have to tell other countries about such an accident anyway because it occurred many miles out to sea; in fact it was a high seas accident. There was no radiation leakage from that accident. I am not quite sure why that navy would have been required to tell other countries about that accident. Certainly Australia does not pretend to have jurisdiction over the high seas, and I am sure other countries do not either. The bottom line is that there was no radiation leak during that accident that has been documented. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also, in the context of talking about that accident, referred to a document called `Naval nuclear reactors'. I make the point again that there are a lot of irrelevancies brought forward in this debate about nuclear ships. For example, the collision that was talked about occurred at night. Senator Vallentine makes it very clear that it occurred at night. The fact is that nuclear-powered vessels coming into Australian ports are allowed to come in only in daylight hours. That is one of the conditions of entry. Nuclear-powered vessels can proceed into Australian ports only in daylight hours and when there is three-quarters of a mile visibility. So it is irrelevant to talk about night accidents in the context of this inquiry. Talk about accidents on the high seas is also irrelevant to this particular inquiry, which is about safety conditions relating to port visits. I noticed also that Senator Vallentine had a throwaway line in her speech about the Soviet navy but, of course, Soviet naval vessels are not invited to visit Australian ports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before this report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was tabled I expected that when I rose to speak on it I would proceed directly to kick the tripe out of my fellow Committee members. However, I feel a more pressing obligation to refer first to Mr Beazley's churlish and premature reaction to the Committee's report-a reaction apparently driven more by resentment that a Senate committee had interfered in his principality of defence than by even a cursory reading of the actual recommendations in the report. As Senator Teague pointed out last week, the recommendations are not onerous. He suggested that a couple of months would be needed to implement them. I suggest a wet weekend would do. But at least the Committee members put in the time to consider the many difficult and complex issues associated with naval nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. For political reasons the Committee applied a rubber stamp to the existing plans. But although I believe that Mr Beazley is quite well informed on the equipment that his forces deploy, I doubt that he knows very much about naval nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons. His American friends are unlikely to tell a Minister of a socialist government anything of substance. I also have good reason to doubt that he cares much about protecting the Australian public from nuclear accidents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one point that I should like to clarify about my dissent from the majority report. The Chairman of the Committee answered a press question by saying politely that he thought I had my own agenda, or words to that effect. It is true that I believe there are strong moral and practical reasons for excluding nuclear warships that are not related to accident safety, but, like the majority of the 102 submissions, in my dissent I address the terms of reference and the evidence or, one might well say, the lack of evidence. The Committee's unstated assumptions about its safety assessment were that a serious contaminating nuclear accident was unaccept- able and that Australia had independently to assess the accident risks to its citizens. Unfortunately, this task was beyond its competence. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing port safety plans are directed at visiting warships powered by naval nuclear reactors. These are all United States warships. Logically, the Committee wrote to the United States (US) Ambassador for information and got a brush-off. Two more letters asking about US safety plans went unanswered. Finally, 18 months later, the US Naval Attache at the Embassy informed not the Committee but the Department of Defence that no special safety plans were necessary. He also said that the US Navy would not assist in the preparation of safety plans, nor would it comment on plans developed without its assistance. So the official US opinion on Australian safety plans is that they are not necessary: all the monitoring and the contingency planning is a waste of time and, presumably, so is the work of the Committee. Although the inquiry was well advanced the Committee could have given up at this point. I take the fact that it did not to be a tacit acknowledgment that it could not place the safety of Australian citizens in the hands of a foreign power. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Kingdom (UK) authorities do think that safety plans for occasional visits of nuclear-powered warships are necessary and they provided the Committee with a copy of the publicly available Port of Liverpool safety plan. However, they would not, or could not, because of US licensing arrangements, release a document with some background information on naval nuclear reactors. This document is usually available to friendly institutions and is entitled, excitingly, `BR3019'. I believe that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) holds a copy but the Committee was not allowed to see it. Obviously, the Department of Defence and ANSTO have a special alliance relationship with these foreign powers, but the Senate, representing the people of Australia, does not. We have no naval nuclear reactors of our own. The larger of the two research reactors at Lucas Heights has some similarities to warship reactors but has many differences that we are aware of, and perhaps more that we know nothing of. The fact is that the details of these naval reactors are the subject of strict military secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to overstate the importance of military secrecy to the Committee's whole inquiry. Military secrecy not only serves to hide information from potential enemies; just as often it is used to conceal some of the more alarming potentials of military weapons from timid civilians. The stories surrounding the one megaton bomb dropped off the USS Ticonderoga illustrates the way in which the military hides and distorts the truth. The US Navy hides information about its nuclear reactors from all of us, especially Senate committees. It appears that it lies about them, too. In the Neptune 3 papers Arkin and Handler argue that Admiral Rickover lied to the US Congress about a reactor accident on the nuclear submarine USS Guardfish. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot discuss today the way in which the report misuses the civil reactor accident record; the way in which numbers like one in 104 reactor years creep into the safety assessment; or the way in which the Committee discounts the demonstrated inevitability of human error. I refer interested parties to my dissenting report. None of the Committee's sources, nor all of them together, provided a sufficient information base for the most rudimentary independent safety assessment. I find the hypothetical contained reference accident to be an arbitrary basis for accident planning. Accidents do not confine themselves to the quiet fizzle of the reference accident. They are bizarre and unpredictable by nature. Everyone agrees that the total inventory of fission products in the core of a naval reactor would make a very dangerous and unacceptable mess if it were to get out. The Committee claims to know that it cannot get out and discounts the several types of uncontained accident, even though the UK Liverpool plan makes some provision for an uncontained accident. Speaking of uncontained accidents, I should remind Senator Hamer that the Committee could not totally discount the melt-through accident referred to in Senator Vallentine's submission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has erected a paper screen of independent responsible action behind which it has meekly accepted the assurances of our principal ally that nothing bad will happen. The report's discussion of nuclear weapons accident risks used the same badly flawed methodology as the reactor argument. The Committee required a rattling good yarn as an accident scenario before it would even consider the consequences of a nuclear weapons accident. The Committee found most suggested accidents lacked the literary qualities it was looking for, including the detailed analysis of the effects of a plutonium contamination accident presented by Professor Jackson-Davis. I agree with Senator Hamer that his story may have been a bit weak on the details of exactly how the plutonium could be distributed, but we know that every visiting naval nuclear weapon is assembled with its explosive detonator. Even in the cases where it is a very stable explosive-or IHE-it is still capable of detonation in an accident, and we have evidence that a full explosion of the detonator can widely distribute the plutonium core as a respirable aerosol. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Davis evaluated the variables associated with the distribution of five kilograms of plutonium, or the contents of one weapon, over Sydney and predicted a maximum of about 11,000 casualties from plutonium induced cancers. Even if these figures are an over- estimate and it would be only 1,100, we are talking only about one nuclear device. All nuclear capable ships carry more than one weapon and United States Navy aircraft carriers carry about 100. There are eight conventionally powered United States aircraft carriers that could enter any Australian port and aircraft carriers have had some serious and instructive accidents, which I cannot go into now. </PARA>
<PARA> The accident aboard the USS Iowa was mentioned last week. I agree with Senator Hamer that there is a difference between naval operations and peacetime port visits, but the fact remains that the weapons are carried into our ports and, as I observed in my dissent, these ships are not festooned with safety systems because they are safe but because they are dangerous. Safety systems fail and human folly can always circumvent them. How many serious contaminating accidents can Australia afford? The answer is none. We cannot put these ships in the heart of our port cities and rely upon fallible human design and engineering to protect us from disaster, especially when there is no good reason for them to be there in the first place. Not only would a serious nuclear weapon contamination accident lead to many human fatalities but also it could render a large part of a city uninhabitable. The half-life of plutonium 239 is 24,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with this, politicians, with a half-life of about three years, are like summer insects. But Chernobyl will be remembered while human history endures and in a footnote will be the name of the Ukrainian Minister for Electrification who said that there would be less than one accident in ten thousand years of reactor operation. The members of the Committee have a similar hope of immortality in a footnote to the accident that killed an Australian city. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember the risk assessment by Defence Minister Beazley during the bicentennial warship visits. `There will be no accidents' he said. This was a gamble that paid off. There would have been a lot of egg dripping from the Beazley visage if it had not. However, imagine my surprise when soon after this statement was made I discovered that there was a draft safety plan for nuclear weapons accidents that had been prepared by the Visiting Ships Panel Nuclear (VSP[N]) within the Department of Defence. I actually saw this document on the desk of the head of Queensland Emergency Services. When the Committee asked Mr Beazley to see this plan the Minister refused-something that I still find amazing. I think I could be described as generous if I described the Minister's attitude towards the Committee as one of disdain. However, sight unseen, this accident plan had a major influence on the report. If honourable senators read the argument in the report on nuclear weapons accidents they will notice that it minimises the risk of a weapons accident. Yet right at the end, in chapter 11, paragraphs 115-117, there is a sudden change of heart and it is recommended that the VSP(N) plan be completed. </PARA>
<PARA> These paragraphs were added late in the preparation of the report but the sudden reversal still puzzled me until quite recently when I realised that it would have no real effect on the status quo. We have a pretend nuclear reactor plan, why not have a pretend weapons plan as well? Finally, the Committee's impressive list of safety promoting recommendations will not change anything; they are embroidery on the edges of a safety net with a giant hole in the middle. The only way to be truly safe is to keep these ships out of our harbours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, how could I not stand, having heard that speech? I really came in to speak about something else but Senator Dunn has provoked me into rising for a couple of moments because she made two references which I thought were compelling in their illogical presentation. The first related to Senator Vallentine's comments to the Committee. With the indulgence of the Senate, I will read from page 196 in chapter 7 of the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which details what Senator Vallentine told the Committee. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine told the Committee that, according to a 1973 United States Navy reactor disaster control plan, the `Navy found that the melt-down could go right down through the ship spilling hot radioactive materials to the bottom of the harbour . . .'. When the Committee tried to obtain a copy of the plan, it became clear that Senator Vallentine had not seen the plan she purported to quote from. She in fact was quoting from a booklet authored by a New York peace activist. It would seem that this author had not seen the plan either but was relying on an account in a Honolulu newspaper. The journalist who wrote this account did not purport to have seen the plan, but had interviewed one of its authors. The statement about the melt through is not presented in this account as part of the plan, but as the view of the interviewee, a former shift supervisor in the radiological controls section at Pearl Harbour naval base. The knowledge of reactor design possessed by the interviewee is not stated. The Committee did not regard it as prudent to rely on this source. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vallentine quoted that document as irrefutable evidence that if there were a meltdown of the nuclear reactor it would melt a hole through the bottom of the ship and the radioactive material would then plunge to the seabed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well have done. Senator Vallentine presented that as the truth, at first hand, without qualification and without caveat. Can we really wonder why these people are not taken seriously? I am reminded of the inquiry that I found myself involved in with respect to the Kakadu National Park. We were told by some crazy fringe lunatic group that mussels south of Ranger mine were infected by radium. Having tested the quality and the quantity of radium in these mussels that the Aboriginal community were eating with great gusto as a new-found diet, I inquired of the level of radium in mussels found north of the mine. In other words, was the mine discharging the radium? Surprise, surprise, we discovered that the readings were exactly the same. It was simply a background count that would have been found in the buffaloes or mussels or any other living species in Kakadu National Park because of the uranium province in the area. Yet we were given this propaganda by this crazy group that had frightened the Aboriginal community white with fear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then they went on to tell us that ponds one, two, three and four were potentially able to leak. When I inquired how, I was told it was because the buffaloes would break down the walls of the ponds. Anybody who has seen these ponds knows that at the top of the walls, on the outer rim, the edges will carry semitrailer trucks running in opposite directions. They have been engineered to last a thousand years at worst risk scenario. The buffaloes in Kakadu National Park were going to break down these ponds! That is the sort of evidence that we were given on the Committee, under oath, in front of the media, who faithfully and slavishly and lazily reported it. Perhaps that is the greatest sin of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing is that this radical peace group totally discredits the reasonable and decent people who purport to put forward a respectable point of view-one with which I entirely disagree but at least it is respectable. These people try to prop up their prejudices and their ideological bents by distortions and falsehoods and untruths. They seek to create hysteria; they seek to create a level of emotion, because without the emotion and the hysteria and the hype and the fear their arguments fail. Their facts will not stand up to close analytical scrutiny. Of course, with these people the truth is always the first casualty, and it is invariably discharged with reckless abandon. Sadly, and I do not say this about all the media, so often we find the media blindly aiding and abetting these people because of the very laziness of the journalists who unquestioningly are prepared to report these distortions as the truth because they are good beat-ups, because they are good headlines, because they are so outrageous and extravagant in their claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most indicting element of the hysteria and the dishonesty presented by these people is the effect upon the community. The great unwashed, who have got no other way of knowing what the truth is except to read the newspapers, are presented with this stuff in pristine form as if it were the truth, without balance and without explanation. We have all these young people running around in a depressed state because they believe the end of the earth is going to arrive or we are going to have a nuclear winter or some other devastation is going to be visited upon us. This propaganda comes from people who live on hype, hysteria, dishonesty and untruths. These same people, who kick the Yanks at every turn and who are thunderingly silent when it comes to condemnation of the Soviets, will, at the offer of a bribe of an American cap, go aboard these ships for a free lunch to be photographed next to the captain so that they can take the cap, a baseball bat and a photograph back to their kids. They wonder why, when they are given a briefing by the admiral of the fleet or the captain of the carrier, they are not told anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I was on one ship and Senator Vallentine said to the admiral, `Are you carrying a tomahawk sea launch missile?'. Can one really imagine the admiral saying, `Well, I'll take you into my confidence, Senator Vallentine. The truth is, that parked down the back of this ship we've got a big heap of them?'. And they wonder why, when Minister Beazley, a representative of the American Embassy or any other authority appears before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade they sit there mute. These people are going a long way to destroying the Senate committee system simply because nobody is prepared to disclose in-confidence information for fear that it will be repeated. There are certain senators who will not give a commitment that, if they are given in confidence information of a sensitive nature, they will not repeat it. Frankly, in some cases if they did give the undertaking I still would not believe them. The tragedy, as I say, is that it is damaging to the community, it is damaging to the fabric of society, and more particularly to wit, it is damaging to the parliamentary process and the committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard in passing Senator Sanders, and again today, Senator Dunn, talking about the accident on the Iowa. What the hell has the accident on the Iowa got to do with the porting of nuclear ships? Do they think they fire off those guns in the harbours for a birthday celebration? Of course they do not. Those ships are designed so that if they have an accident of the nature of the accident on the Iowa-it was set off deliberately by a suicidal sailor-the fire cannot spread. I assume that Senator Dunn has been on board those ships either as a tourist or as someone seeking to learn the truth. She would know if she had gone into one of those turrets that it is quite impossible for any discharge to get outside the turret. Yet we have these absurd stories, these absurd untruths. As I say, what is the relevance of a ship discharging its cannons 40 or 50 miles out to sea-they will throw a shell 25 miles-to the porting of nuclear armed ships? I ask you!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike Senator Crichton-Browne, I will try to be logical and inoffensive. I begin by reminding the Senate that we are discussing the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which is entitled Visits to Australia by Nuclear Powered and Armed Vessels: Contingency planning for the accidental release of ionising radiation. I read the title because I believe that the title cites the first contradiction and illogicality of this report. The report, in its very title, accepts the possibility of accidents and the need for contingency planning. Yet it proceeds to argue, according to what Senator Maguire has said earlier, that there is no need for contingency planning and that there is little or no possibility of an accident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am trying to be logical. Senator Crichton-Browne, I note, is not listening to this logic. Frankly, I am disappointed that the Senate committee process has produced a report which is substantial, which represents literally thousands of hours of genuine application to task, and yet which is fundamentally so flawed in its logic. I believe that there is an inherent contradiction on the very cover of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire very reasonably and very genuinely and sincerely argues his point and puts what is really a dichotomy to us. The dichotomy is: Are accidents possible or are they impossible? He has put in front of us the choice-this calamity is either not possible or is not likely. I do not believe that anybody here is really arguing that it is not possible. I do not thing that argument is one that we have to respond to. I think there is ample evidence and ample admission that clearly it is possible. So we are then confronted with the question of how likely it is. The answer may well be, very unlikely. In fact, the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has argued that it is extremely unlikely. But, in a letter to the Minister on 22 February 1989 I took up the question of the adequacy of the contingency plan specifically in relation to Brisbane, and I quote one paragraph from my letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Sir, I am bewildered also by the logic that relates the adequacy of a disaster contingency plan to the frequency of exposure to the potential danger. It is apparent that a plan to cater for potential danger has to be just as adequate whether the danger occurs once a year or once in five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Or once in fifty years. If there is any danger at all-and this report does not argue that there is no danger, it argues that it is not likely that that danger will lead to a calamity-quite obviously there is a need for contingency plans and quite obviously it is reasonable for people like Senator Vallentine and Senator Dunn, bearing in mind that the Australian Democrats have been saying this for 12 years, to be saying that we should start to ask whether it is sensible and sane to have these ships in our ports. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to the second sentence in this report, which says that the Committee takes as its starting point the fact that these visits take place. In other words, it does not address the fundamental question of whether or not this danger should even be brought here. </PARA>

I am sorry, but I am not accepting that this report is logical or infallible. It then in fact proceeds page after page, chapter after chapter, to address the very dangers which Senator Maguire was arguing earlier on are of no consequence at all. In fact, if we move on it cites the fact that visiting countries will not tell us whether the ships are nuclear armed or nuclear powered or not. There must be some reason why they will not tell us. There must be some reason why they withhold that information. It does not make sense, if there is no danger or it is not of consequence, not to tell us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report then goes on to say that it is very difficult to analyse these problems. Of course it is difficult. In fact we would argue that it is not even necessary if you do not have the damned danger in the first place. The fact that you have the difficulty of analysing the degree of danger and the complexity of contingency plans is in fact every reason for not allowing such vessels into our ports. If we do not allow them in, we do not have the danger, and we do not have the need for the contingency plan. The degree of difficulty associated with it, in fact, is irrelevant. This is what I consider to be logic. I do not consider what we heard from either Senator Maguire or Senator Crichton-Browne to be logic. We heard emotional outpourings which were often quite offensive. </PARA>

It considers in depth protective measures following accidents. Yet we are being told that there is no danger of such accidents. There is no logic in what is being advanced in the report and in the arguments in support of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The only logical conclusion that we can reach is that there will be no danger if we have no ships in our ports. That has always been the only logical position to take, particularly in an era in which, hopefully, we are moving into a more peaceful posture globally, in an era in which we are proving, in incident after incident, that nuclear accidents are possible. If honourable senators do not believe me, they should read the numerous examples that I quoted when we debated an urgency motion on 4 November 1988, associated with bringing nuclear ships into our harbours for the bicentennial celebrations. I gave example after example of nuclear accidents at sea, in the water. That water may well be the water of harbours. It may well be the water of Australia's harbours. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no logic in what is being put before this chamber today. I congratulate Senator Dunn on having the logic and the courage to produce a dissenting report, to argue it well, to argue it substantially, and to stand in this chamber and defend it. I believe that that is what Senate committees are about. I congratulate her on presenting that dissenting report. I identify our party with the dissenting report. I simply rebuff the sort of emotional, dramatic rubbish, illogical as it clearly was and is, that Senator Crichton-Browne delivered to the chamber in his contribution to the debate on an extremely important report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had been looking at the question of visits to Australia by nuclear powered or armed vessels for some time before I joined the Committee. My first reaction when I looked at the terms of reference, the length of time the Senate had already taken to consider it, the amount of progress that had been made and the amount of work which remained to be done, was to wonder whether it was worth doing at all. The Senate does not often enough consider the cost-benefit aspects of its own actions. I wondered whether this inquiry was to keep senators busy instead of an inquiry to serve a particular public purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I think we have now produced a substantial public document, a reference work-I suspect that if one takes into account the dissenting report as well, one will see that we have a reference work for both sides of the debate; I do not have any objection to that-and a substantial body of public information on the issue. That makes a contribution to public life. It raises the possibility of substantial tightening of procedures and arrangements surrounding visits by nuclear-powered vessels, particularly where the States have been noticeably slack. I refer in particular to Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern Territory. In those States there clearly has been a substantial and evident inadequacy of planning and it is appropriate that that be brought to attention. It should have been brought to attention in the normal course of parliamentary scrutiny in those States, but it was not. So to that extent the report raises useful new matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that the dissenting report was predictable and I suspect it was written and put in the bottom drawer before any of the evidence was presented. It is a legitimate point of view for people to hold about matters of foreign policy. It did not bear any relationship to the terms of reference of the inquiry, which was precluded from looking at those important foreign policy questions. There is a legitimate foreign policy debate there. I do not want to get involved with abusing people who have a different foreign policy view from me or from the Government. I do not think that is very helpful to the debate and it is a pity that it was injected into the debate; but nobody takes much notice of Senator Crichton-Browne, so I will not either. </PARA>
<PARA> The dissenting report was very predictable. What is wrong with it is that it fails to take into account the consequences of its actions. What we have to face up to is that it may be that as a matter of foreign policy people do not wish to see any such visits. That is, as I say, a legitimate foreign policy view which I do not share. However, I think what we have to do, and what our mandate was, is deal with what should be done while these visits continue. For example, what should be done about the totally inadequate situation in Hobart, where the Tasmanian Government approved plans which had within the zone that needed to be evacuated in the event of any problem the Hobart public hospital? Those sorts of issues warrant serious consideration and the Committee did the appropriate thing in considering them. It is a pity that the dissenting report does not. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the comments made by others, in particular by the Chairman, in congratulating the staff of the Committee, who did an enormously difficult job very well in presenting this comprehensive report. I thank the consultants who assisted the Committee in areas concerned with the scientific validity of the material put forward where we needed substantial advice and received it. It is an issue in which emotions tend to cloud judgment, and they did for many people who came before us. They were people of goodwill, people with a substantial desire to improve the world and Australia in particular, but they were not always able to support the level of their enthusiasm with the quality of their argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was not presented with the option of opting out of decisions, nor were we given the brief of making surrogate foreign policy decisions. We had a brief to consider, given that there are visits to Australia by nuclear powered and nuclear armed vessels, what are the best arrangements that can be made adequately to cope with that. The recommendations should lead, if accepted, to some significant tightening of the arrangements concerning such visits. For example, with regard to land use planning, and I refer particularly there to Port Adelaide and Townsville, we had a silly situation in respect of one very simple mechanism concerning town plans in areas affected by the 1.5 kilometre zone. There was no notation on those town plans requiring Defence or the port authority to be advised of any planning changes in such areas so that they could ensure that the safety arrangements set in place at any one time continued to operate. The Committee has recommended that that should take place and I hope that that simple cost-free recommendation is taken up. There are not many cost-free recommendations around. </PARA>
<PARA> There are significant recommendations for enhancement of the provision of information to the public. There are, as I said earlier, the important recommendations relating to Hobart and particularly the Macquarie wharves. The situation in Hobart required attention and I am pleased that it received it. Some other legitimate concerns, for example, those of the civilian firefighters, it seemed to me had been fudged until now. Either they should be told they have no role or they should be trained for the role they have. They are left in the unsatisfactory position of uncertainty. They are entitled to have that situation clarified. The recommendations, if adopted, would provide that clarification. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take a lot of time in this debate and, of course, I do not have the opportunity to do so because there is only 10 minutes available. I will make a brief reference to the question of nuclear weapon accidents. I do not have the time to deal with the issue in great substance but the Chairman dealt with it very adequately. We are not recommending similar special contingency plans there but the Committee does acknowledge a genuine community concern about that matter. I guess `plan' is perhaps too grand a title. But there is the need for an explanatory document. The Committee's support for the continuing development of that explanatory document is appropriate and consistent with the principle of the provision of greater public information which runs right through the report. It permeates the report as it should. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available I will draw some conclusions. Having raised at the start the question of a cost-benefit assessment of this inquiry, it does provide a benefit in terms of its assessment of matters that have not been assessed before, the provision of information that was not otherwise available and the codification and bringing together of information that was available but not readily accessible to ordinary Australians. It does make, therefore, a direct contribution to the publicly available knowledge and should make two other contributions: firstly, by the debate that it generates and the publicity that has flowed and, secondly, indirectly, by the extent to which the recommendations concerning the public provision of information are accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Some useful tightening of the arrangements should eventuate if the recommendations of the Committee are adopted. But, as I have said before, our brief was not to provide a surrogate foreign policy. We were not asked to do that. Despite the narrow framework with which we were confronted, I believe the report does make a useful contribution to public debate. It will confront many closed minds and it will be dealt with within a legitimate debate over foreign policy. Disregarding that, safety planning will be enhanced to the extent that the Federal Government responds positively and the slack State governments lift their game. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The headquarters of which, as Senator Bishop says, are in Bondi-they are not even New Zealanders. I think it worth noting that the Auditor-General does express concern on a couple of scores. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Auditor-General's review of research projects undertaken by the Institute, instances were noted where it was not possible to verify satisfactorily the submission, consideration and, where applicable, approval of research projects because of inadequacies in the formal documentation of these projects. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that all scientists would take the view that accountants are a pain in the neck, that they continually intervene and require things to be put on paper, but I remind the Office of the Supervising Scientist that public money is being spent. There is a requirement and an obligation for proper records of these things to be kept. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to say that the Supervising Scientist is advised orally of new research projects during his visits to the Institute. I agree with the Auditor-General that, given his overall responsibilities, the Supervising Scientist should be formally advised of all new research projects and that guidelines should be formalised which address the need for adequate documentation of decisions made in relation to the status of research projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The consideration of the merits of various proposed research projects should also be adequately documented. When there are multi-millions of dollars involved it is not good enough for a group of scientists to sit around and say, `Okay, we'll do this', without having to establish on a bit of paper why they are doing it and whether it is money well spent. It was noted by the Auditor-General that no register of consultants was maintained to document the organisations and individuals with expertise in areas of research relevant to the functions and objectives of the OSS. While I acknowledge that the Office of the Supervising Scientist advised that it considers that documenting all decisions relevant to the approval of research projects can become too bureaucratic and time-consuming, with no real gain in accountability, it does intend to do something about this, and not before time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General also observed some instances of long delays between the completion of research and, where a decision to publish the results was made, publication of the results. There is no doubt, and I agree with the Auditor-General, that prompt publication would enhance the credibility of the research undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist and that action should be taken by it to reduce delays in the publication process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the House of Representatives, while supporting the legislation, the Opposition divided the House on the questions of the application of this Bill to people who separate and have children born before its commencement and on the date on which liability under the formula would commence. Since the debate in the House there have been very productive discussions between the Government and the Opposition. This statement is designed to accommodate the concerns raised by the Opposition. The Government has also held productive discussions with the Australian Democrats. Those discussions have resulted in agreement between the parties on the Bill before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government indicates that we will accept the amendment circulated by the Opposition. It meets the concerns of both the Government and the Opposition expressed in the House of Representatives on the question of the date of commencement of liability. The Government has established the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group to oversee the evaluation of stage 2 of the child support scheme. The members of the group are: the Honourable Justice Fogarty, senior judge, Family Court of Australia, Convener; Mr Des Black, retired Second Commissioner of Taxation; Ms Diana Bryant, senior partner, Phillips Fox, solicitors; and Ms Merle Mitchell, Vice-President, Australian Council of Social Service. The group will monitor and advise on the implementation and evaluation of the child support scheme from commencement of stage 2 of the scheme. It will subsume the monitoring function of the Child Support Consultative Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has agreed not to proceed with the amendments it moved in the House in relation to the limitation of the application of the Bill to people who separate or have a child born on or after commencement of the Bill. To meet the concerns of the Opposition on this issue it has been agreed in discussions between the Government and Opposition that the priority task for the new Child Support Evaluation Consultative Group will be to examine the effect of excluding from assessment under the proposed Child Support (Assessment) Act those persons who separated before 1 October 1989 and do not have a child born on or after that date. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the group will: monitor the level of orders being made by, or registered with, the courts for the maintenance of those children excluded from the assessment process; compare maintenance levels set by, or registered with, the courts with the level of support obtainable under the formula in comparable circumstances; and monitor procedures to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) maximise the coverage of child support received by the sole parent pensioner population; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ensure that the level of child support received by sole parent pensioners is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA>The group will be required to report on these matters by 31 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear equity argument pursued with vigour by the Opposition and accepted by the Government-that it is desirable for all children of separated parents to have equal access to fair, secure and regular child support. The legislation before the Senate effects substantial changes in the ways in which very sensitive issues are resolved. It implements a new system of administrative assessment by requiring the application of a formula to determine the appropriate level of child support. But it applies only to children of parents who separate or have a child born on or after its commencement. This limitation means children not covered by the Bill would continue to have their child support entitlements assessed under the Family Law Act. The Department of Social Security provides to sole parent pensioners a form to assist them to obtain an enforceable agreement for child support under the Family Law Act and comprehensive referral information to assist them to proceed to court where this is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Under recent amendments to the family law rules procedures for obtaining orders under the Family Law Act have been substantially simplified. Under these procedures it should be easier for those who do not negotiate agreements to apply for an order which could result in payment in accordance with the formula used in those cases to which administrative assessment applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group will provide advice on whether these mechanisms result in any inequity as between children covered by administrative assessment and those not covered by administrative assessment in comparable circumstances and on the coverage of the existing sole parent pensioner population. The Government undertakes to publish that advice as soon as it is received and to table it in both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes the support of the Opposition and Australian Democrats for this most important reform. It is a credit to the Parliament that we are able to legislate to overcome one of the greatest inequities in Australian society with such a unity of purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is supporting the Child Support (Assessment) Bill 1989, as the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has said, subject to the amendment which I will move in the committee stage and subject to the statement which the Minister has just made. The Opposition has been concerned for a long time that there is gross inequity to children who suffer when their parents separate. This Bill, in fact, starts to send messages that indeed the Government of Australia and the Opposition in Australia are serious that people who bring children into the world have an on-going and permanent responsibility to bring those children up in a reasonable way to meet the normal expectations they would have had had their parents not so separated. This is but stage two of a package which the Government has initiated, the first one being to provide for the registration, collection and enforcement of court orders for maintenance by the Child Support Agency which is controlled by the Commissioner of Taxation. The Opposition supports this package because it is consistent with our own policy and, indeed, goes back to the position taken by the Ruddock report in 1980. The concerns about unfairness and lack of equity have been with the Opposition for a considerable time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The development of the formula which is outlined in the Bill is complicated but it means that there will be a degree of certainty about how much will be paid by a non-custodial parent towards the maintenance of the children that he or she has brought into this world and has an on-going responsibility for. In the debate in the House of Representatives it was pointed out by Mr Wilson that it will assist in alleviating child poverty, and that approximately 500,000 children are living in poverty. So much for the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that there would be none left in 1990. The really sad thing is that the majority of these children are the children of so-called sole parents, although that term does worry me somewhat because no child actually comes into this world with a sole parent. It takes two people to bring any child into this world and, unfortunately, under the law as it has been presently, it has been possible for one parent simply to abrogate the responsibility he or she has towards the children that they, together, brought into the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that of those children 60 per cent are living in poverty as a result of being left with a so-called sole parent who has been deserted or divorced. Very often when we hear the debate about the size of the pension bill for sole parent benefits, we hear the allegation that all sole parents are unmarried mothers who have brought children into the world, outside wedlock, and therefore the Government is saddled with the burden. This is simply not true. The majority of people who are in receipt of the sole parent benefit are mothers who have been deserted by the father of their children who has left the State, the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for bringing those children through education and into adulthood. This is clearly not acceptable. The thing that is saddening is that it has taken us this long to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement which the Minister read he spoke of the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group which is chaired by Justice Fogarty of the Family Court. It was with some anguish that the Opposition agreed not to pursue the further amendment which would have brought within the ambit of this change children of separated parents where the separation took place prior to 1 October 1989 and where the child came into being before 1 October 1989, because it is felt that those children will be disadvantaged. We accept the good faith of the Government that it will charge this evaluation advisory group with the task of monitoring the awards which are made and any fresh applications which are made for alterations in maintenance. If injustice remains by 1990, when the committee is to report, we look forward to further action being taken. A very significant paragraph in the statement that the Minister read is on page 2 and it reads this way:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear equity argument pursued with vigour by the Opposition and accepted by the Government. That is that it is desirable for all children of separated parents to have equal access to fair, secure and regular child support. </PARA>
<PARA>Too many times, many members and senators would become aware of constituents who come to visit them with great plight where the withdrawal of one parent from the family unit has meant that the whole lifestyle and expectation of life of the children of that family has altered. Clearly, the unilateral abrogation of responsibility of one parent towards children that have been jointly brought into the world is no longer acceptable, and that is the very strong message that comes through from the enacting of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back to the Child Support Consultative Group, I think a statement which it made with regard to the establishment of the formula and why the formula was recommended is significant and is worth quoting. It took a view about the formula, which I have said is reasonably complicated. It is the child support percentage which is laid out in the proposed section 38 of the Bill, times the adjusted income amount, which is further defined in the Bill, which results from the child support income amount less the exempted income amount. All that that really means is that the non-custodial parent is entitled to have support to maintain his or her own needs, but there is a table of child support percentages which are set out in the Act which simply says that if you have one, two, three, four or five or more children, then a certain percentage of the child support income amount, less the exempted income amount, will be paid for maintenance of those children. But to go back to the reason for that formula being arrived at, the group said that:</PARA>
<PARA>The formula should seek to approximate the situation where parents live together, by guaranteeing the child an appropriate share in his or her parents' income. </PARA>
<PARA>That is saying very succinctly that there is an expectation as a result of this legislation, that indeed a child's expectation having been born into a family is not to be diminished by the unilateral and, indeed, very often irresponsible, departure of one parent from that situation which hitherto has meant that the taxpayer has picked up the tab. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, though, to realise that the formula is not mandatory. It is possible to reach an agreement between parents as to the proper maintenance of those children, and the Opposition is supportive of that. Indeed, where there is a case to be made for a departure from that formula, then this matter can be dealt with by the court. So the application of the formula will not be harsh and unconscionable, but there is provision to make sure that its application brings about a fair adjustment. It is also important to realise that there is a limit on the amount of income that may be taken into account, and again that is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to say that we support this Bill because it is consistent with our own policies with regard to a fair shake of the stick for kids who, through no fault of their own, find that their expectations in life have been diminished because of the laws of the land and the signals that were sent out by governments previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important statistic is worth repeating. I know it was dealt with in the lower House, but it is important to put it on the record here. Prior to the introduction of stage one, which established the Child Support Agency, 70 per cent of non-custodial parents were not paying any maintenance at all for their children. That is clearly outrageous. We have been living in a society where we have condoned the irresponsible behaviour of parents towards their children. When we look at reports on homeless youth, again we see that children have become homeless because of splits in their family. There has been no satisfactory way of ensuring that they have an equitable share in the expectation that their parents originally brought them up to have. </PARA>
<PARA> Of those custodial parents who had enforceable liabilities in the form of maintenance orders, 70 per cent were not receiving any maintenance. Court orders were simply ignored by many non-custodial parents because the business of trying to enforce the order was just too painful and too difficult. There has been an improvement since the introduction of stage one and, indeed, there was the solid lobby group that argued that stage one ought to be monitored further and that stage two ought to be delayed for some time. It was the joint view of the Government and the Opposition that this was not a suitable way to go; that the need for stage two to be introduced was far too great and it was timely for it to be introduced now. As I have said, the operation date for this legislation is 1 October and although, as I mentioned earlier, we had originally said that we would like all children who were children of separated parents to have access to this new formula, we have agreed with the Government, in light of the statement that has been made, to withdraw that amendment on the undertaking that the matter will be monitored. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the level of payments under the formula, those forced to pay will always complain. There are parents who are separated and who do in fact meet all the obligations that a parent ought to meet. There are parents who take a responsible attitude when their marriages break and they maintain the responsibility that they have to families that they have created. But unfortunately they are in the minority. When stage 1 was introduced there were many who felt they were hardly done by because, in good faith, they had maintained their families in a way in which they were able to do and which was fair and just, but because so many had abused the system it was necessary to legislate to change the basic rules. That is exactly the case with stage two. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite unacceptable for the community to pay, in the form of higher taxes, for the funding of so-called discretionary parents. The fact of the matter is that, if people bring children into this world in this society, they have an ongoing responsibility to bring those children up, to make them good citizens, to give them good education and to make them proud Australians. It is simply no longer acceptable to say, `I think I have had enough, I am going off to have a better time and the state can pick up the tab'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped, I believe, that the sense of despair that many Australian children have had, those same children who live in poverty, will be relieved and they will have a better chance under this legislation. It certainly is the intent of the Opposition in giving support to the Bill that what will result is a fairer and a better life for Australian children who will then grow up to be better Australians and in turn create their own families which have a better chance of being stable. </PARA>

I want first of all to congratulate the Government on proceeding through all the stages that it has had to go through to get to this, I guess, final stage in the child support legislation package. We have to acknowledge that it is the political will of this Government that has carried that through. While I take the point raised by Senator Bishop that this is not something entirely of the Government's making, and certainly the Opposition in times past has had inquiries and tried to tackle the issue, I think it is a matter of record that it was the political will of this Government that saw it through to the very important, significant and appropriate legislation we are introducing tonight. It is important to acknowledge the significance of bipartisan support for this legislation, and I would second Senator Bishop's comments about that. As I have just said, it is not as though it is a novel issue for the Opposition. It is something that it has looked at in times past. I think the sentiment conveyed by this legislation does enjoy bipartisan support, and Senator Bishop has said that very succinctly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important to note that not only do we have bipartisan political support but also, as was said in the second reading speech, this child support scheme has brought about a unique display of unity of purpose amongst all legislators in Australia. Legislation for stage one of the child support scheme passed through both Houses of this Parliament with unanimous support and its full operation has depended upon legislation passed by the parliaments of all six States. Hopefully, that will continue to the second stage with the appropriate reference of powers from our State parliaments. It is very significant to have that bipartisan support across political parties and the achievement of unanimity of purpose amongst the different legislatures in this country is unique. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation clearly gives recognition to the responsibility of parents to support their children through to adulthood, whether they live with them or not. We have to appreciate that it is part of the Government's comprehensive policies to ensure the rights of our children-rights to income, to housing, to health care, to education, to sport and recreation, to any of the things we regard as appropriate for our children. It is part of our Government's concern that our children are assisted out of poverty, and that fits very appropriately and appositely with the other changes introduced by this Government in terms of increases in family allowance, the very significant family allowance supplement, the establishment of benchmarks for a suitable level of payment on behalf of children, and the indexation of those payments so that never again will they fall behind what are the appropriate levels now set. That is also, associated with the increase in pensions and the recognition by government that it is the appropriate income for families, particularly that provided to the parent, that is going to best assist the children. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as I have just said, income alone is not sufficient to assist people out of poverty. Our children need to have access to health care, to education, and so on. Our children also need to know, and I think this is enshrined in this legislation, that their parents will provide for them, that their parents will be encouraged to fulfil their obligations. That is not something that will assist only the children; I believe it will also assist the parents, and I will come to that in a slightly different way in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It also should be said that this legislation recognises another policy of this Government, and that is to manage government expenditure in a proper and responsible way. The expenditure is targeted to those in need; it is not being paid to people who have the capacity to care for themselves in part or in whole. Stage two of the legislation will within three years be saving government expenditure of something like $160m. That is all part of the comprehensive approach by government, particularly in the areas of this legislation, not only to provide for the people in the community but also to provide that it is properly done, responsibly done and efficiently done by the departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bishop made the point that prior to this legislation some 30 per cent of parents were paying maintenance. Since the introduction of stage one, and I guess that is a very short time, that has changed to 70 per cent of parents paying maintenance. I think that is really a remarkable turn around and, I think, it has been done with the minimum of odium in the community. There has been very little significant outcry or backlash against that kind of requirement on parents. It is a splendid example of the comprehensive approach of this Government in addressing those issues. It has involved close working, too, between the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office, and it has involved comprehensive legislative changes under social security legislation, family law legislation and tax legislation. In fact, it probably needs to be written up as a monument to something, but I think we should start writing right now. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) should perhaps convey to those people involved that that should be written. I am very pleased to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). I place on record our appreciation of his very significant role in getting to this point so effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of this package includes a campaign to ensure that people know their rights under these changes. That campaign will be addressed to parents, people in the relevant departments, employers, the legal profession, accountants, and so on. Even that small campaign is another example of how this legislation is very comprehensively addressing all the bits and pieces that are sometimes not addressed and which therefore may lead to a less than optimal outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation addresses the rights of children and, if not the rights of parents, certainly, firstly, the needs of parents to fulfil their obligations towards their children, secondly, the needs of parents not to be forced into poverty and, thirdly, the need to recognise that custodial parents, usually mothers, have been in times past pushed into poverty. This legislation will go a long way towards assisting those families by providing a regular and known income to enable families to budget, to manage, to address all those questions that are much better able to be addressed if one has the idea of the amount of money and that it is guaranteed to continue to come to one. It reflects a significant turnaround in attitudes in our society. Parents have an obligation. With this legislation they are assisted to fulfil it rather than encouraged to evade it. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is prospective. This has been touched on by both the Minister and Senator Bishop. There is the difficulty of balancing-as the honourable senator read from the Minister's speech-the clear equity argument that it is desirable for all children of separated parents to have equal access to fair, secure and regular child support against the reasonable expectation of people coming into separation or divorce to be clear about their obligations and not have an element of retrospectivity about that that might cause agitation for parents. Hopefully, with the procedure to review, monitor and check what payments are being made for children under the stage one process, balanced against the introduction of stage two, I think we have the best outcome, given that lively tension, as they say. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation provides a number of other things. One that is very important is that it preserves the right for couples to apply to the courts if they are in any way dissatisfied or seek changes in the provisions they might have arrived at. I have said, and I will say again, that I think the Bill addresses very thoroughly the complexities of the issues. It appreciates the variety of people's circumstances and it addresses issues of privacy of individuals balanced against the right of others to adequate and fair income and what is needed to be known so as to arrive at that formula. </PARA>
<PARA> One final point I want to make concerns something that arose regarding counsel advice to the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on this legislation. It was drawn to our attention that the original draft had proposed for us the concept of half a child. I thought that, if not this Parliament, certainly Solomon would have been quite perturbed to have to address legislation provoking us to comprehend the notion of half a child. I am pleased to acknowledge the change to the legislation, even just to the wording. We knew what the sentiment was, but I do not think we could settle for the concept of half a child. It is the liability and the parental responsibility that has to be halved, quartered or multiplied by, not the child. I acknowledge the assistance to change those words and to ensure that we do not ever put the concept of half a child into our legislation. It is a very significant occasion and it is satisfying for me to stand in this place in support of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my remarks to the Child Support (Assessment) Bill 1989 on behalf of the Australian Democrats. This Bill is designed to implement the second stage of the child support scheme announced by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in March 1987. The Child Support Act which came into effect on 1 June 1988 implemented the first part of the scheme. It provided for the registration, collection and enforcement of court orders for maintenance by the Child Support Agency which is controlled by the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, a range of problems existed under the previous arrangements, not the least of these being the low levels of maintenance paid and the contribution this made to child poverty and to high levels of taxation. Prior to the introduction of stage one, for example, court orders were frequently ignored by the non-custodial parent whereas, since the implementation of stage one, the record has improved. In social security terms the proportion of `sole parent' beneficiaries receiving maintenance has increased from 24 per cent to 34 per cent. Nevertheless there is still a long way to go before the cost of maintaining is properly distributed. The assessment procedures now coming into place are designed to alleviate existing problems and the formula seeks to simplify the present complex procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the details of the Bill, it provides for administrative assessment of child support by the Registrar of Child Support. It sets out the eligibility criteria which will enable a custodian to claim administrative assessment from a parent of the child. It sets out the formula which will determine the level of child support to be paid by a parent who is no longer living with the child and which takes into account different income levels of each parent. It gives courts with jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 jurisdiction to hear applications relating to eligibility for administrative assessment of child support. Also it allows courts to review wrong assessments and to hear applications for departure from assessment according to the formula in certain circumstances. The development of the formula contained in this legislation emerged from the deliberation of the child support consultative group. Very properly the group took the approach that the formula should seek to approximate the situation where the parents live together by guaranteeing the child an appropriate share of his or her parent's income. In simple terms, the formula works by taking the non-custodial parent's income, reducing it by a self-support component and dividing the remainder by a relevant percentage ranging from 18 per cent to 36 per cent, depending on the number of children. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indicated, there is provision for certain matters to be referred to a court, including cases where departure from the formula is sought and the court finds grounds to justify that variation. The aim of the legislation is both to bring maintenance payments to realistic levels and to ease the burden on the social security system. The determination of appropriate levels has been arrived at by reference to numerous studies examining the costs of children, particularly studies undertaken by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. In passing, I would like to pay tribute to the invaluable work undertaken over the years by the Australian Institute of Family Studies and to acknowledge the extent to which an understanding of all aspects of family life in Australia has been enhanced by the material the Australian Institute of Family Studies has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the legislation, the formula is to apply from 1 October so that any couples who separate or have a child born after that date are covered by the legislation. It is also worth noting that this Bill is the result of an extensive process of public consultation, a process of particular importance on such a sensitive issue as this. In fact, over 500 formal submissions were received during the process leading to the formulation of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from commending the way in which the legislation has been formulated, the Australian Democrats are happy to support its content. This legislation is about both the community's and a parent's primary duty to maintain children. It is about ensuring that those children are maintained at adequate levels and that obligations are met where they should be met. The approach it takes is fair and flexible and it seems to us that in bread and butter terms the very worthy objectives of the Bill will be met by its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is pleasing to note the cooperative approach that has been taken in relation to this Bill. The issue is not without its problems. But it is about the well-being of our children and deserves a bipartisan, or perhaps I should say tripartisan, approach. The Australian Democrats are pleased to be part of that and to support the Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worthwhile, in discussing this Child Support (Assessment) Bill, to have a look back at what has occurred over the years since the Family Law Act came into being and was first used in 1976. This certainly was referred to by the Joint Committee on the Family Law Act, the Ruddock Committee, which reported in 1980 with a most comprehensive review of the Act during its early years. That Committee indicated that arrangements needed to be made to change the collection of maintenance so that parents would support to a much greater extent the children that they had brought into the world and not leave the job to, frequently, of course, other parents and other taxpayers through the tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are talking about are the arrangements whereby a non-custodial parent contributes to the cost of children in the custody of the other parent. Over the years that payment has been made in a number of ways, frequently by a regular cash payment or by cash and other means, such as by paying for medical benefits coverage-this was the case at one time-school fees, clothing and a whole range of items. Frequently maintenance was all wrapped up in a property settlement and the custodial parent then sought to supplement the cash income from the social security arrangements that existed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that that developed to a very fine degree as a consequence of the interpretation of one particular section of the original Act. Sections 74 and 75 dealt with the matter of child maintenance, but it was 75 (f) which in particular I believe contributed to the development that needed to be dealt with, and I believe is being dealt with in this legislation-that is, the court should take into account, when assessing the maintenance paid by a non-custodial parent to the custodial parent, any pension or other entitlement that the person might have. So for many years after it was determined that social security was one such item, the amount of maintenance that was paid under court orders was at the very minimum that would enable the custodial parent to get the absolute maximum benefit out of the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view things went wrong in this respect right from the start. Of course, there is never only one answer to any problem, but I believe that was a significant problem that probably was not intended. We have finished up with a situation in which, until recently, up to 70 per cent of children were not benefiting from a contribution from a non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not overlook the fact that quite a large number of voluntary agreements have been satisfactory. Some agreements that perhaps came under the category of voluntary were not so in many respects. We have to take into account the cost of court proceedings when we assess whether some of them were really voluntary or not. Many orders have been made by the court and adjudicated upon using the criteria that were in the original Act and which are still there. One significant fact is that in the future maintenance will be assessed, on the one hand, by the court using criteria which have been laid down for some time and, on the other hand, under this legislation, by an administrative assessment which in no way takes into account these factors. This is one of the matters which I hope the Minister will ask the advisory group which he referred to earlier to look at as time passes to see whether there are significant differences. </PARA>
<PARA> The factors which the court is required to take into account are income; earning capacity; property; the financial resources of the child; the manner in which the child is being, and in which the parents expect the child to be, educated or trained; any special needs of the child; the capacity of the child to earn or to derive income; income earning capacity; the property and financial resources of the parties; the commitments of the parties that are necessary to enable them to support themselves; the direct and indirect costs incurred by the parent or other person who has the custody of the child; and other special circumstances. None of these is taken into account in the formula. It may not be significant in the slightest but it may well be, and I believe it is an additional aspect of the whole matter that the advisory group ought to have referred to it when reporting back on the operation of the second stage of the Government's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect of the whole development of the Government's new proposals. Stage one, as has been referred to, I think, by all of the previous speakers, has resulted in significantly increased numbers of non-custodial parents contributing to the support of their children, as should be so, through the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security. In a number of instances there have been difficulties in parents getting the money under that arrangement. I hope that those difficulties will discontinue but there have been problems for some parents. I say to the Minister that the Government needs to monitor the situation most carefully to ensure that it is providing sufficiently adequate resources to enable this administrative arrangement for the assessment, collection and payment of maintenance to allow the money to get to the parent who needs it at the right time. I will not bore honourable senators tonight in going through some of the stories that I have heard, to which I have referred previously, of delays which have occurred. A parent who needs the money certainly needs it and it is the children who suffer if it does not come in. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is quite clear that many more are paying, unless the money gets to the parent we are not really doing the custodial parent any favour at all. I urge the Government most strongly to see that adequate resources are given to the Taxation Office to do the job it is now required to do. In addition, as always, adequate resources should be given to the Family Court in the areas that it is still involved in. They are many and varied and I believe that that Court is not adequately resourced to achieve the outcomes that the Government is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage is the operation of the formula which has been referred to. I do not think it is necessary to go into it in detail tonight. We talk frequently about the number of children living in poverty as a consequence of breakdown of marriage and lack of adequate support being paid to the custodial parent. I think we need also to monitor the operation of this formula to make quite certain that where there is adequate money to support the children it is not used to assist a non-custodial parent to pay less than he or she might otherwise have done by some other means. One has again to take into account the cost for a custodial parent of going to the Court for an order where that parent feels that the present arrangement is not adequate. That parent may well feel that he or she has to accept what is being offered in the light of the costs involved. The whole operation needs to be monitored to make sure that at one end of the scale this scheme is not used to enable people to pay less. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the article of Ian Scott, a specialist assistant at the Australian Institute of Family Studies. His article, entitled `The Child Maintenance Formula and the Costs of Children', is in the August 1989 issue, issue No. 24, of Family Matters, produced by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. I would like to read the whole article to the Senate but I will not. He says early in his article:</PARA>
<PARA>For this reason the level of maintenance paid under the formula will relate to the income of the non-custodial parent and will not vary with the actual cost of caring for the child (or children) for whom it is paid. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other parts of the article that I recommend. He points out the extent to which the amount paid will be significantly less than the cost of supporting a child. The last paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>Given the distribution of earnings cited above, it is likely that under the proposed maintenance formula around 40 per cent of the non-custodial parents in the above examples will contribute less than half the direct costs associated with raising a child or children. </PARA>
<PARA>It was that paragraph that alerted me to the fact that it may well be possible to capitalise on that for those for whom it would be financially beneficial to do so. That is not to say that in a whole lot of other cases, of course, the benefit to supporting children under this formula will not be greatly improved. I wonder also whether or not the formula adequately takes into account the situation of a parent who has the custody of a child who is disabled or very sick. I wonder whether the formula takes into account living perhaps in the country on the one hand or in the city on the other, and things of that nature. Perhaps we cannot tell this at the present time, but they are matters which I think ought to be looked at as time passes, as the previous Act has been looked at from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the issues include the fact that under court orders where parents take the matter of custody to court, the court will be using criteria different from the bald formula which is administratively put into effect. I have mentioned examples querying whether or not we have adequately taken care of those sorts of exceptions, and the case where parents are adequately resourced to make sure that the money changing hands does so in the way that it should. I think the report of Kerry Lovering, who did excellent work on the cost of children in Australia in 1984, is a development in the assessing of child maintenance which certainly was not part of the original assessment when the Act came into being and for a number of years thereafter. That information is particularly valuable, and in looking at that I noted also that under the Child Support (Assessment) Bill 1989 the formula seems to go up only to 34 per cent for four children, and then we run into 36 per cent for five or more children. Maybe once someone gets to five it is all the same, but I would doubt it. That too would be a matter on which I hope the Minister will invite comment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is to be a child support evaluation advisory group to monitor the situation. The group, as has been mentioned by the Minister, is to be led by Mr Justice Fogarty. We have some terms of reference, and are told:</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the group will monitor the level of orders being made by, or registered with, the courts for the maintenance of those children excluded from the assessment process;</PARA>
<PARA>That must be done, in my view. I recognise to change it would be retrospective but I think it is necessary for us to know what the differences are. Further, the group is to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . compare maintenance levels set by, or registered with, the courts with the level of support obtainable under the formula in comparable circumstances; and monitor procedures to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) maximise the coverage of child support received by the sole parent pensioner population; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ensure that the level of child support received by sole parent pensioners is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, the matters that I have referred to all really come within that. I hope that Mr Justice Fogarty and his committee will see it that way and feel free to comment to the Parliament on any other matters that come to their notice, because that is likely to happen with something like this. I hope that it works. I hope that it means that many custodial parents who now live a very precarious existence with their finances and budgeting will be better off, because if they are, the children that they are caring for in fact will be much better off also. </PARA>

<PARA> (c) if the liable parent, on or after the earliest entitlement day and before the application day, paid or provided maintenance for the child to the custodian entitled to child support-the application day; and''. </PARA>
<PARA>I foreshadowed this amendment in my speech on the second reading. I would like to outline the purpose of the amendment. Very simply, the Bill as it stands provides that if an application is made to the Registrar for assessment within 28 days of separation, the non-custodial parent will be liable to make child maintenance payments from the date of separation. On the other hand, if the application to the Registrar for assessment is made after 28 days, then the non-custodial parent will be liable for payment from the date of application. The Opposition feels that if the Bill were to be left in that way, it would be an encouragement for people to take action pursuant to a separation to make it permanent, whereas otherwise, if they wished to wait a little more than a bare 28 days, which we feel is a comparatively short time to try for reconciliation, those people would be disadvantaged. Therefore, our amendment seeks to provide in the latter case for the maintenance to be payable by the liable parent for the 28 days prior to the date of application provided that no maintenance has been received in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, as I said in the beginning, in supporting this legislation, is concerned to see that parents meet their responsibilities to children. We are also concerned that encouragement should be given to families who find themselves in difficulties to try to work those difficulties out and to remain together as a family. We feel that the provision of this 28-day rule is part of that, in that people would not be forced to apply very quickly for an assessment within the 28-day period because otherwise they would miss out on that retrospective payment. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased that the Government is supporting our amendment and, as I said right at the beginning, the Opposition is supporting the legislation because it is in line with our own policy and indeed with the concerns of the Opposition going right back as far as 1980. Senator Crowley in her remarks acknowledged that this was an important issue and, indeed, is more important than political skirmishing. We are talking about the fundamental family unit that makes up this nation of Australia. Senator Crowley talked about the political will of the Government but I think that political will is equally matched by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the speeches that we have heard during the second reading debate have outlined, as in Senator Reid's case, areas which will require specific scrutiny by the evaluation committee. Of course this committee subsumed the consultative committee which was established to oversee stage one and that committee has a most important and ongoing function. The statement which sets out the things that the group will be required to monitor goes to the very heart of the Opposition's concern that all children of separated parents have equal access to fair, secure and regular child support. We feel that the amendment that we are moving to ensure that the 28-day rule will allow people, no matter when they apply for assessment, to receive that retrospective payment of 28 days, having been accepted by the Government, means that the Bill is improved to that degree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were last discussing amendment No. 45 we had had some exchange across the chamber and I think it went something like this. I think Senator Coulter had indicated that he found our provision to include undischarged bankrupts quite unacceptable for reasons which he set out and I think my colleague, Senator Boswell, was also concerned about that. But the amendment actually covers two classes of persons whom we think should not be eligible to be commissioners. The second class of persons, the ones who are not bankrupt, are certain persons convicted of certain offences. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) had responded to say that he thought we were-I think I am reporting him correctly-providing a second sentence. I see the Minister nods in agreement. We have indicated that is not our intention at all but we believe that we can refer back to other pieces of legislation and that it is appropriate that certain people who have been convicted of certain offences, particularly offences of dishonesty, should not then be able to be elected or appointed as commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I remind the Committee that at no stage did we say that should last for their lives; that it should be for a finite period. The period we chose was the period we found in other statutes, but if people felt that was unreasonably long it would be interesting to hear so. Discussion that has gone on within the Opposition following this morning's talk has led me to come back and say to the Committee that if it is felt that proposed subclause (2) (a) is inappropriate-that is the subclause referring to bankruptcy-I would like to know that to know whether we should respond. In a sense, the amendment covers several quite separate matters; it is possible to separate them and it is possible to pull out proposed subclause (2) (a)-it would be possible if the Committee were agreeable-and then to look at the rest of the subclause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Committee, as I did this morning, that the 1988 Bill provided a different kind of disqualification. That has been changed in this current Bill. There has been no explanation of why it has been changed. The Government must have had some reason why it has moved from the previous provision, which referred to a person who had been sentenced to imprisonment of one year or longer for an offence, to another form of words. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people will be electing regional councillors from whom there will be elected zone commissioners, and we think those Aboriginal electors are entitled to a certain amount of protection. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone mentioned the large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people who will make up the electorate, and I think Senator Coulter used the figure of 300,000 people. It may not be 300,000 but it is of that order: it may be a quarter of a million people, but who worries? We are looking at 20 commissioners and, hopefully, they are 20 commissioners with certain qualifications. I put it to the honourable senator that we are not looking at 20 commissioners out of one thousand people, we are looking at 20 commissioners out of 250,000 people. People like Shirley McPherson, qualified people with skills and great probity, do exist throughout the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island world. There is no doubt about that. Anyone who has had experience in the area of Aboriginal affairs would know that that is so. What we are asking is that those who have been shown to be dishonest should not immediately be able to be elected as commissioners; that those who are in prison for a lesser offence-say they are in prison for two years for an offence which carries a maximum sentence of three years-should not be able from their prison to be elected to the Commission but they could, under clause 32 as it is written. So we think the amendment is absolutely required. I say to Senator Coulter: if he finds that the proposed amendment is offensive because of proposed subclause (2) (a), would he please indicate this to the Opposition so that we can respond appropriately. </PARA>

The example I drew was quite deliberately drawn to be an offence not punishable by prison for five years or longer. Any offence that is not punishable by imprisonment for five years would not exclude someone from standing for election.

I do not think that is fair. Not everyone would have the articulate ability of somebody like Shirley McPherson and, perhaps, the resources from her professional work to mount such a challenge. It is incredible that the honourable senator is seeking to put this terrible burden on top of a sentence awarded by the court which would effectively disable somebody from standing for and being appointed to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is one thing for the Minister to talk about an offence of shoplifting. There are many other offences of dishonesty. From my personal experience in this portfolio I am aware of many other examples of dishonesty which are of much greater degree. Let us not just think in terms of this kind of dishonesty. I have seen Commonwealth grant moneys disappear, misappropriated. I am aware of a large number of dishonesty offences which can occur. It is all very well for the Minister to belittle our proposal that any person could go to the Federal Court. We are talking about the stewardship of one of the largest statutory commissions which will exist, a commission which will have at its disposal some of the greatest resources in the country. We are talking about a commission which will make decisions about the expenditure and the disbursement of hundreds of millions of dollars. That kind of responsibility requires some kind of disqualification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no good for the Minister to say that we are imposing a second punishment. The Government has done that already. The Government has actually put these exclusion clauses in the legislation. The Government has inserted a clause providing that under certain circumstances a person is not qualified to stand for election or to serve as a commissioner. It is there. So that is the threshold question. The Government has actually moved down that track. As we have said before, the question now is: how far down the track?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that what the Government has provided is totally inadequate. We are not just talking about the directions of some local football club. We are talking about commissioners who will be responsible, on behalf of their people, for $600m annually. That is a very special responsibility and a very onerous task. We believe that the provisions put in the legislation by the Government are unduly lenient and inappropriate to give to Aboriginal people the protection they need. That is why we wish to get some reaction to our amendment and to our offer to discuss further whether part of it should be withdrawn. </PARA>

I refer to the Australian and New Zealand scientific exploration (ANZSES) trip to Cooper Creek. It is the second, as far as I know, all-women expedition following the `True Desert' expedition which was conducted in the area of Lake Eyre Basin last year by ANZSES, which was also an all-women venture. This time the expedition is setting off to Cooper Creek, and what better time to go, because I understand that Lake Torrens, just south of Lake Eyre in this area, is filled for the first time this century. Lake Eyre is still filling with the waters coming down from the Channel Country-indeed, in your own State, Madam Acting Deputy President.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right, you are on. That is one from either side; we should fix that with the Whips in no time at all. I think it will be a very exciting venture. I read a report in the Australian Magazine of 29-30 October 1988 of their previous expedition called `True Desert'. It would be interesting if the women who went on the first expedition were to go on the second one. They would find, I think, very big changes in that same territory because of the very significant and stunning rains that have fallen. It would be wonderful to take the opportunity to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, as ANZSES expeditions are, scientific in nature, so there will be considerable resource collection and examination of vegetation, birds, mammals, reptiles, insects and arachnids-which I think means spiders. I might have to take Senator Reid along to interpret. Indeed, they will also be looking at some archaeology. They expect some 40 women to attend and, as I understand from Major Fran Conlan, who is leading the expedition, the places are already filled, near enough, and that the women will come, as on the previous occasion, from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. It is open-aged so that young and old women can, if they choose, take up this opportunity to have a very splendid adventure. </PARA>
<PARA> The women who are being encouraged to apply will comprise women with scientific qualifications as science leaders plus general expeditioners. If I were to go I would nominate myself under the general expeditioner category-women who, although not qualified, possess a sense of adventure, a willingness to learn and an enthusiasm to work as a team under the direction of science leaders to achieve the expedition aim. I cannot think of anything better, so if Senator Reid is serious, I will talk to her about it and we will negotiate with the Whips. The application form says they are looking for flexible, mature and enthusiastic expeditioners. I think I qualify. I am not sure about the flexibility, but I will go under the other two headings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very interesting area along the Cooper Creek. It is an area that has not been sufficiently evaluated and can always be researched further in all of these areas. I wanted to place that on the record for a number of reasons-partly to congratulate the women concerned, in particular, Major Fran Conlan who is leading this expedition; partly because I am very excited that women of Australia have such a range of opportunities and there is such evidence, as this will show, of the get up and go of women in this country; and also because it is focused on science. We hear endlessly that women are totally inept in science, have not studied it, cannot do it and all those sorts of things, all of which are totally false. There are wonderful women scientists in this country. There are wonderful women explorers and there are certainly a lot of women with get up and go. </PARA>
<PARA> For a number of reasons I think it was worth informing the Senate that this expedition is being organised. I had not realised that I would have such success in negotiating a pair with Senator Reid, so that is a second great bonus. If Senator Bjelke-Petersen would like to come, too, that would be excellent. What a trio! We might pick up a few more. In fact, we could leave the Senate without its women members. I might do a head count and see whether the numbers work out like that. What a great idea. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wanted to acknowledge this expedition and to take the opportunity to wish it every success on its venture into the interior. I would very much like to go myself. I think many women around Australia would like to go. Perhaps one of the reasons some will not go is that, for whatever reason, they have not got to know about it. We cannot miss an opportunity to put this sort of information into the record. If, by increasing the information supply or spread so that more people do know about ANZSES, about its wonderful trips, about its scientific thrust, its research, and the direction of its proposals, then more men and women around Australia might take up that opportunity. As I said, I congratulate those who have done all the planning to this point and wish all of those who go a wonderful time on their journey to Cooper Creek. </PARA>

I invite her to put up or shut up, to take up the challenge that I have made to her to repeat her allegations outside this place so that we can settle the matter once and for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The live sheep dispute is probably the biggest fiasco that has occurred in the sheep trade since at least 1976 and, previous to that, in the years of downturn, 1969 and 1971. The whole industry-not only the shippers that supply the live sheep market-is paying the price for the internal politics of several other countries. It is obvious that is the situation, because the alleged diseases-I stress `alleged'-sheep pox and Maltese fever have never been known to exist in Australia. Not only are they unheard of in Australia but each shipment is examined before it leaves the Australian ports and certainly no evidence of these diseases has been found. There has been no report on previous shipments either, and that is going back since live shippers have been around, at least for the last 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> From reports that I have on hand I am led to believe that in Saudi Arabia shipments are not tested before disembarking in the Gulf. They are tested five days later on their feed lots. Five days is not long enough for diseases to actually evolve before they are tested, but it certainly leaves the whole subject open to questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Testing methods and indeed the chemical reagents used in those tests have been questioned. Not only have they been questioned but it has been proven that wrong and outdated reagents have been used. As I said, the wrong reagents were certainly used to test brucelli mallatentitus, which, incidentally, is very dangerous and often fatal in humans. If such a disease is prevalent in sheep in Australia, I fail to see where it may be. </PARA>
<PARA> These sheep, when their acceptance was refused in Saudi Arabia, were reloaded from the suspect feed lots and eventually sold to Kuwait. Their transport to Kuwait provided a little more time in which these diseases could have evolved and shown up. Kuwait certainly did not find any disease in them, at least not in the first shipment, but it found reasons to reject some later on. Other shipments actually went to Qatar as well. I would like to speculate, Madam Acting Deputy President, on where the sheep that went to Kuwait finished up. Maybe they got back into Saudi Arabia through the back door at a discount. I have not been able to find out from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) or anyone else in the trade how much discount there was, if any, but I suppose if they were going in through the back door there would have been a discount. </PARA>
<PARA> If they are going in through the back door I suppose that is quite legal but the Australian sheep industry is being used as a pawn in the game. No one can tell me, as I have said, what prices were paid by the Kuwaitis. Complaints by Australian officials-not a very high level of Australian official-have been rebuffed by the story that the Minister is on holidays and does not want to be disturbed. It is fair to say that if the Minister is away on holidays someone else, perhaps an acting Minister, could deal with it. But the whole fiasco has been accepted by this Government, I am afraid, without a whimper. Mr Kerin has done nothing and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is too busy shooting from the hip at the pilots to be worried about such an important situation as the live sheep trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The live sheep trade is worth some $350m a year. It takes six to seven million older sheep, aged 3 1/2 years, away from Australia and it is certainly not an insignificant trade. This case, as I have said, involves internal politics in order to depress the price of Australian sheep. For many years Saudi Arabia has been endeavouring to improve its own industry which is quite a commendable move but, of course, it is doing it with a subsidy. Perhaps the subsidy is starting to hurt now and it is looking at other methods to be able to bring its sheep production forward. Australian wethers are landed in Saudi Arabia at about $A65 and I am told that the internal price has now risen to around $A90; so at that figure I would say it could just about justify its own industry without a subsidy. But unfortunately for Saudi Arabia, its sheep numbers will not stand up for very long and it will soon have a shortage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in this situation we have another European Common Market and United States set-up with subsidies around the world that Australian farmers are suffering. This is achieved, of course, not by honest means but by non-trade barriers. It is achieved by falsely putting down the cleanliness of the Australian sheep industry and that is what worries me the most. This we have to suffer, not only in the Gulf but on the stage of the rest of the world. If we get a name in the Gulf for having unclean products the rest of the world will certainly take notice. This will do as much damage, I believe, as the kangaroo meat fiasco did to the beef trade. I believe that the kangaroo meat fiasco was nothing but sabotage, but my beliefs have not yet been proven one way or the other. In the meantime, while all this is going on, this Government is doing nothing about it. I am sick and tired of the Government licking the boots of our trading partners. When we talk about trading partners I believe we should be partners and not weak-kneed subjectives. </PARA>
<PARA> This term that I use, weak-kneed, could be applied to some of our industry organisations around Australia. Some industry organisations that are supported and financed by farmers are being weak-kneed in this situation. They are preaching peace at all costs. They are saying, `Do not rock the boat'. I put them in the same category. The situation is critical, especially in Western Australia. It is critical because farmers are holding on to sheep which normally would be sold by now. I believe that a rough estimation of numbers is that some 250,000 to 300,000 sheep are being held on the farms. Normally these sheep would be in the process of going right now. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to this, of course, are the other sheep which would normally be turned off at this time of the year. Of course, in Western Australia there has been a record cold winter in the higher rainfall wheat belt and grazing areas and this has prevented the normal growth of feed. Farmers in those areas have been told to hang on to the sheep for a longer period and not to clog the market. Unfortunately they cannot hold on to them any longer. Australia's sheep numbers are increasing at a rate that I believe is too fast. That, of course, was stepped up because of the price of the Australian wool clip last year. A normal turn-off of six to seven million sheep per year to the Arab States helps keep things in balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The abattoir space at the present moment is at a premium and almost totally committed to the ewe mutton trade, so slaughtering in Australia of those shipping wethers is not an option. As happened in 1969, 1971 and 1976, I would not be surprised if there were not industrial action in the abattoirs at such a time while space is at a premium. Of course, this disaster has caused a downturn in the price of all sheep. Shippers, some three or four weeks ago, were making between $28 and $30 in Western Australia and now they are making between $12 and $14. Then, of course, this has flowed through to the rest of the sheep trade. Now we have the older type of ewes that once again are classed as NCV. For the non-initiated, that means no commercial value. This situation has been compounded too for the average farmer by the fact that there is certainly a downturn in the price of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that the Government acted to regain our reputation for clean products around the world. To date no-one has questioned whether the sheep carriers are not the point of infection, if any. It could be that they are. When our sheep land in Saudi Arabia our veterinarians have been testing them and not finding diseases. The sheep carriers-the boats themselves-could have been carrying infection because they are used in different parts of the world, notably Somalia and some ports out of South America. I am not saying that the diseases have come from there, but I know that in some of the cases before today the Saudis have sent shipments back to Somali because of disease. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of some of our own organisations lying down, it is time to act and not listen to excuses, as this Government did when it listened to Vice-President Quayle when he was in Australia, about the wheat issue. It was all platitudes while he was here. Everything was sweet with the Government. Then when he went back we had another great sale of subsidised wheat to Russia, at the time. So it is time to act. It is time to have top level discussions to end the matter and to repair the damage that has been done. It is time that senior Ministers got involved instead of leaving it just to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation or whoever has been dealing with it. It is time that senior Ministers got into the act, including the Prime Minister. Action is needed not only to remove the question mark that has been put over the cleanliness of our sheep on world markets, or any market, but also so that farmers can plan ahead for long term stability. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern is the report in yesterday's West Australian. I do not know whether it has been read over here but I will just read some part of it. The headline reads `Sheep dying in the Gulf'. It cites an official as saying that 5,000 quarantined sheep had died in Abu Dhabi in the past 10 days and that the rest were to be loaded up and returned to Australia. That is the biggest concern that worries me at present. I believe our quarantine laws would prevent their re-entry to Australia. I know live animals can be brought in after three months quarantine, but some action has to be taken now to make sure that those sheep do not come back to Australia and bring in the diseases that they have picked up over there. That has to be prevented at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> So once again I call on the Government to get on with the negotiations. If the Saudis, others in the Gulf, or anyone else who have taken our sheep, do not want to trade with us, that is their business. I do not want to see that trade ended by our being put down in the eyes of the rest of the world. I would like to see it brought to a head so we can plan ahead for next year. Of course, we have to look at the fact that not only the farmers are suffering; this affects all the other industries down the line and the jobs that go with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Just before I came into the chamber I read in the latest telexes that another 100,000 sheep were rejected by Saudi Arabia today as the ship Al Shuwaik pulled into port there. Those 100,000 sheep were cleared by the Australian authorities when they left here, probably some 2 1/2 weeks ago. So the problem is getting more and more out of hand by the day. I make a final plea to the Government and its Ministers to do something about cleaning up the whole situation. </PARA>

Since I have some knowledge of this matter, and since I am a Minister assisting the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), it behoves me to correct the impressions that Senator Panizza has left on the record, lest they remain unchallenged and thus be thought to be approved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point that Senator Panizza has raised is that he cannot get details of a sale price for the sheep rejected by Saudi Arabia and bought by Kuwait. He put that to me in Question Time and I gave him an answer. It is true that we cannot get the information, and we cannot get the information for the reason that the transaction is commercial in confidence. I gave that reply at the time but said that, for the very sound reason Senator Panizza made in his concluding remarks, since it is not desirable to bring back to Australia those shipments once on the water, certainly once they have been in the Gulf, it is reasonable to assume that the price paid by Kuwaiti purchasers of the rejected sheep was less than the Saudis were prepared to pay in the first place. So it is entirely understand- able and very reasonable that we do not have access to the commercial in confidence information, but I think the general observation I make is soundly based. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question Senator Panizza raised is hypothetical. He said that maybe these sheep have found access to Saudi Arabia through the back door out of Kuwait. I do not know that that allegation has been made before. I certainly have not heard it from Senator Panizza and I do not know on what basis he assumes that to be the case, but I propose to investigate the allegation and reply. Senator Panizza observed that it would be a normal business arrangement, and that is true, and it would be a normal business arrangement beyond the control of this Government. It is one of the vicissitudes of commerce in the Gulf, I would suspect, but nonetheless, irrespective of the fact that it is an assertion made without supporting evidence, I will check it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third observation the honourable senator made is that the Government has done nothing. That observation is patently absurd. The first element of it is that he has said that we have sent a very low level Public Service mission to the Gulf. The head of the mission that has gone to the Gulf is Dr Gardner Murray, who is the Acting Director of the Bureau of Rural Resources. He is the Director of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and is a veterinarian of world standing and distinction. Among his peer group of international veterinarians he is regarded as a leader. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is the senior and most appropriate person with the technical knowledge and experience to deal with allegations of disease and to deal with them directly. He is therefore the appropriate person to lead the delegation. That is an appropriate Government response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say, secondly, that Australia has suspended the trade with Saudi Arabia, and that is not a decision taken lightly. It is a decision taken on the basis that the trade had got to a fairly crazy situation in which sheep which were disease-free leaving Australia were diagnosed by Saudi veterinarians as diseased when they arrived there but that we do not have access to the results of the testing the Saudis have undertaken, and at this point we still are denied that access. In order not to prejudice further the trade and our reputation, it was suspended. That is not a decision taken lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> I say, thirdly, that Minister Duffy, Minister for Trade Negotiations, has been active, as has Minister Kerin, in communicating concern and disquiet to the Saudi Government at all levels and, indeed, the Minister for Commerce in Saudi Arabia announced publicly that he welcomed the letter from Minister Duffy setting out Australia's concerns. At this stage the matter is unresolved because the agriculture Minister from Saudi Arabia it appears is not available. Now, I accept absolutely that Senator Panizza has the best of motives. He is unhappy about what has happened. That is a genuine and reasonable motivation and I accept all of that. But to imply that he is more unhappy than we are about it, I think, is to get into a fairly silly situation. We are unhappy about it as a Government and we have taken the logical and most reasonable steps to resolve the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What I think is somewhat to be deplored is the effort by some members of the Opposition to try to grandstand to their own constituencies by making calls for visits of Ministers or the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Gulf, as if that would solve it. There is no evidence at this stage that any such visit would solve the matter. I put it to the honourable senators that simply persisting with those grandstanding calls is, in itself, not assisting the effort being made in Saudi Arabia by our various spokespeople. It suggests that they are not competent to deal with the matter. It undermines their standing in terms of their ability to deal with the Saudi Arabians. It also raises the thought in the minds of some in Saudi Arabia that they should wait until one of our senior Ministers visits, and not deal with the people who are there. I think all of those allegations undermine the effort. I implore the Opposition to join with the Government and support the actions we are taking, rather than stand off as carping critics and take a soft cop that is locally popular but internationally unhelpful in terms of the resolution of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The last observation that Senator Panizza made which I have noted is that Australia needs to act to protect our reputation for clean and disease-free products. I agree. I think the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service enjoys a reputation second to none in the world in terms of our ability to protect Australia from exotic diseases and from infection. We have a very strong place in the market because we have on the international market quality-recognised products and produce from our agricultural output. The reputation of the Quarantine and Inspection Service is without peer in terms of goods being cleared by it for export. </PARA>
<PARA> These sheep were cleared by qualified vets in Australia as being disease free when they left. From that point of view, rather than negatively call on the Government to do something that it already does very capably, I suggest that it would be better to make these points which are valid points to make in this debate. The sheep which were turned away by Saudi Arabia on the basis of an allegation of disease, the evidence for which was not available to our vets to assess on a scientific basis, were accepted in Kuwait on the basis that they were disease free; that is, after they left Saudi Arabia. I think that is a very strong point to make. Standards in Australia are internationally recognised as being very high. While it is always possible, since humans are involved, that there may be a mistake, the probability of a mistake of this magnitude is just mind-blowing. I do not think it can therefore be held, prima facie or on any other rational basis, that there is some error on our part. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that this is a very difficult question. This is a question that does incur losses at a time when wool prices are not as strong as farmers would like. I think it is gratuitous of Senator Panizza to observe that there might be industrial relations disputes in slaughtering in the future. That is simply a gratuitous observation which I think is mischievous. Nonetheless, in getting a proper fix, it is quite right to observe those facts. The argument cannot stop there. If the honourable senator simply rests on the basis that he wants to make those points and express the displeasure he feels-relieve his spleen of the anger that he feels-that is fine, but that, in itself, is no recommendation for action to get results, to change the situation. Expressions of anger on a matter of great passion are understandable, but expressions of anger rarely, if ever, resolve tricky problems. Apart from the grandstanding calls that he would wish to make, the Australian Government has a very responsible presence in dealing with this matter which involves delicate balancings and complexities that, on the surface, sometimes people who talk in generalities do not wish to recognise. We are prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to open up the trade on a proper and responsible basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I would wish that this was a nationally unifying view. I call upon members of the coalition to support the Government in achieving that result. If they do so, the national viewpoint being put by Australia in the quite sensitive discussions that will follow will be at least unified and will have the most force at the most critical time and, therefore, will have the most success in achieving resolution of this matter. </PARA>

<PARA>ABU DHABI: More than 5,000 quarantined Australian sheep had died in Abu Dhabi in the past 10 days, an official said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mohammad Ahmad, head of the municipal slaughterhouse, said between 400 and 500 sheep had died each day of Maltese fever from a shipment of about 15,700. </PARA>
<PARA> Abu Dhabi agreed to receive the sheep for testing 10 days ago after they were rejected by Saudi Arabia, which has refused shipments of nearly 208,000 Australian sheep since July. </PARA>
<PARA> But on August 30 Abu Dhabi turned back another consignment of Australian sheep on grounds that it was unfit for slaughter. </PARA>
<PARA> Saudi authorities had earlier maintained the animals were infected with the viral diseases blue tongue and sheep pox but Australian officials said such afflictions had been eliminated in Australian sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ahmad said 5,300 sheep had died from Maltese fever and the rest were to be sent back to Australia. </PARA>
