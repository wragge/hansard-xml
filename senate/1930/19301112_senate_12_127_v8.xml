                       <para>-  I second the motion. Honorable senators of the Opposition join with the Leader of the Government in congratulating AirCommodore Kingsford Smith upon his wonderful exploit. With those he has already performed he has made his name and that of Australia widely known in the air world. He has established phenomenal records in the air and his flights have been of great benefit to aviation. We heartily associate ourselves with the motion. .

                <para class="block">Honorable senators are well acquainted with the facts attending this unfortunate disaster. It is a matter for regret that on the very day that we have to congratulate an Australian upon a feat in the air, we have also to express our sorrow at a disaster to a British airship. I am sure that the motion will commend itself to honorable senators. It may be some small solace to the relatives of the victims included among whom were the Secretary of State for Air (Lord Thompson) ; the Director of Civil Aviation in Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Seftou Brancker)</inline> ; and Squadron-Leader Palstra, of the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>

                   <para>- I second the motion. It is one of the concomitants of scientific progress that of those who pioneer, a certain number fall by the wayside. The victims of theR.101 disaster undoubtedly lost their lives in what was a notable attempt to demonstrate the suitability of the class of airship constructed by Great Britain, and it is unthinkable that because of this disaster there will be no further progress in the science of air navigation. The victims were national heroes. They gave their lives in the cause of science, and we associate ourselves with the words of regret that have fallen from the lips of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Daly).</para>

                        <para>. - I cannot allow the Senate to adjourn without protesting against the answer furnished to me this afternoon by the, Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> with reference to the exchange position, which I regard as of vital importance to the people of Australia, and particularly our primary producers. The Minister did not so much  as  touch on the difficulties of our farmers as affected by the exchange position, and he did not indicate whether or not this matter had been or would be examined. All he said was that the Government was considering the position of our primary producers. What  has this Ministry done for that section of our people? It has issued proclamations prohibiting the importation of certain classes of goods, it has imposed prohibitive tariffs on other classes of commodities, and it has placed an undue burden of taxation on the community generally, with the result that our primary producers are to-day in a much worse position than ever before. I have made suggestions, which, if adopted, would afford relief. I have urged that, instead of pegging the exchange, the ordinary economic methods for the adjustment of our trade balance should be adopted. If the exchange rate had been allowed to rise to its normal level during the last few years, our trade position would not have been so bad as it is to-day. " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0'HALLORAN</inline> - Surely the honorable senator does not blame this Government for the present position? </para>

Ashworth,  President  of the Employers Federation, examined the trade position of Australia, for several years prior to the economic crisis in the early 'nineties. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashworth</inline> showed that for some years Australian imports had exceeded exports and the people were spending too freely. The position was, however, corrected without resorting to prohibitory tariffs or embargoes, and after the crisis had passed exports again exceeded imports.

                        <para class="block">An Arbitrary Rate. "Unfortunately for producers &gt;of commodities for export," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alford,</inline> "exchange. on the transfer of credits from London to Aus- (tralia lias been, and is still, pegged down to an artificial rate. ' Since February lost that rate has been £U 10s. per centum. Thus the telegraphic transfer of £100 from. London to Australia carries with it a premium of £6 10s. Conversely, £100 in Australia is worth only £93 10s. in London. In other words, the present unfavorable exchange rate means a premium or bounty on exports of 61 per cent., and, at the same time, is equivalent to a surcharge of CI per cent, on imports. A pegged rate of exchange is artificial, restrictive, and uneconomic, for it helps to defeat the very object of a mobile exchange as a corrective of an unfavorable balance of trade. The more unfavorable that balance; - the greater the difficulty of arranging credits abroad- the higher must rise the adverse rate of exchange on that debtor country's paper or bills. " The purpose of the movement of the exchange rate, as a natural corrective of an unfavorable balance of trade, is to stimulate the exports of the debtor country by providing a premium or u bounty on such exports, and to restrict imports by making importers in that debtor country pay, as a surcharge on their imports, the premium or bounty enjoyed by exports. To achieve this purpose the restrictions must be lifted - the peg on the rate withdrawn. An open market for exchange must prevail. Exchange must be auctioned, so that, with the law of supply and demand in operation, the rate will rise to its natural or economic level. With exchange credits available to pay for only £65,000,000 worth of imports (after providing for the £35,000,000 required for interest, &amp;c, abroad) the demand of importers for accommodation in London would be- so keen that the rate would soar to at least 15' per cent, premium' on telegraphic transfers. A bounty of 15 per cent, on wool and wheat would help to save those industries from bankruptcy. It would mean a bounty of l|d. per lb. on wool and 6d. per bushel on wheat on the basis of 3s. 4'd. f.o.b., or nearly 3Jd. per bushel more- than the present 64 per cent, would provide. </para>

                    <para>The pegging, of. the exchange rate at an arbitrary level deprived wheat-growers of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000 on the last crop. Wool-growers probably lost more. It wu.8 not. right that the " powers that be " should, by the retention of artificial means, go on mulcting growers on to what they were properly entitled. It was not right that the restoration of economic equilibrium should be retarded by the refusal of those same " powers that be " to apply the corrective* - the open market for exchange. If restrictions were removed and- the exchange rate rose- to 15 per cent., it would, of course, cost the Governments of Australia about £5,000,000- to arrange1 for credits: in London with which to meet interest payments. On the other hand, that exchange rate- would mean a premium or bounty of £15,000,000 to producers oi| £100,000,000 worth of exports. As the solvency of Australia was dependent upon the ability of primary producers to win through, it was obvious that a premium- of £15,000,000 was more important to the nation than the impost of £5,000,000 - in exchange on Australia's interest bill on her oversea's debt. </para>

                        <para>To be as brief as possible, I would point out that no method of applying the tax could be more simple than on the basis of the record of sales. This would be clear, and free from vexatious complications entailed by the method required by the act, which docs involve keeping distinct and extra records of stock at the 1st August, and manufactures .since that date. The statement that the method followed enables payment to be made on the lower wholesale price really does not mean anything, for payment could still be made on that value when goods are actually sold. </para>

It should be possible so to adjust the machinery for administering this law that  the  three classes of traders would at least be placed on the same basis. 1  hope  that the Government will give this matter careful consideration, and that, should an injustice he found to exist, steps will be taken to rectify it.

                            <para>- I remind the honorable senator that during an earlier part of this session the Government introduced the Central Reserve Bank Bill, the object of which was to place the finances of this country on a sound basis. When that measure reached this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> voted to refer it to a select committee. The Opposition in this chamber, by reason of its big majority, was able to take the business of the country out of the hands of the Government, and to defeat one of its principal legislative measures by appointing a select committee to inquire into and report upon its provisions. Among those nominated for membership on that committee were several honorable senators, including myself, from this side of the chamber. Some of us felt that we could not accept the invitation to act on that committee, seeing that we supported a Government which, although in a minority in the Senate, had a majority of seventeen in another place. On the committee was my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch, who, I believe, is a prospective Senate candidate for New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish, briefly, to supplement the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> in regard to the anomalies in the operation of the sales tax laws. 1" do it with the same object - that the Minister may confer with his colleagues so that we may be able to deal with these anomalies possibly when next the Sales Tax Assssment Bills come before us. 'I have not been able to understand why a differentation is made between a manufacturer who is' not a retailer, and one who is a retailer. As pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> a furrier who is a manufacturer and retailer of the finished article is compelled to pay sales tax on goods he held in stock prior to the beginning of August, whereas a wholesale furrier who is not a retailer pays no tax until the 1st August. The tax is called a sales tax; but the retailer who imports goods from overseas has to pay it at the timeof importation. The actualities are that a certain proportion of the goods upon which he has thus paid tax are never sold. They go out of fashion before it is possible to sell them, yet the tax has been paid on them. It is, therefore, a misnomer to speak of it as a sales tax, when it is really an importers' tax. The matter is one that calls for the consideration of the Government. </para>

                    <para>I have receiveda letter from an individual representative of many hundreds of small business people in Australia who are conducting small confectionery shops. The great bulk of their stock is based on standard lines, the price of which is fixed by the manufacturer, and is advertised on the packages. I am referring to half-penny, penny, and threepenny lines, the main trade in which is done with school children. I have seen four invoices received from the manufacturers, each averaging about £3 10s. or £4, and on the bottom of each was the line, "sales tax, 2s.", or "sales tax, 2s. 6d." The retailer has no opportunity whatever to pass on this sales tax. I estimate that each small shopkeeper is compelled to pay at least £13 a year, with no opportunity of recovering one penny of it. It is impossible to pass on the sales tax on two half-penny sticks of liquorice. It was never intended that elderly people depending upon these small confectionery shops for their living should have to pay as much as 5s. a week in sales tax, with no earthly hope of recovering it. </para>

My reason for doing so was that the honorable senator had concluded his question by urging certain grounds for the unpegging of the rate of exchange. It should be unnecessary for me to draw attention to the fact that, under existing legislation, the Commonwealth Government has no power over the banking institutions of Australia. It has no control over the pegging, or unpegging, of the exchange. </para>

The honorable senator, however, oan rest assured that the exchange position - and, in fact, every position - is being explored by the Government. I repeat what I said to him in answer to his question - I thought the honorable senator would understand me - that the Government is fully appreciative of the very great problems at the present time confronting the primary producers, and that it will take whatever action can be taken within the law in order to bring about the relief of that deserving section of the community. </para>
