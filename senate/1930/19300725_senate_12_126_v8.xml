                as well as other honorable senators, are under a misapprehension as to the reason for the opposition to this clause.

                the head of the well-known confectionery firm, in a statement in the press, outlined the number of awards which applied to his industry. Some honorable senators seem to assume that an industry is governed by one award.
            </para>
            <para class="block">That is not always so. Many industries are governed, hy scores of awards. Speaking from memory, I believe that about 30 awards, both Federal and State, operate in the confectionery industry, -in employee may be working under a Federal award which expires by effluxion of time, when he comes under a State award. The employer does not know from day to day whether some of his employees axe under Federal or State ;i wards. </para>

                GEORGE PEARCE.Awards can expire by effluxion of time or a State award may take the place of a Federal award. Employers who desire to pay award rates should know whether their employees are under Federal or State awards. The practice has been for  !in  employee to notify the employer that lie is a member of  a  certain organization. The employer is then able to keep in touch with the award. He knows for instance if the blacksmiths or engine drivers in his employ are under Federal or State awards. If certain of- his employees are members of the Engine Drivers Association, he knows what rate he has to pay them; and in the absence of that information he may be transgressing  an  award. It is left to the discretion of the court to order that an employee working under a Federal or State award shall notify the employer that he belongs to an organization. This amendment is to prevent the court making an order to that effect. It is not a matter of allowing some employers to pay lower wages, but simply to enable them to loyally abide by an award. If this provision is not included, the court need not make such an order.

                    <para>. - I endorse what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has said, particularly with respect to the position which exists at the MacRobertson works where. I understand the employees are working under at least 60 different awards. Recently I had a most peculiar experience in connexion with a charitable pageant, arranged at Geelong to welcome the famous British aviatrix, <inline font-style="italic">Miss</inline> Amy Johnson, the proceeds of which <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> to be devoted to local charities. When the committee was discussing the arrangements, certain persons offered to do the necessary staff work on the grounds, gratuitously. But in view of the large number of unemployed in the district, it was decided not to accept the offer of a number of young men who undertook to do the work gratuitously, but to engage some of the unemployed. The race-course, which Ls under the control of trustees, was staffed by 40 men who were on duty from about raid-day until 4 p.m. We paid these men 17s. Gd. each which we considered handsome remuneration considering the light nature of the work, and that they were able to witness the pageant free of charge. Within two or three days I received a letter from the secretary of the Theatrical Employees Union demanding the payment of 22s. 6d. instead of 17s. 6d. Had I known that these men were members of the union and. were likely to demand that amount, particularly when the funds were to relieve unemployment, other arrangements would have been made. This experience, I contend, supports the argument of the Leader of the Opposition that employees should notify employers if they are members of an organization. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator were a respondent to the award he would be bound by it in accordance with the law. An employer who wishes to obey the law, has nothing to fear from this provision, and those who do not, have much to gain by its non-insertion. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the position of employees who one day may be under a Federal award and on the following day under a State award. That is impossible as there is a statutory provision to the effect that an award remains operative until a new award is made. He also mentioned the possibility of an employee working under a federal award which might be cancelled when he would then come under a State award. An employee working under a State award would not be affected by this provision. When a federal award ceases to operate this provision has no application. Honorable senators opposite may endeavour to cloud the issue; but they must come back to the point that no hardship can he inflicted upon an employer who wishes to pay award rates, and this is of great advantage in protecting employees from those who do not wish to pay award rates. I ask the committee to agree to the new provision. </para>

                    HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia.)  [11.25]. -  I trust the committee will reject the clause on a much more important principle than that which the Minister says is involved. An Arbitration Court judge is appointed to hear the evidence adduced by both parties and then to decide what shall and what shall not be included in an award. The suggestion of the Minister is that Parliament should usurp the functions of an Arbitration Court judge and tell him what he must and must not do. What right have we to say on the one hand that arbitration court judges and conciliation commissioners shall be entitled to come to a decision on the evidence placed before them, and on the other that a judge or a commissioner having heard the evidence shall insert in an award a condition in accordance with the wishes of the dominant political party for the time being? In my opinion it is one of the most vicious principles that could possibly be enunciated.

                        <para>.  -  An honorable senator before talking of the enunciation of vicious principles should carefully study the measure. This bill imposes limitations upon the power of the judges. The powers of the judges are limited to arbitral matters, and the notification by an employee to an employer that he is a member of an organization does not form the subject of dispute. In my opinion a judge has not the power to insert this provision in an award. A condition precedent to  the  recovery is not an arbitral  but  a legislative provision. </para>

I stand entirely by the principle which I have enunciated. In many instances  two  awards are operating side by side. Surely, then,  an  employe!' is entitled to know under  which award his employees are working. Unless an employee informs him of the union to which he belongs, he will not know under which award his business is being conducted. If we continue to legislate in respect of these minor matters, we shall be compiling a long list of prohibitions against the Arbitration Court, which will make the act unworkable. If we cannot trust the judges to hear the evidence and arguments, and then decide issues, it would be as well to abolish the whole system of arbitration.

This proposed new section will not prove an effective safeguard against the employer who wishes to disobey the awards of the court. I feel sure that in the incident mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> it was the secretary of the Geelong union who demanded union rates of wages for the men concerned. The secretary would do this to bolster up his own position. Unfortunately, there are in this country not a few of these individuals who are always seeking to make trouble. Recently we heard of an employer in Queensland who, while travelling in his motor car, gave a swagman a lift. The man opened the gates for him in the course of the day's run, and later the secretary of the union to which this man belonged, sent a letter to the employer demanding award rates, arguing that he had employed the man to open the gates for him. </para>

The Bank Officers Association of New South Wales is working under a very good award, which it wishes to retain. This section was inserted at the request of that association to prevent federal arbitration judges from joining State associations with federal awards, without first hearing the parties concerned. If the section is repealed State awards may be overridden by Federal awards without consideration being given to the officers concerned and without hearing their objections. If the clause is agreed to I shall submit an amendment, of which I have given notice, to safeguard the bank officers' associations in the various States. </para>

                    <para>. -  The division on this clause will test the Senate as to its sincerity to adhere to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. "We have listened to one or two lectures about adhering to the Constitution, and attempts to take away from a federal court matters in respect of which the Constitution says that court shall exercise jurisdiction. The placitum of the Constitution is that the Commonwealth shall have power to legislate in respect of conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. Parliament exercised that legislative right and established a court, and this clause proposes to enable a Commonwealth court to rid itself of something that the Commonwealth never expected it to shoulder. I invite honorable senators to consider section 38c of the principal act, which reads - , </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The court shall, in the case of every industrial dispute, consider in the course of the hearing and as promptly as possible if there is anything in the nature or circumstances of the industry, or any other reason, which makes it more desirable that the dispute or any part of it should be dealt with by the court than by any State industrial authority or by State industrial authorities in the several States, and, unless the court so declares, it shall dismiss, or refrain from further hear* ing or determining, the dispute or part. </para>
                <para class="block">The citizens of this Commonwealth have certain rights under the Constitution as well as have the States <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> States. They entered into the federal compact on the distinct understanding that in a case of  a  dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State there would be  a  federal tribunal to deal with it. Section 38c takes away from the citizens of any one State the inherent right which is given to them under the Constitution. I shall be pleased to hear whatever arguments can be advanced in support of it, but I fail to see how any of the guardians- of the Constitution on the other side of the chamber could have voted for this provision, and can now vote for its retention. It is a distinct denial of a right conferred by the Constitution on a certain class of people. It gives to a Commonwealth judge authority to take away from a body of workers in any State something that was guaranteed to them under the Constitution, and it limits their right to go to the High Court. The court simply says that it will not hear the case. </para>
                <para>We heard a good deal yesterday and last night about certain High Court provisions being deliberately placed in the Constitution so that those who formed the federation would be guaranteed access to that court. They also are affected by this provision. But my main objection is that it takes" away from the body of the workers who voted in favour of federa-tion a right that was guaranteed to them when the federal pact was signed. I ask honorable senators before they reject the proposal of the Government and vote for the retention of section 38c of the principal act seriously to consider that aspect. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [11.50].  -  I have a good deal of sympathy for the view put for: ward by the Leader of the Senate. I suggest that section 38c of the principal act be rejected because of the wholly unL expected interpretation that was given to the term " extending beyond the limits of any one State." It seems obvious to me that if a dispute does bona fide extend beyond the limits of any one State it is not desirable for the High  Court.  to refer the matter back to the court of a single State. From that point of view I regard the section as an attempt to correct something that it does not correct. I do not think that any one will have the hardihood to argue that the interpretation by the High Court of the words " extending beyond the limits of any one State" does not go far beyond what the framers of the Constitution or the people of Australia ever contemplated. Last night we heard a reference to the long delays that were experienced by, I think, the Sydney tramway employees in having their case placed before the court. It was not contemplated that a dispute of that nature could, by any stretch of imagination, extend beyond the limits of any one State. It was never thought that tramway employees in Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide, each having their separate dispute and governed by individual circumstances, could participate in a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. I think that I am right in saying that lift employees  created a dispute that extended beyond the limits of any one State. I believe that it was to correct such a state of affairs that section 38c was originated. I admit that it is an utter inconsistency with the principle of federal arbitration, and accordingly I shall not be one to make any endeavour to retain it.

                        <para>. - If section 38c of the principal act is retained it certainly, on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch's</inline> own argument, gives to the Industrial Court the right to decide whether a matter is or is not a genuine interstate dispute. Whether the action was right or not, the High Court was set up as the watch dog of the Constitution; and that position has to be accepted. I believe that the reason advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> was really the main feature that prompted Parliament to introduce section 38c but, by a subterfuge, it gives to the Industrial Court the right to limit the jurisdiction of conciliation and arbitration in the case of interstate disputes. Last night the Senate protested against, a certain clause, and it was postponed for further consideration on the ground that to enact it would be to defeat the letter of the Constitution. Whatever might have been the individual opinions of honorable senators, they took the stand " There is the Constitution. We as a Senate have to see that nothing is inserted in our legislation that defeats either the spirit or the letter of the Constitution ". I am not very much concerned whether this provision is cut out. It is consequential upon the other to which I have referred, and there is no necessity for it if the postponed clause is passed by Parliament. If that is done, the class of interstate disputes to which reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> could be dealt with by the industrial court. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to hear that the Minister is not concerned which way the Senate votes in this matter. The provision under discussion is a purely practical one, and is of moment from that point of view. It has been pointed out that there have been a large number of what are really " paper " disputes so far as their inter state extension goes and, in the interests of common sense, if for no other reason, the Senate should retain this provision. It enables a judge of the Arbitration Court to decide whether a dispute is one that should be dealt with by a State rather than by a Federal tribunal. Is it not better that the judge should be entrusted with the power to say " I think that, on the facts, this should be dealt with by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court?" or "There is really not much of an interstate matter in this. As local conditions are affected it is better thai it should be dealt with by a State tribunal ". I do not see the connexion between this and the other clause referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> but perhaps the honorable senator will elaborate that later. If in a proper case, a judge refuses jurisdiction then mandamus will lie to the High Court. That right is not debarred by section 38c of the principal act. I venture to suggest that it has proved in the past to be a very useful provision indeed, and has rid the court of small cases with which it should not be called upon to deal, cases that were of a really intra-state nature, brought before the federal tribunal only because " paper " disputes had been manufactured. The provision is a guard against fictitious and insignificant disputes being brought before the federal court. 1 suggest that whatever else we do we should endeavour to facilitate the work of administration of the Federal and State courts and try, so far as we can, to keep them in their proper respective spheres. I shall vote against the clause. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they could. This section of the act has to be read with the limitations that I have already suggested have to be applied to section 21aa, to the extent that, so far as it is <inline font-style="italic">intra vires</inline> of this Parliament, we hereby enact that the court shall do so and so. That is its only effect. The honorable senator admits that classes of disputes which would appear to come under this provision could be made the subject matter of mandamus to the High Court; in other words, this particular section would not affect them. We have heard a lot of talk about legal entanglements, [nstead of assisting the Government to put up a barbed wire entanglement to keep out lawyers, the honorable senator suggests that we should pull down some of the wire. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [12.2]. - This is an important clause because its purpose is to repeal section 38d of the principal act which permits of an application to be made by any organization or person interested, or the Registrar, for the cancellation of an award in the case of a lockout or strike. We have already agreed to the deletion of the provisions which provide penalties for strikes and lockouts, but this section is on quite a different plane. It would be farcical to permit an organization of employers or employees to register under the act, go to the court, obtain an award, and then promote a strike or lockout and still re main registered. An organization should make up its mind whether it is to be under the Arbitration Court or not, and, having decided to be under the Arbitration Court and having obtained an award, it should not be entitled to say that it is not going to obey that award. Why should it remain registered under an act with the provisions of which it does not intend to comply?

                        <para>- I am speaking of the power to apply for cancellation ; the cancellation itself would naturally be decided upon the circumstances. If section 38d is removed from the act there will be no power to apply for cancellation. Obviously, if shearers in five of the States are working peaceably under an award and the shearers in the sixth State have rejected it, it would not be wise to appeal for the cancellation of the shearers' award; but if the men are striking against an award in every State, then, I contend, opportunity ought to be afforded for an application for the cancellation of the award. Provision is made in sub-section 3 of section 38d, that the order for suspension or cancellation may be limited to persons named therein, to classes of persons of any branch of the organization, or to particular localities, but with the deletion of the section no power would exist to apply for the cancellation of an award as affecting a branch of an organization. </para>

                        <para>- I had forgotten that case, but if a body of men rebel against an award, and even if the leaders of the "particular organization join in the rebellion, I do not think that the door to a possible settlement should be closed against those men who are anxious to return to work. We have heard honorable senators say that the majority of unionists have no desire to cease work. That being so, the penalty provided in -section 38d inflicts a hardship on them, whereas we ought to give every encouragement to any effort that can be made to break down the barriers that prevent men from returning to the work they are anxious to get. It would be a good gesture to men whom honorable senators opposite regard as the more amenable type of trade unionists, if we could say to them that the conditions of employment under the award are still open to them, although they may have gone on strike, and although their leaders may be liable to prosecution, as well as those who persist <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> breaking the State laws against violence. The mere fact that shearers, for instance, may rebel against an award does not justify the court in declaring that there should be a cancellation, if the award is still considered by the court to be a just one. Why should the court suspend an award which contains the best conditions it has been able to prescribe? Is any advantage to be gained by punishing any person or organization? One might feel inclined to punish persons for creating industrial trouble. </para>

                        <para>- I admit it, and, probably, the employees are just as heavily punished by being away from work. But that is not the point; the point is whether it is sensible or practical to cancel an award in the case of a strike. A provision of this character is valueless, unless its effect is punitive. The only punishment it inflicts is the cancellation of an award, thus removing the very incentive that the employees have to return to work. When, an award is cancelled, what is there for the workers to fight for? What is the use of their trying to overthrow these barriers which honorable senators opposite suggest the extremists set up to prevent the moderate trade, unionists from returning to work? I cannot see the necessity for retaining section 38d. Its removal would be, as I say, a gesture in favour of those whom honorable senators opposite say they have every desire to favour. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Senate will not permit the elimination of section 38d. We have already agreed to the removal of the penal provisions of the act in regard to strikes and lockouts, and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> would have us remove the only remaining provision of the act which compels the members of an organization to recognize that if they do not obey an award they must forfeit something. The section provides that if an award is disobeyed it can be cancelled, and the workers lose all the benefits it gives to them. It is the greatest safeguard those workers who wish to continue their work could have. Its removal would handicap those who are always prepared to loyally abide by awards, but who are often intimidated to such a degree that they are compelled to go out on strike with others. </para>

                        <para>- It is unnecessary to cancel the whole of an award. Judges have been very reluctant to deregister a union or suspend an award. In the minds of the public they, at times, have been very tardy in taking either step. They have always been anxious to keep the unions within the court so that peace in industry might be secured. The object of punishment is to keep wrongdoers in order. The same thing is true in arbitration legislation. If this deterrent is withdrawn, the extremists in the community will feel free to continue their nefarious practices. I should like to see a movement by the moderate section of trade unionists in the direction of getting their members to obey awards of the court. In the past they have, unfortunately, been too reluctant to deal with the extremists in their midst. When a strike occurs which dislocates industry throughout the Commonwealth, a judge should have power to suspend the award and deregister the offending union. If the award were cancelled, employers would be free to re-establish peace in industry under the ordinary laws of the country. I do not want to get back to the conditions that existed in pre-arbitration days; but if the unions will not obey awards, the employers should not be bound by them. </para>

The mere' striking out of a definition will not prevent strikes or lockouts.

                        <para>- Should an award be cancelled, two  of  the parties  to  the contract are allowed to run riot, with possible injury  to  the third party. Honorable senators will admit that  if an  award  is  cancelled  no  party  to  the contract can be prosecuted for  a  breach  of  that award. The truth  of  that statement remains whether  an  award affects the whole Commonwealth, a State,  or  only a section of the people  of  a State. Let  us  suppose that  a  number  of  workers  at  Marree  go  on strike, and that  as a  result the court decides  to  cancel the award  so  far  as  it applies  to  them. Those men, although on strike, could not be prosecuted under any Federal  or  State law. </para>

He is not bound by the award if he engages non-union labour. There is no need to labour this point, because it was made very evident during the recent trouble on the waterfront. The waterside workers' award was not cancelled, yet the employers engaged non-union labour. </para>

                        <para>- Personally, I do not think that the provision itself matters very much; but I do not like the possibility of awards being cancelled. In the present trouble in the pastoral industry, the shearers, because of the strength of their organization, would be better off if the award were cancelled. But it's mere existence prevents the trouble from spreading. This particular provision gives a judge the right to cancel an award, and thus leave matters to be settled according to " Rafferty's " rules. I ask the Senate to stand by law and order, and allow awards to remain sacrosanct. Even if we enact a law against strikes and lockouts, that law is not abolished because a strike or lockout takes place. Honorable senators opposite say that awards should be cancelled when not obeyed. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> informed us yesterday that on one occasion he was fined Â£100, and told that if he again appeared in the court on a similar charge he would get six months' imprisonment without the option of a fine. If he had been of a religious turn of mind, he would no doubt have prayed for the cancellation of the award before he again appeared in the court. Seeing that all honorable senators are of the opinion that awards should be obeyed, I take it that they agree that awards in themselves are not necessarily wrong. In that case, why cancel or suspend them ? The awards contain provisions for the punishment of those who break them. There is, moreover, State legislation in respect of strikes and lockouts. I urge the Senate to allow the awards to remain with the imprimatur of the court on them. Their retention will encourage men to return to work. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the possibility of an award being cancelled must have its influence on men who contemplate going on strike. Without that deterrent, they will be more likely to take the risk of striking. In the Bass Strait shipping service there was a strike almost every Christmas. The members of the union now realize that the Commonwealth Government could take over the ships and, by utilizing volunteer labour, maintain the service. The effect of this provision has been that there has not been a strike in that service since it was introduced. The fact that an award may be cancelled has had a restraining influence upon the men. The deletion of this provision will be an inducement to men to go on strike knowing that if they cannot achieve their ends they can return to work under the old conditions. </para>

                    <para>. -  The extraordinary reasoning advanced by honorable senators' opposite in support of the retention of this section reminds me of the old schoolboy classic of " Cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. " Ever since laws have been enacted for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia they have been broken. The law relating to assault is broken every day in the week; but it is not repealed because it is not observed by every citizen. Practically all' other laws are treated with the same contempt by a minority in this community. Honorable senators opposite wish to place the great majority of industrialists in Australia in the position that all law-abiding citizens in this country would occupy if all laws were abolished because a few fail to observe them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> who is in favour of the retention of this section, said that in Queensland they repeatedly had the spectacle of a great majority of the workers loyally obeying the awards of the court, although in two places which he mentioned members of branches of an organization consistently disregarded them. The honorable senator, and those with whom he is associated, argue that, because a minority fail to obey the awards of the Arbitration Court, the awards should be cancelled. If that were done, it would remove the last prospect the majority have of overcoming the militant minority which go on strike. When once an award is cancelled, there is no incentive to the moderates to obtain control. The retention of an award is their only hope. Their only alternative would be to join with the minority and cause a general industrial upheaval. Is that what they desire? We have heard a good deal about industrial peace, but if effect were given to the wishes of honorable senators opposite it would be more difficult of achievement than ever. </para>

Our aim should be to assist citizens under the civil law, or workers operating under our industrial laws, by making laws which can be obeyed. If we are to encourage courts to cancel awards in an attempt to punish certain individuals who may refuse to obey them chaos will reign in industry and the goal of industrial peace will be difficult to reach. </para>

The honorable senator suggests that this section should be repealed, although section 38, which is much wider in its application, is to be retained. If awards of the court are sacrosanct to the Government, the court should not have power to vary, suspend, or cancel awards.

There is a further safeguard, which provides the right to apply for the cancellation or suspension, partial or otherwise, of an award. Power is already given to the court under section 38, on its own motion, to set aside or vary an award. This section enables action to be taken in the direction already provided for in the act. I do not see why there should be any opposition to the retention of the section. </para>

It is rather extraordinary that the Minister should oppose the retention of the section, as the court has to decide the matter. It is seldom that the power is exercised. Those who obtain these awards, sometimes at great expense, regard such a provision as beneficial to their organization, and although it is unusual to suspend an award, such a provision necessarily has a restraining effect upon an organization. </para>

Every effort should be made to prevent their being brow-beaten by the minority, who have caused most of the trouble. The retention of this section will assist the moderate section of trade unionists. </para>

But perhaps it is desirable that I should make one or two observations. Honorable senators opposite have assured us that they are anxious to so improve the conditions of industry as to minimize the possibility of industrial unrest.  I  know of no provision that is more calculated to meet their wishes in this respect than the clause now under discussion. It is freely admitted that there is no objection to men joining trade unions, and no serious objection is offered to preference being given to members of such organizations provided they abide by the terms of an award. The striking out of the words " other things being equal " will impose a heavier duty on the court than at present, because the court will grant preference only if it feels absolutely certain that the terms of an award will be obeyed.  It  should be remembered also that a court which grants preference may also withhold it. If honorable senators opposite wish to put trade unionism on its trial they should pass the clause as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not, but at all events he is honest. I appeal to the former veterans in the Labour movement - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> When I was a boy these senators were looked upon as stalwarts in the ranks of Labour. They were regular attendants at those Labour conventions which laid the foundations for the temple of Labour as we know it to-day. This principle of preference to unionists' has been a prominent plank in the platform since  1905. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> had left the Labour movement in Queensland long before  1916,  when the split occurred in the ranks of Labour over the conscription issue; but the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition was a strong advocate of preference until  1916.  Senators Glasgow, Cooper, Guthrie, and Thompson are associated with the pastoral industry in Queensland. If they contemplated having a homestead built or other buildings erected on their properties they would engage carpenters, and I have no doubt they would give preference to applicants who could produce the pence-cards of their trade union organization, because they', would regard the union card as a guarantee that the trade unionists concerned were efficient workmen. To-day, because of some quarrel with the movement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> once a staunch protagonist of Labour, now finds himself unable to support a principle that previously had his whole-hearted approval. It is interesting to recall that at the third Commonwealth Political Labour Conference, held in  1905, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce was a prominent Western Australian representative, associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Carpenter, M.H.R. All of those gentlemen stood for the fighting platform of the Labour party in its entirety, one of its planks being in favour of an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act to provide for preference to unionists. I regret that at this late hour they should be opposed to that principle. We are coming to- a sorry pass when, simply because a man is a unionist, he is to be penalized when seeking a job. Any of the great manufacturers will tell one, in private conversation, that they are at nil times prepared to give preference to the man who carries a trade union ticket. </para>

The retention of the words " other things being equal " cannot interfere with the employment  of  trade unionists ; it will merely ensure that trade unionists are efficient. Those words were incorporated in the act in order to provide that, if trade unionists offering for a job were inefficient and efficient non-union labour was available the employer would have the opportunity to make his choice.

                    <para>-  When the term six months was inserted in the award there did not. then exist the provision that is now contained in awards specifying compulsory notification on the part of an employee that he is a member of an industrial organization; consequently there may have been a very strong argument in favour of the period of six months. Honorable senators will realize from the debate that has already taken place, that a man must make that compulsory notification before he is entitled to any payment under his award, so that the employer knows from the outset the liability attaching to him. Realizing also that a man is entitled to claim for an ordinary debt, in a court of jurisdiction under the common law, over as long a period of six years is it asking too much of this committee to give to the employee the right to claim within a period of twelve months? The provision of six months was inserted in the State legislation, but honorable senators will find that the South Australian law now provides that a claim may be made before a court of summary jurisdiction at any time within twelve months. Seeing that an employer has no chance of being mulct, because of the existence of some hidden claim, it would not matter whether we struck out the time limit altogether. I can understand the necessity for care in a case where a man might go on innocently believing that he was not liable to pay other than the amount that he was, in effect, paying. But where a man knows from the beginning what his liability is. and that it continues during the whole period of the employment, it is but reasonable to ask honorable senators to bring this legislation into line with that which operates in the States, and extend the term to twelve months. I hope that the committee will not reject the clause. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> is becoming querulous in regard to this bill. I view the clause dispassionately. I suggest that if the machinery provisions for obtaining a secret ballot are troublesome and objectionable, the honorable senator should consider introducing an amendment to the committee on the lines adopted in section 56d of the principal act, or some of the provisions which enable the court to make an order in a proper case. It should, of course, be hedged round with safeguards, so that it would not be based on the understanding that it  is  right that ten members of an organization, concerning whom the Assistant Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> made some observations last evening, may cause trouble. That the secret ballot in this connexion can be of utility was shown some years ago, when its application was attended with very good results. The ballot taken among the New South Wales railway employees the other day was likewise attended with excellent results from the point of view of the community and of industrial peace. It is quite a mistaken attitude for the Government to take up that there is no good in these secret ballot provisions. I urge the Minister to reconsider the clause and submit something to the committee, which, while perhaps less  cumbersome, would be equally beneficial. He could take section 56d as a starting point with the maintenance of the provisions for the enforcement of a ballot by the court. But to cut out the whole of the provisions relating to secret ballots, it seems to me, would be  a  rash step to take; it would not be in the interests of the maintenance of industrial peace, and certainly would not improve control of unions by the rank and file. If the Minister cannot agree to my suggestion, I must vote against the clause. </para>

At times, there may be justification for trespassing upon the rights of individuals or organizations, but Parliament should not trespass upon those rights unless it is satisfied that some good can be achieved by doing so. </para>

                        <para>- Every organization of which I have any knowledge has in its rules provisions for the holding of secret ballots. But honorable senators will realize that the provisions in the act were inserted mainly for the purpose of preventing strikes. I am not going to deny that they also give opportunity for an expression of opinion, but all the secret ballots one cares to take will not prevent a strike if a number of men decide upon striking. In connexion with the ballot which was ordered some months ago, a ballot box was burnt along with an effigy of the arbitration judge. It brings the nation into ridicule when an attempt is made to enforce laws which are not enforcible. For years, we in Australia have been making ourselves believe we are what we are not; we have been spending money we did not have; we have been living as we should not live, and we have been legislating as we know we ought not to legislate. These provisions were inserted in the act while we were living in that atmosphere of hypocrisy. We are now living in different times when we must face the facts. We must be honest with ourselves and not pass legislation which we know in our hearts we cannot put into effect. I say to honorable senators in the words of Shakespeare - </para>

                    <para>. -  The rules of an organization cannot be registered until they are submitted to the Registrar and he is satisfied that they contain nothing contrary to public policy. A hyper-sensitive legislature at one time conceived the idea of depriving an organization of the power it possessed over its members to prevent them from entering into written agreements in accordance with an award, but, like the secret ballot provisions the provision is worth nothing. It means nothing more than that the rules of an organization shall not contain something which will prevent it from entering into a written agreement in accordance with an award. If any such rule appeared, it would be disallowed by the Registrar. He is directed not to register any rule which would have certain consequences. </para>

                        <para>- As this matter is now before Parliament, I suggest that we should give expression to something which will not demonstrate to the world that we do not know what the functions of Parliament are. It is not the function of Parliament to tell the Registrar that he may register an organization only if its rules comply with certain requirements - one of which is that such rules shall not be contrary to public policy - and then immediately insert another provision which, if it means anything at all, means something affecting public policy. I realize that if a majority of honorable senators favour such a provision I can do no more than object; but I desire to place on record my objection, as a member of the Government, to a provision which, in my opinion, is being inserted merely to placate the members of the Employers Federation. </para>

            <para class="block">Wo have already abolished the provision for penalties in respect of strikes and lockouts; but it would be a mockery for us to allow the union to obtain an award and then immediately, through its officers, agents or committees, attempt to nullify that award by advising its members not. to comply with it. Either we have arbitration or no arbitration. No arbitration system can exist without trade unions. In a sense, the officials of the trade unions are the machinery by which arbitration can work. It is surely the most arrant humbug to say that we shall have a system which allows trade unions, or their officials, to take a case to the court and immediately an award is given to engage in active propaganda against that award by inciting their members not to accept employment under it. The object of this new clause is to make it an offence so to incite the members of an organization. There is need for it, seeing that we have abolished the penalties for strikes and lockouts. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the committee will not agree to this new clause. I again appeal to honorable senators to be consistent, even in their desire to defeat this rneasure. As has been pointed out by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition . <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> the committee has already decided to abolish the penalties relating to strikes and lockouts. That was done because the committee knew that in every State there is ample provision for the prosecution of men who offend against the law by going on strike. In all legislation relating to this particular subject there is a provision that any person who encourages, incites, or otherwise counsels or procures the commission of an offence shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be punishable accordingly. Just as the committee has decided to vacate that field, the Opposition, merely in order to show its power, proposes to insert this new clause, which is only a palliative to keep quiet some person or persons who might rebel against the deletion of the penalty provisions of the existing legislation. I realize that we on this side are a helpless, but well-meaning minority. If the majority of honorable senators desire to take this action, then they must accept the responsibility. I appeal to honorable senators, if they have not already made up their minds, to reflect on what they have already done, and their reasons for having done it. They have decided to withdraw from the field of penal legislation ; but they are now asked to agree to the insertion of a new clause, the necessity for which is said to be that very withdrawal. The insertion of this new clause will mean conflicting jurisdiction. I can only express my regret that the numbers on this side are so few that we cannot successfully resist this provision. </para>

                    <para>- As the court may decide that is a sufficient reason I shall not press for the retention of that paragraph. Paragraphs j and <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> relate to an organization which has made domestic rules ordering its members to act in defiance of an award. On a previous occasion I directed attention to the mischievous rules drafted by the Waterside Workers Union and their effect upon the industry. When Judge Beeby gave his award regarding the two pickups on the waterfront he dealt very extensively with the abuse of such rules. I know it is not the practice amongst trade union organizations generally to adopt a course similar to that followed by the Waterside Workers Federation, and I doubt whether there is any other organization in the Commonwealth that has abused the practice to the same extent. They may have learned something. A trade union receives all the benefits of an award which are sometimes destroyed by domestic rules. </para>

                told us of a case in Hobart in which certain members of a trade union organization were ordered by the branch secretary, under a domestic rule, to act contrary to an award. Those who did so were fined. They informed the magistrate that if they disobeyed the branch officer they would be fined by the union, and if they obeyed him they would be fined by the court.

                PEARCE.That imposed by the court, which I think was Â£2 and costs. The magistrate commented upon the disgraceful nature of this practice. If an organization is to act in that way the court ought to have the power to de-register it. In these circumstances I ask the Minister to retain these paragraphs. Arbitration court judges do not de-register unions without very careful consideration. In the case of the Seamens Union the court hesitated for months before deciding to take such drastic action. When members of an organization have repeatedly or systematically committed offences against the act, or have failed to comply with an order or award of the court, there should be power to cancel the award. To test the feeling of the committee I move -

                    <para>. - I appeal to honorable senators to consider this matter from a viewpoint which I am sure will appeal to them. When an organization is registered under this statute it is in law similar to a registered company. It has a common seal, and is entitled to hold property. Is it the practice under British law to deregister a company when the members of boards of directors make a mistake? If honorable senators will refer to the original sub-section they will see that it was only when an organization ceased to function as a property-holder that it could be deregistered, with the exception that if the court for " any reasons " the court thought fit it might cancel registration. Some ingenious person then came along and drafted this section, in the belief that it was in the interests of those who at that time were returned to Parliament on the false cry of law and order, and who were determined to carry into effect a supposed mandate from the people. </para>

                        <para>- I was charitable enough to put it in that way. The position is that Parliament deliberately inserted in this provision something which contravenes the principles of British justice, for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> recently made a strong appeal. I ask honorable senators opposite, some of whom have had extensive experience in company matters, to consider the position of a registered company which consists of something apart from shareholders or directors. Does the committee wish the court to continue to have the right to deregister organizations, destroy their character, and the right to hold property, and to bring about a state of chaos through something which may have happened by the action of men whose minds were temporarily inflamed? </para>

                        <para>- No ; but immediately that organization was de-registered it was impossible for any member of it to enforce his individual rights in that property. If the shareholder of a company has any claim against the company he can sue it; but if the company goes into liquidation or if, by some other means, its entity is destroyed, it cannot be sued. Honorable senators opposite, in objecting to the repeal of the sub-sections affected by this clause, desire to perpetuate a manifest injustice, as judged by the recognized standard of British justice. Last night I listened to an eloquent appeal to the committee to reject the Government's proposals because, so it was alleged, they would strike at the very foundations of British justice. The sub-sections of the principal act, which it is now sought to repeal, discriminate in an iniquitous manner between persons and organizations. There is sufficient power under existing statutes to punish offenders against the law. Why should the Australian Workers Union, the largest industrial organization in Australia, embracing members following many avocations and working under many awards, be penalized as an organization because 20 or 30 of its members refuse to obey the awards of the court? </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not, but it is cowardly to ask the judges of the Arbitration Court to do what the legislature itself has not the courage to do. If Parliament believes that this is the proper course, let Parliament take full responsibility for it. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable senator knows that it has not. This is the first time that a Labour government has been in power for many years. This legislation is designed to give trade union organizations the same status as any other company. There should be no discrimination against industrial organizations constituted under statute. The provisions which it is sought to repeal relate mainly to offences that may be committed when the minds of members of an organization are inflamed during industrial disturbances; and as I have pointed out on previous occasions there is power in existing statutes to deal with them. It is iniquitous that in such circumstances there should be the possibility of cancellation of regulations with consequent loss of property. It is not equitable to destroy a legal entity simply because certain of its members or, for that matter, the leaders or directors have committed breaches of the law. </para>

                    <para>.- One cannot but admire the earnestness of the Leader of the Senate in his desire to secure the passage of his bill. But I am afraid that he has over-reached himself. He appears to be entirely ignorant of the motive which actuate those honorable senators who intend to support the amendment of the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
