No aerial disaster has been occasioned on that account, and if any pilot flying in the Northern Territory has been hampered during his journey, the reason is rather on account of the lack of natural features which could be included in any topo graphical map compiled.

                    <para class="block">The Imperial Conference of 1926 declared that the dominions are " autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations." It then went on to state as principles that it was the right of the Government of each dominion to advise the Crown in all matters relating to its own legislation, and that legislation by the British Parliament should only apply to a dominion with the dominion's consent. It decided that it could notwith safety take more definite action until it had obtained expert guidance. It accordingly recommended that a committee should be set up to report on various aspects of the operation of dominion legislation, and that a subconference should inquire into the subject of merchant shipping' legislation. It was later decided that the committee and subconference should be organized as a single conference, and it met in London from the 8th October to the 4th December, 1929.

                    <para class="block">The conference was an advisory body, and its recommendations, contained in the report now placed before the Senate, are recommendations to the Governments of the various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as such will be considered by the representatives of those Governments at the Imperial Conference this year. The Constitutions of the self-governing dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations are contained in acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and it is from this source that legal power exercised by the dominions under those Constitutions flows. The paramount power of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to make legislation binding on all the King's dominions exists in law, although its exercise is regulated by constitutional conventions. The implementing of the report of the Imperial Conference of 1926 resolves itself into a question of the Parliament of the United Kingdom formally renouncing the exercise of its legislative powers in respect of any or all of the dominions, except at the request of the latter. This, generally, expresses the major conclusions reached by the conference. </para>
                    <para>Taking the recommendations rather more in detail, the conference first of all pointed out that the deletion from the Australian Constitution of the provision for disallowance by the Crown of legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, and reservation of legislation for the Royal approval, are internal matters for the Australian Commonwealth itself. The conference next recommended that an act should be passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, with the consent of all the dominions, declaring that the parliament of a dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation. This recommendation was made . to meet the point of view of the other.- dominions, for the Commonwealth Parliament has, by its Constitution, power to make laws with effect outside the Commonwealth. Theprovisions of the Constitution with respect to external affairs, the relations of the Commonwealth with the islands of the Pacific, fisheries in Australian waters beyond territorial limits, immigration and emigration, and naval and military defence, give the Commonwealth Parliament a large measure of power in this respect. Section 5 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act declares that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships whose first port of clearance and port of destination are in the Commonwealth. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, such' an act would be subject to the Commonwealth Constitution, and would apply only to those subjects over which the Commonwealth, has jurisdiction. </para>
                    <para>The third subject which was referred to the conference for investigation, namely, the extent to which the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865 should be amended or repealed in the light of the existing relations between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, may be regarded as the central point of the work of the conference. The report of the Commonwealth Government's representative sums up the position in this respect, as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The general application of the principle of equality laid down by the Imperial Conference in 1920 was at once accepted, and with' the result that the unqualified paramountey of the legislation of the Parliament of the" United Kingdom must go. That involves that no future legislation of that Parliament should apply to a dominion without its consent, and, secondly, that dominion legislation should no longer be invalid or inoperative by reason of repugnancy to Imperial acts extending to a dominion. But the precise manner in which these applications of principle should be given effect to was the subject of long andanxious debate. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The conference adopted the view that the only way to give effect to the principles laid down by the 1926 Imperial Conference was to repeal the Colonial Laws Validity Act in so far as it applies to laws made by the parliament of a dominion, and recommended that legislation be enacted by . the Parliament of the United Kingdom to this effect. To guard against this purely negative solution of the problem leading to confusion. the conference recommended that this legislation shall also provide that dominion legislation shall not be held invalid on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England or British legislation, and that the dominion parliament shall be empowered to repeal or amend a British statute, which forms part of the law of the dominion. </para>
                    <para>The conference recommended that the most desirable method of giving effect to the principle of the equality of status of the United Kingdom and the dominions, in so far as the legislative power of their respective Parliaments is concerned, is for the forthcoming Imperial Conference to place on record a constitutional convention, expressed as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United- Kingdom shall extend to any dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that dominion. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It is. recommended that this convention should be inserted in the recital or preamble of the proposed...act of the  Parlia-ment  of the United Kingdom referred to above. In order ,to meet practical difficulties it is recommended that this proposed act should contain a provision that no act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall in' future extend or be deemed to extend to a dominion unless it is expressly .declared therein that that dominion has requested and. consented to the enactment of such legislation. </para>
                    <para>The establishment of a number of parTliaments in ,the British Commonwealth of Nations with what will be in practice equal legislative authority raises the question how uniformity is to be secured with regard to the several matters as to which uniformity throughout the British Commonwealth is desirable. The succession -to the Throne, nationality, naval prize law and prize courts are the outstanding examples. The conference recommended that a constitutional convention should be agreed to by the different governments of the Empire that any alteration in the law touching the succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall require the assent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as well as the assent of the parliaments of all the dominions. It is suggested that this constitutional convention should be also included in the recital or preamble of the act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom referred to above. </para>
                    <para>The acquisition of equal legislative authority by the different parliaments of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and conferring on those parliaments of the power to give their laws extraterritorial force, gave rise to a discussion of the question of the nationality of British subjects. The problem which . will confront the various governments of the British Commonwealth of Nations will be that of reconciling the general rules providing for a single nationality for all British subjects with the particular rules which the parliaments of the different parts of the British Commonwealth may find it desirable to lay down in respect of the status of their own citizens. The conference did not come to any conclusions on this difficult question, which will require further examination. </para>
                    <para>The recommendations of the conference in respect of merchant shipping legislation are of a particularly technical character. . The disappearance of the paramount power of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in- respect of this subject will. give rise to questions of a somewhat special nature. The recommendations of the conference on the matters touching merchant shipping legislation are not exhaustive, and it is likely thai further consideration w.ill be required to be given to various points in connexion with them. </para>
                    <para>Finally, the conference realized that if in the future the' principle of agreement between  the various members of the British Commonwealth is substituted for the paramount authority of the" British legislature, differences may arise between the Governments concerned' with regard to these agreements. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will remember that when Australian and other members of the British Commonwealth accepted the optional clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court last year all, except the Irish Free State, made the reservation that their acceptance did not apply to differences between themselves. Some method of settling such differences there must be, and the conference gave some consideration to the proposal for a  tribunal to deal with differences between the different governments of the British Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>What I have said will give honorable senators some idea of the many important matters dealt with in this report. Some of them affect the States as well as the Commonwealth, and it will be understood that careful examination here and further discussion at the Imperial Conference are necessary before the Government brings down detailed proposals for giving effect to them. </para>

                    <para class="block">I submit this motion for the purpose of directing attention to the rationing of employment in the military section of the Defence Department. It will be said, probably, by those who defend this action of the Government, that the alternative to rationing of the military section in the department is dismissal. I think I shall be able to submit to honorable senators a number of facts which will prove that that is not the alternative. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> in a statement to members of another place yesterday, set out the particulars of the rationing scheme which, he said, was based on the decrease in military activities due to economies that had been effected in that department. I put it to the Senate, however, that if rationing is due to the lessening of military activities, the scheme must affect the whole of the department, for it is obvious that if a certain amount of employment is given on the military side by holding of camps of training, these camps and similar military activities are the <inline font-style="italic">raison d'etre</inline> of the civilian staff. What is the duty of the civilian staff in the Defence Department if it is not to do the clerical work associated with military camps of training, and other administrative matters? Civilian employees are engaged on the administrative work of the Defence Department. From this it is clear that if the reasons given by the Minister are correct and if there is a decrease in military activities, there must ensue a lessening in the amount ' of employment on, not only the" military side, but also on the civilian side of the department. Every one regrets the need for rationing employment as an alternative to dismissal or any other form of sacrifice by any section of the Government employees. But if sacrifices are to be made, they should be made equally by all sections of employees in the department. There should be no discrimination. One section, comprising men who are unable to speak for themselves and defend themselves, should not be called upon to make a sacrifice while another section of employees, who have powerful organizations and associations to speak for them, escape. Employees in the military section in the Defence Department are quite properly forbidden to form or join associations or unions, </para>

                        PEARCE.Because we do not wish to see repeated in Australia certain happenings that have been reported in Russia. Civilian employees in the Defence Department, on the other hand, are entitled to form themselves into unions and associations, and they have behind them the Public Service Association with which they are affiliated. That, however, should not influence the Government when faced with the stern necessity of having to make savings.
                    </para>
                    <para>In order to show that it is possible to effect economies, and to maintain something like equality of sacrifice, I propose to place some facts before the Senate. According to the latest report available, the permanent military forces in the Defence Department number 1,718, and their salaries amount to Â£520,554, or an average salary of Â£303 per annum. The civilian employees, who, as I have said, are employed almost entirely on military work on the administrative side, number 709 andtheir salaries amount to Â£257,239, or an average salary of Â£362 per annum, so that the average annual salary on the civilian side is more than the average annual salary on the military side. Under the British army system those occupying civilian positions in our defence department would be sworn in as soldiers, and would not be entitled to be members of unions or organizations. Those working under that system in England are doing exactly the same work as for the most part is done by these 709 civilian employees. This matter was raised to-day in a series of questions submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott, who asked why any discrimination is being shown.

                    <para class="block">The policy of the country is preference to returned soldiers, other things being equal. </para>
                    <para class="block">The great bulk of these men who have been dealt with by this unfair discrimination are, with the exception of a few who were too young to enlist even at the close of the war, returned soldiers. The total number of officers and warrant officers affected by the rationing proposal is 211 officers and 395 warrant officers, or a total of 606. If we are to have a rationing system, and if economies are to be effected that will result in loss to some members of the Service, returned soldiers should not be the first to be affected. I understood that the Government had given an undertaking that in carrying out its policy, the principle of preference to returned soldiers would be observed. Yet this body of men, practically all of whom are returned soldiers, has been singled out to bear the whole cost of the economies to be effected in this department. It is a fact that not all of those employed on the civilian side are returned soldiers, because that staff was necessarily recruited and kept in Australia during the war. A number of them have been on active service; but quite a number did not serve abroad, because their duties kept them in the department. If a sacrifice has to be made it should not be borne by this department only, it could be spread over the whole Public Service. But if it is to be borne only by this department, obviously it should apply to both sections of its employees. If we are to observe the principle of preference to returned soldiers, the rationing system should apply also to the clerical portion, and not only to the military staff that consists largely of returned soldiers. It is said that their duties are dissimilar; but from my knowledge of that department with which I was associated for many years, I challenge the accuracy of that statement. The clerical staff does a good deal of the administrative work in connexion with military camps and home training; but in many places throughout the Commonwealth that work is done entirely by members of the military staff. At headquarters it is more convenient for the work to be done by the civilian staff. Some sergeants-major and adjutants do exactly that class of work as a portion of their military duties, and therefore it is incorrect to say that  the duties are dissimilar. The only difference is that while the clerical employees devote the whole of their time to clerical work, the military employees, particularly those associated with the training of the army, occupy part of their time on military work and a part on clerical work. To that extent their work is similar to that performed by civilian employees. </para>

                            <para>- It is part of their ordinary duties for which they are paid. Under this system of rationing the Government aims at saving Â£60,000 a year; but, let us consider the individual sacrifices to be made. An officer receiving a salary of between Â£500 and Â£600 a year will be called upon to make an annual sacrifice equal to Â£80 a year. That is a savage, and, I feel tempted to say, vindictive victimization of such unfortunate officers. Because of the necessity for economy, a military officer with a salary of between Â£500 and Â£600 a year is to sacrifice Â£80 of his salary in one year, while others in the same department are not to make any sacrifice at all. </para>

                        PEARCE.About 700 civilian officers and 606 military officers are affected. A warrant officer in receipt of Â£250 a year will have to contribute approximately Â£40 a year; but a clerical officer who
                    </para>
                    <para>Bits  alongside him and who perforins the same work - the only difference being that he is not in the military section - is not to contribute a penny or lose an hour of employment. </para>
                    <para>Let me proceed to show the way in which this sacrifice, if it has to be made - and I admit that it probably will have to be made - could be spread over a much wider field. If we are to consider the question of sacrifices, we must explore a much wider field than the one department, and consider whether such sacri fices should not be spread over all the departments, in which case the loss to the individual would be negligible. A perusal of the Public Service Board's report for the year ended the 30th June last, shows that on that date there were 28,764 permanent officers in the Public Service, and 2,591 vacant positions. Certain deductions bring the total down to 30,738 positions. If sacrifice is called for, surely it would be fairer to spread it over the whole Service than to single out 600 men to bear the whole burden. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. Excess civilian officers have been transferred to the Public Service. The report referred to also shows that new appointments to the Public Service for one year represented salaries amounting to no less than Â£213,063. I suggest that ifwe have this plethora of educated men - and these men to whom I have referred have had to pass a stiff educational examination - they could be appointed to vacant positions instead of appointments being made from outside the Service. They would do as well in those positions as the men who have been appointed to them. Last year, the salaries, wages, and allowances of permanent and temporary officers of the Public Service amounted to Â£10,160,875. Extraneous payments, which I shall itemize presently, amounted to Â£573,439. The total salary payment for the year, therefore, amounted to Â£10,734,314.No great sacrifice would be demanded of the public servants generally to save Â£60,000 out of that amount. Among those extraneous payments are the following: - Travelling allowances, Â£162,551; overtime, Â£91,957; Sunday, duty, Â£97,348; higher duties allowance - that beautiful system of musical chairs to which I referred when dealing with a Public Service bill some time ago - Â£92,971. In the previous year, the higher duties allowance was Â£84,000. Perhaps honorable senators do not thoroughly understand the nature of this allowance. In practice, it works out somewhat as follows: - If a highly paid officer goes on leave, every person in the department below him moves up one position, and automatically receives the salary of the man whose position he takes during the period that the man first referred to is on leave. That is the blissful system introduced by the Public Service Arbitrator which cost the country Â£92,971 last year. Other extraneous payments for the year mentioned, were : - Away from home allowances, Â£9,291; district allowances, Â£46,649; holiday pay, Â£46,976; travelling time, Â£25,696; making up the total of Â£573,439 to which I have already referred. I suggest that even a 10 per rout, reduction of those extraneous payments would effect the saving desired without hurting a single officer. They would still be in receipt of the highest salaries of any government employees in the Commonwealth, and probably in the world. Certainly, their salaries are higher than those of State officers. I emphasize that these payments are merely extraneous. </para>

                    <para>During the year with which this report deals, 1,764 new appointments to the Public Service were made. If new appointments are to continue at that rate, it would be necessary to suspend new appointments for only six months to absorb these 600 men in the Public Service. </para>
                    <para>The report also shows that in the Public Service on the 30th June, 1929, there were 8,882 temporary and exempt employees. What is 600 among that number ? Merely by suspending the engagement of temporary employees, those 600 men could be absorbed easily. The Public Accounts Committee has called attention to this matter in a report which has been presented to Parliament. I am quoting these figures in order to show that the saving desired could be obtained without the public servants being called upon to make any real sacrifice. By doing away with overtime payments, the Government could save one and a half times as much as these officers are called upon to give up. Surely honorable senators opposite have no objection to doing away with overtime, seeing that to do so would be to act in accordance with trade union principles. </para>

                        PEARCE.I make bold to say that the next Public Service Board's report will show that the expenditure for overtime has been muchthe same as in previous years.
                    </para>
                    <para>If other avenues of saving one and a half times as much as these 600 men are being called upon to sacrifice are sought, they can be found by doing away with the higher duties allowance, by a reduction of 1 per cent, in the salaries of public servants generally, or by reducing the extraneous payments mentioned by 10 per cent. The average salary of public servants, including 8,000 boys and girls, is Â£286 per annum. If those youths are excluded, the average salary would be much higher than the average salary of the military officers who are called upon to make these heavy sacrifices. According to the Public Service Board's report, the average salary of adult males in the Public Service is Â£335 per annum. Of course I know that public servants are numerous in the community and that these military officers form a minority. I know also that the public servants represent votes; but that fact ought not to guide the Senate, or even the Government. The underlying principle should be to mete out justice evenhandedly. I am not concerned about the votes of the public servants. I stand for a. principle. In the long run the public will see that justice is done. I remind the Senate that these military officers are not allowed to form a union or to exercise their political power publicly. Seeing that they are unable to protect themselves it is our duty to protect them from victimization. There can be no question that, as between dismissal and rationing, the latter is the more humane system ; but rationing of the savage and vindictive character proposed by the Government is not justified. If rationing is necessary, it should be universal. </para>
                    <para>I know that it will be said that the Defence Department is the only section of the Public Service in which there is a falling-off of work; but the latest figures relating to the post office, as published in to-day's press, indicate that that is not so, for it appears that the revenue of that department has decreased by Â£368,000. That decreasing revenue suggests that it would be possible to decrease the' number of employees in that department. I do not want to see any one dismissed, whether a military or a civil officer ; but I see no reason why these men should be dealt with in this savage! and discriminatory fashion. The civilian staff  of the Defence Department should be removed to other Public Service departments, and these military officers and warrant officers should be given clerical duties in the Defence Department. If any one has to be dismissed, it should be the men. who are not returned soldiers. That is the only way in which effect can be given to the principle of preference to returned soldiers, and if it were done, the services of these men could be retained. </para>
                    <para>This Government appears to me to be out to destroy our defence forces. From the commencement, it seems to have had that end in view. As one who had the responsibility of building up the Defence Department, I know the work and time it took. The present Government is victimizing 396 warrant and noncommissioned officers of the instructional staff. Let me tell honorable senators what had to be done as a preliminary to get our scheme of universal military training going. "We had to borrow warrant officers from India and  Great Britain and bring them here-; we had to put into a camp for .twelve months or more, the Australians who were selected to be warrant and instructional officers of our future forces. They. had to be trained, not merely for. military work, but also so that they would be able to carry on the clerical or administrative side of the work. Because it  was  urgent to' get the scheme of compulsory military training going, we had to 'send these men , out to the various districts, but they were being continually brought back to " camp for' further' courses of instruction. If it had not been that Duntroon had already been  going  for some little time, we would have been at our wits end to- secure the necessary instructional officers. As it was; we had to improvise by utilizing citizen force officers to act as area officers until Duntroon could supply a sufficient number of instructional officers. </para>

When the Government has done what apparently it is out to do - when it has destroyed the military forces of this country entirely - and this country sets out again to rebuild them, it will take at least five years and probably longer to get back to the stage of efficiency we had reached by 1913-14. Any one can destroy or pull down, and this picking out of certain men, this unequal, sacrifice, is one of the most fatal blows -that could be struck at our defence policy. What does it say to these men ? It says, " You are fools to fit yourselves for the defence of your country. If you want to have an easy time, do not become military officers; do not try to become instructional officers in the defence forces; get a clerical job and join a union and nothing will be done to you. If you are fools enough to qualify as commissioned officers or as sergeantsmajor to train the Australian youth to defend their country whenever the time comes, should we ever be hard-up or find it necessary to save money, we shall take it out of your hides ; because you will not have a union to protect you".- </para>

This country has passed its judgment on the work 1 did at that time, and I have no . need to apologize for not. being a returned soldier. I stand here to-day to defend men who are returned- soldiers, and to say that the Government's policy is one of savage victimization. It is utterly uncalled for, and, in my judgment, is a deadly blow at the effectiveness of our defence forces.

                            <para>. - The matter of the rationing of work in the military forces is necessarily wrapped up with the alteration of Government policy in regard to military training. The two things are so intertwined that it is impossible to deal with the one without referring to the other, and I think it my duty to make the position clear to Parliament and to the people of the country. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> from his point of view has put forward a reasonable case. Other honorable senators outside the chamber have criticized the Government on the rationing of work and on the change of policy from compulsory to voluntary training. Any reply to the case set out by the Leader of the Opposition must necessarily involve a reply to the criticism which recently has been levelled at the Government's policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> is reported in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> on the 9th June, 1930, to have said that - </para>

                        <para>The position in regard to the defence of Australia was an extremely grave and serious one. Since the war, the Commonwealth had backed down considerably on its defence policy. Last year there were 48.000 men in training, and. on top of that there were 17,000 or 18,000 cadets who would have been signed on in due course. However, the new regulations did away with ail these men. and it was thought that 35,000 men, which was the number hoped for by voluntary enlistments, would be sufficient for the needs of the country. But the objective which had been set for the authorities last November had by no means been reached by a long way, and there were only 26,000 in training. " We read in the papers," said <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> " that voluntary enlistments have exceeded the most sanguine expectations, and that everything is going very well. But I want to give the lie direct to these statements, which are damnable, rotten, mean lies." </para>

It has had to make a curtailment for the current year of over Â£150,000, and of the huge sum of Â£500,000 for the coming financial year. Every avenue that it was possible to explore with this end in view was examined, and the spectacular savings that are now being made are a proof of the wastefulness that has been sadly in evidence over many years of previous administration. </para><para>The cost of the Naval College, by its transfer to the Flinders Naval Depot, will be reduced from Â£64,752 to Â£15,000, or thereabouts, per annum. The cost of the Military College, if it is to remain where it is, can be cut down by Â£11,000, but the position is still being investigated to see if a much larger reduction than this can be made. It is confidently hoped that some . means may be adopted whereby the two colleges will be run at a total cost of not more than Â£40,000, at most, although they were costing the country, under the late Government, Â£117,000 per annum, thus effecting a saving of Â£77,000 without any reduction, of efficiency. The transfer of the Naval College to Flinders was recommended by the First Member of the Naval Board. This, and the other striking savings, have been made without any reduction of efficiency. </para><para>The basis of 35,000 of an establishment of troops was agreed to by the Council of Defence, and it is a nucleus which can be expanded to 180,000 men to repel any prospective invader. That wasall the previous Government had provided for. </para><para>These necessary savings in our dire extremity have been made difficult by certain members of the Opposition who have used the opportunity to decry the present defence system. In spite of these petty attacks, the Government will go on with its task. . Its platformprovides for adequate defence of the country against aggression, and itstands four square to that principle. Ministers feel that the real ' cause of the chagrin of their opponents is the fact, that the voluntary enlistment system is proving a success, although with their bitter attacks and sinister whisperings, they said that the Government was destroying the defence system. </para><para>The following recruiting figures to the end of May bear eloquent testimony to the success of the voluntary system :  - </para><para class="block"><graphic href="125332193006252_10_0.jpg" /></para><para class="block">Honorable senators will realize that the new policy has been in  operation  for only five months, but during that time the Government has reached its objective to the extent of 77 per cent., and at the rate at which enrolments are taking place - about 2,000 a month - we shall have considerably exceeded our  estimates  within another five months. So much for the gentlemen who say that the new system has been a failure. The figures that I have given completely refute the statements that are made owing to a lack of knowledge of the facts. I have given this information to honorable senators so that they will not continue to go round the country telling the people what is untrue. I recognize that they have done this in ignorance, and the Government is pleased to enlighten them on the matter. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition, speaking of overtime in all the departments, estimated that, if it were cut out, it would effect a saving as great as that which the Government hopes to make by rationing employment in the Defence Department. As a matter of fact, every department has had instructions to eliminate overtime. In all departments men have been kept out of employment in the past, owing to the operation of overtime. The Leader of the Opposition sa"id that 600 men was too big a proportion of the employees in the Defence Department to whom to apply the rationing proposal. Considering that there will be 35,000 men in the forces when the voluntary scheme is completed, as against the 47,000 before the reductions were made, 600 is not a very great percentage, having in mind the fact that there are '200,000 men in other occupations outside the Public Service on the unemployed market. Therefore, employees of the Defence Department ought to feel particularly fortunate in that so many of them have retained their positions in the Service. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3154</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KN7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GUTHRIE, James</name><name role="display">Senator Guthrie</name></talker><para>- Why have not the clerical officers been rationed? </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3154</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, John</name><name role="display">Senator Daly</name></talker><para>- The employees in other departments have been reduced in numbers to an absolute minimum. </para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3154</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1L</name.id><electorate /><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BARNES, John</name><name role="display">Senator BARNES</name></talker><para>- The Leader of the Opposition, in concluding his remarks, said that it was easy to pull down, but it required ability and efficiency to build up anything that was worth constructing.

The present Government is not responsible for it, and I am not wholly blaming the late Government for it, although I believe that the fault lie's with it to a large extent. Nobody regrets more than members of the Government the great misery that obtains in the community, and the inability of the Ministry to do what it would like to do to alleviate it. In the Department of Works and Railways we could go on with millions of pounds worth of work, if we had the necessary funds. I have no desire further to depress the spirit of the people, but, perhaps,, we have not yet reached the limit of the sacrifice that they will be called upon to make before they see a silver lining through the dark clouds that now hang over them. Every member of the community must feel the deepest regret in finding the country in this unhappy predicament, and the Government would be prepared to take some risk to alleviate the sufferings of the people if it could, see its way clear to do so. Ministers are as alive as anybody else to the needs of the situation, and are prepared to go as far as they possibly can to improve the position. </para></talk.start></continue><para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM</inline>GLASGOW (Queensland) [4.19]. - The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> has not satisfactorily replied to the arguments presented by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> whose case was unanswerable. He devoted a considerable portion of his time to the repetition of the statement made in the other branch of the legislature yesterday, not in reply to the case built up by the Leader of the Opposition, but by way of an attack on two honorable senators. I say immediately that if we are to choose between rationing and dismissing employees, I much prefer rationing, because the permanent officers of the Defence Department have devoted the whole of their lives to fitting themselves for positions as specialists. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has indicated, it will be exceedingly difficult for these men to find other employment in the Commonwealth. The right honorable gentleman properly emphasized that thi3 rationing scheme, as applied to the military section in the Defence Department, is a severe tax upon a very small section of the community.

It is provided, moreover, that any savings that can be made in any branch of the Defence Department during 1930-31 will be applied towards the reduction of the enforced leave without pay to be borne by members of the Permanent Military Forces. It is confidently expected that the result of the application of this principle will be that the maximum period of eight weeks enforced leave for 1030-31 will be considerably reduced. </para></quote><para class="block">That is a dangerous principle. If the Government intends to ask the department to effect further economies on the military side, there is the risk that, the savings will be in directions in which expenditure is absolutely necessary to ensure efficiency.

As a matter of fact, we had a number of statements from the Minister informing us of his intention to build up the defence system by voluntary enlistments and provide for the future administration of the military and naval colleges. On every occasion the Minister emphasized that, notwithstanding proposals to reduce expenditure, he intended to ensure the then high standard of efficiency in the forces. These statements were, of course, ludicrous. The Dun- ,troon and Jervis Bay Colleges have no equal in the world for efficiency. Both institutions have turned out boys able to hold their own in competition with boys trained at any other military or naval colleges in the British Empire. In the  year  before last three boys from Jervis Bay, who were doing certain courses in England, competed with boys from the British colleges. Two secured first place in their courses, and the third boy was second. It is absurd to say that it is possible to maintain defence efficiency with a reduced expenditure.

Under the system approved by the previous Government, our defence organization  was being built up on a nucleus basis. Each year 45,000 men were undergoing training, and we were turning out a reserve of 15,000' men. In the course of a few years we would have had a fine reserve of men well trained in military tactics. The present voluntary system will not train a single reservist. Every man who enlists will either remain in the forces for perhaps twenty years or go out at the end of six months. Consequently, we shall be unable to build up a reserve, so the statement of the Minister about the efficiency of the Army under the voluntary system is absolute nonsense. </para><para>The Government's action is breaking the spirit and morale of the Permanent Forces.

According to answers supplied to questions which I asked on the 19th June members of the Public Service were, over a period of three years, granted increases which amounted to Â£193,000 annually and the increases to be paid from the 1st July next will amount to Â£180,000. If these increments were to be suspended for one year a saving equivalent to more than three times that proposed would be made. A reduction of salaries would not be involved as these officers could continue at the rates they are now receiving. It is difficult to understand why the Government should single out the unfortunate returned soldiers when reductions are to be made.

                <para class="block">These eminent gentlemen are members of the Australian War Council. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> asked them those questions ke knew that, according to the army regulations of other countries, they would have been shot if they answered them. Judging by some of the interjections by honorable senators opposite, a steel bullet would not make any impression on them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott said that we should find employment for some of the navy officers who have been dismissed. The honorable senator receives Â£250 per annum from the Scullin Government asa retainer for his military services. I ask him whether he is prepared to forgo that amount in order that these dismissed officers may share it.He would still have his Â£1,000 as a member of this Senate, and, in addition, a comfortable practice as a lawyer. I suggest that the honorable senator write a note to the Minister for Defence along the following lines: - </para>

                    who also receives a retainer for his military services, might write a similar letter. Indeed, as I watch the honorable senator's benevolent countenance, I feel sure that he will do so within the next 48 hours.
                </para>
                <para>There is justification for rationing in the Navy, as the following figureswill show. In 1920, when we had 32 ships, 262 officers were employed; whereas in 1929, when we had only sixteen ships, the number of officers had increased to 270. The majority of those men receive big pensions from the Imperial Government. Their salaries are not inconsiderable, as a perusal of the following statement will show :  - </para>

                            <role>Vice-President of the Executive Councils [4.59]. - I sincerely hope that the Senate will not pass this motion. I do not propose to traverse the ground which has already been covered by various speakers or to support the statements of any honorable senator in particular. Any government must regard, as serious a motion by a private member to adjourn the Senate. I therefore propose to confine myself to the subject contained in the motion before the Senate. The adjournment of the Senate is sought on the ground that the Government has discriminated unfairly between its employees in the Defence  Force and those in other departments. I remind honorable senators that, at the present difficult time, the policy of the Government is to reduce expenditure to a minimum. In order to do so it has already made considerable reductions in every department. The clerical staffs of the various Public Service departments have already been reduced to a minimum. In dealing with the Defence Department the Government had to decide between dismissals and rationing. The men with whom this motion deals could not be transferred to the Public Service because, as honorable senators know, the Public Service Act ties the hands of the Government in connexion with employment therein. The Minister for Defence (Mr. A. Green</role>

I point out that the particular step to which objection is now raised was not taken before the Minister had conferred with one of the leading members of the Opposition in another place concerning it. I am instructed by the Minister that when a deputation met him in connexion with the rationing, he was approached by the  Deputy  Leader of the Nationalist party in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> and advised that, if the Government introduced a system of rationing into this particular section of the Defence Department, in preference to dismissing the men, such action would meet with the approval of the Opposition in another chamber. That intimation was made in another place last night by the Minister for Defence to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> I ask honorable senators to look at this question from the point of view from which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> saw it when he spoke to the Minister for Defence. Honorable senators will realize that this statement is not one to which a reply cannot be given. It is my duty to communicate to this chamber the statement supplied to me by the Minister for Defence in this connexion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett</inline> realized that these men were trained for a special class of work, and that, if dismissed, they would find it difficult to obtain work. </para>

I remind him that this Government was not responsible for the introduction of that system; that it must administer the Public Service in accordance with the legislation governing it. In administering the Public Service, we must have a sufficient staff to allow for the fact that throughout the year, some men are away, on leave or holiday. It is, therefore, necessary so to arrange the personnel as to fill up any gap and avoid the possibility of destroying the efficiency of any particular .department. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Pearce)</inline> has not shown that there are positions in the Public Service which the men in the defence forces can fill. There are, of course, certain duties in the Public Service they could perform, and as a matter of fact, wherever it has been found possible to transfer ' to positions in the Public Service any of the men who have been retrenched because of the defence policy of the Government, they have been so transferred. One of them is now working, in the particular department administered by me. . In other departments, too, there are men who have been thus transferred. But the Government is really at its wits' end to know what to do with the staff it has at present. We know that we cannot go on without a defence staff capable of coping with peak periods. We must maintain our defence forces at a point of efficiency; otherwise we might as well hand over our country to some one else to govern. But if we had adopted the policy pursued by the previous Government we would have dismissed all those who were not actually required-. </para>

We believed that we could carry on without dismissals and we have dismissed men only when it has been found absolutely necessary to. do so.. The rationing system has been introduced in order to reduce dismissals to an absolute minimum. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> asks why it is not being applied throughout the Public Service. Apart from the fact that the numbers in the Public Service have already been reduced to what is necessary to maintain efficiency, the Public Service is covered by arbitration awards. We could not have rationed the men of the Defence Department if they, had been covered by an arbitration award. We would have had to dismiss all beyond the required number. It was because the men in that department were not bound, by an award that .we were able to accede to their request that the sacrifice should be shared among them. </para>

                    <para>It has been suggested that some of the defence officers might possibly be transferred to the postal service, but I can assure honorable senators that the Postmaster-General is already at his wits end trying to keep his present staff in employment. When the principle of preference to returned soldiers was discussed in this chamber some weeks ago, it was shown that the number of returned soldiers in the Public Service was by no means small. Honorable senators must realize on reflection that if the policy they are now advocating were carried into effect, it would mean forcing some men, possibly returned soldiers, out of employment. As we cannot ration the Public Service, it is impossible to bring these defence officers into the Public Service and indulge in a general rationing scheme. There is nothing, therefore, for which the Government can be censured. I can assure honorable senators that had we dismissed men we should still have maintained the defence staff at the efficiency point. For the time being we are now above that point, but, as the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> has indicated, the new recruits we expect to receive during the balance of the year will create more work. The Government will maintain the defence instructional staff at the efficiency point and, at the earliest moment, will' rid the Service of this rationing system. I trust that the Senate, in its wisdom, will reject the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - In this matter we must recognize the sign of the times - economies are absolutely necessary - but I think we must also recognize that discrimination has been displayed against a very deserving class of public servants, if they can be so called. They are, in any case, in the service of the Commonwealth, and among them are quite a number of sergeantsmajor who, as my long experience in the defence4- forces, extending from commander of a company to that of a brigade, has led me to conclude, are really the backbone of our defence forces. It is very unfair to discriminate against them in the way the Government has done. The Assistant Minister has shown that already 77 per cent, of the required numbers under the voluntary scheme have been enlisted. The scheme seems to be going ahead satisfactorily enough, and the fact that all organizations have to be maintained as a nucleus indicates that the same work is required from non-commissioned officers and instructional staff. A reduction of the forces from 47,000, or whatever the number was, to 35,000, does not mean that any one's services can be dispensed with. The organization must remain practically the same; just as many instructional staff officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, will be needed to instruct the reduced number as were required to cope with the larger number. </para>

                    <para>The need for economy is reflected in commercial life. Rationing has been adopted in commercial life. In one case which has come under my notice, employees have been given one week's  holi-day  without pay in four. They would rather have that than have a reduction of hands. I would not raise my voice' against this proposal if the whole of the Public Service were to be rationed. From a hasty calculation, it seems to me that the rationing of one week a year throughout the Public Service would save at least Â£200,000. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the rationing of one week in a year would not lead to any lack of efficiency on the part of the Service. I heard the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> say that it was impracticable to ration the Public Service, because of arbitration awards, but it has not been found impracticable to have rationing in the railway service of New South Wales. If there is anything in the Commonwealth Public Service Act to prevent its being done, surely it is worth while to introduce a short amending bill to give the necessary power, I advise the Government to adopt that system., and I would go further and include members of both Houses of Parliament. They could give up the equivalent of one week a year in order to assist the Government in this trying financial time. I protest most strongly against the rationing system as applied to the defence staff only. </para>

The men in this department are prohibited, by law, from becoming members of a union, and being thus deprived of the opportunity to use the Arbitration Court as a means of defending themselves, they have been treated shamefully by the present Government. </para>

                            <para>- That is beside the question. The Government has victimized these men because the law prevents them from combining to protect their own interests. The Leader of the Government said that the fact that the Public Service was working under Arbitration Court awards was the very reasonwhy the Government could not have recourse to rationing generally. I point out that the Government, like any other employer, can approach the Arbitration Court. This has been done in Queens-' land and New South Wales, and, in my opinion, it will yet be done throughout Australia. These men have been victimized because they are defenceless. It. is a most despicable act. I cannot find words strong enough to express my feelings. The Government has taken a cowardly advantage of its position. The Leader of the Opposition spent years at the head of the Defence Department, and he has spoken of the value of the services that these officers render. Why should they be treated in this unfair manner? We do not know how soon they may again be called upon to defend this country. I would vote for the adjournment of the Senate if the carrying of the motion would result in any benefit to these men. I have every sympathy with Ministers in the position in which they find themselves owing to the present economic conditions ; but I strongly object to injustice being done to men who cannot defend themselves. I hope yet that the Government will approach the Arbitration Court and have the rationing system applied to the whole of the Service, so that all its members may ' assist in extricating Australia from its unenviable position. </para>

                        <para>. -  We on this side regret, to as great an extent as honorable senators of the Opposition, the necessity that has arisen for interference with the conditions enjoyed by the military staff of the Defence Department.  We recognize the valuable services that they gave to the nation during the late war, and have given since, and we repudiate the suggestion that the. action of this Government in introducing the rationing system, at the request of the men themselves, is. a savage attack upon them. That suggestion is not justified by the circumstances, if they are viewed dispassionately. Much of the indignation that has been expressed by honorable senators opposite is due not so much to sympathy for the men as to a desire to enhance the prestige of themselves and the party to which they belong. </para>

                            <para>- I w I withdraw it. I shall say that honorable senators opposite have an entirely mistaken idea of  the motives of the Government, and their action this afternoon may result in those motives being misunderstood by the people. Their desire is to detract from the prestige of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> became angry, and said that it was making a vicious attack on men who were prevented from banding themselves into a union for their protection. Will that honorable senator support an alteration of the military regulations to permit permanent officers to enjoy privileges similar to those afforded to the civil staff of the department? If he will not do so, there is no justification for indignation on his part. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Other honorable senators desire to create the impression that the Government has taken this action in order to suit its own convenience, because, owing to the change over from the compulsory to the voluntary system of enlistment there is a temporary shortage of work for the permanent military officers. I point out, however, that there may be sufficient work to keep them fully employed when the voluntary enlistments have produced the quota desired by the Government. The inference has been drawn by some honorable senators this afternoon that the Government is victimizing these men; but it was explained by the Assistant Minister that the reorganization of the department had been effected, not to strike a blow at the defence system, but to exercise the economy that the present straitened condition of the public finances demands. This reorganization has reduced the volume of work to be done by the permanent officers, and the Government's expert advisory board has drawn attention to the fact that the services of a number of officers are not required at the present time. Rather than turn these men adrift, after years of valuable service, into civil life, where it would be particularly difficult for them to find a niche, the Ministry agreed to the rationing system, and we have the assurance of the Leader of the Government that it is merely a temporary expedient, because steps will be taken to remove the hardship imposed on them as opportunities occur. He pointed out that some of these men had already been transferred permanently to other branches of the Public Service. Eur-  ther  opportunities for their absorption in other departments will occur from time to time, and they can then apply for transfers in the usual way. Therefore, the general conditions in the Public Service need not be disturbed. As permanent military officers reach the retiring age, vacancies will occur from time to time, and to that extent, too, the difficulties will be minimized. I have already mentioned that this action has been forced upon the Government by the deplorable condition of the public finances; This is not the only government which has reduced defence expenditure in recent years. The Bruce-Page Administration, of which the Leader of the Opposition was the leader in this chamber, last year made a sweeping cut in the defence vote, and applied the reduction to certain branches of the Service. Were protests then made by honorable senators opposite? Were indignant speeches delivered in this chamber or in another place about the victimization of returned soldiers - men who had spent their lives in fitting themselves to serve the nation in this particular sphere? No. Honorable senators opposite were " stone cold." The Standing Orders prevent me from saying exactly what I think of their attitude towards this matter. </para><para>Let us examine the policy of the previous Government as disclosed in the report of the Defence Department, which is available to all honorable senators. In explaining the defence policy of the Bruce-Page Administration for the year 1929-30, the report states that because of the difficulties of the financial situation the Government found it necessary to abandon all idea of immediately developing its policy. It was obliged to restrict expenditure on defence by Â£544,000. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Nav Naval ratings were retrenched, at all events, and I suggest that a private in the army or an able seaman in the navy is entitled to the same consideration that is given to an officer. The Bruce-Page Administration also dispensed with the services of between 120 and 130 men employed at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, as well as 80 men and women in the munition factories at Footscray and Maribyrnong. These employees would be covered by awards and could not be rationed. I have no doubt that many of those dismissed at Lithgow and Maribyrnong were returned soldiers, and to-day are still unemployed. As I have said, honorable senators opposite did not then raise their voices in protest against the action of the Bruce-Page Government. These men served their country in war, as in peace, and were entitled to the fullest consideration; but because of the financial difficulties then confronting the Government their services were dispensed with, and we now have the spectacle of these men in the army of unemployed. The majority oil them never enjoyed more than the basic wage. It was pointed out this afternoon, in defence of the Government's action, that although ' the men rationed will lose a fairly substantial sum individually not one will be brought down to the basic wage level ; and none will be worse off than the great majority of those whose services were dispensed with by the previous Government. If one may judge ' from statements that have been made during the debate, one might be pardoned for believing that honorable senators opposite desire a smashing attack to be made on wages all round. This suggestion has been made by adherents qf the Nationalist party, and by the press which supports it. </para>

' -He said he was advised that the Government would be forced to either ration or dismiss a considerable number of employees, and he expressed the opinion that rationing would be preferable to dismissal. He did not, nor was he asked to, express any opinion as to whether the scheme should be confined to the' two sections of the Permanent Forces. </para>

I have no intention of dealing with it now, but I shall, do so fully and frankly at the proper time and in the proper place. </para>

                    <para>We are told in the official memorandum issued by army head-quarters to the various units that, consequent on the reduction in establishments from 49,000 to 35,000 in the militia, and from 16,000 to 6,000 in the senior cadets, it has been necessary to either dismiss a certain number of the Permanent Forces or ration them. The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Halloran),</inline> said that this rationing scheme was adopted at the request of the persons concerned. I suggest that his statement is a slight exaggeration of the truth. Naturally j if employees were given the option of rationing of work Or dismissal, they would prefer rationing, but to say that this rationing scheme was adopted at their request is rather wide of the mark. With them it was' a case of " Hobson's choice." </para>
                    <para>It appears to me that the Government has not given sufficient consideration to the dangerous consequences of its scheme. In paragraph 11 of the memorandum issued by the department, it is stated that the Government has approved of the principle that any savings effected in any direction by the Defence Department may be applied to a reduction of the period of leave without pay to be taken by members of the Permanent Forces. At first blush it seems to be a sound and safe rule, that if economies can be effected inside the units the expenditure saved should be applied to reducing the periods of enforced leave without pay to be taken by those who have been rationed. But the danger lies in the temptation to effect so-called economies which, in actual fact, would not be economies at all, in order that the personnel could reap the benefit of the money saved. I have had considerable experience in defence matters during the last 30 years, and I know that in many directions opportunities will be presented to effect economies in units in connexion with corps contingency allowances and the training vote. I know also that if the expenditure is not adequate the standard of efficiency will be seriously impaired. It is contended by those who support the Government's action that, because of the reduction in establishments, there will be less work of a military nature for the military staff. In actual practice this will not be the case in my own unit. Although Our training strength is now considerably below what it was under the compulsory system last year, the same administrative work will have to be carried out. It should be remembered, also, that under the compulsory system we got the cadets for training in a body in July of each year. We knew the number that would be coming on to the strength, and we could go ahead with our arrangements. That condition does not obtain to-day. In my own unit we are doing everything possible to stimulate recruiting, but the best we can hope is to get recruits in, at the most, three or four at a time. This irregularity makes the administrative work and . training more difficult. </para>

I shall not be able to send one of the other warrant officers from head-quarters staff as on the score of expense alone there would be his rail fare and other costs associated with the change over. It is not easy. I have worked out a <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> roster of my permanent staff, which numbers six, four of whom are members of the head-quarters staff in Launceston and the other two at country centres. I am not imputing motives, but to my mind it is a most inequitable way to treat these men. Why should one section be singled out for a drastic cut in the form of rationing? My adjutant is a keen young officer with a good record who received his training at the Royal Military College at Duntroon, and who has now had fourteen and a half years of service. He was too young to go to the war, but after completing his training at Duntroon he served in India, and was badly wounded on the frontier in 1919 or 1920. He has been with me for five years and ever since taking up military work has devoted a tremendous amount of time to the study of his profession. He is a most valuable officer, and his training has cost the Commonwealth quite a lot of money. Recently he received his captaincy and married, and his salary is now to be reduced by approximately Â£70 a year. What a reward for meritorious service! It takes years of hard work and patient study to make a really good soldier. I suggest that the Government should dispense with this musical chair game under the higher duties' allowance system in the Public Service, which is' unsound, as an officer temporarily filling a higher job is learning work which he will ultimately "have to undertake. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that it did. I am suggesting that it would be more equitable to dispense with that system than to introduce the rationing system to one small section alone. A higher duties allowance is an incubus on the Public Service. For the life of me I cannot see how this rationing system is to be effectively carried out, particularly in two country towns which I have in mind. I do not see how efficiency is to be maintained, and, after all, a defence force is not of much use unless it is efficient. When economies have to be effected the burden should,, as pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition in his able speech, be more evenly distributed. It is grossly unfair to confine the system to a small body of professional men who cannot speak for themselves. I trust that some other method will be found because we cannot afford to lose the services of these men, on some of whom a mint of money has been spent in fitting them for their profession. The business 'of trying to build up a well-equipped and controlled military force is a long and weary one. That was what was being attempted when the present Government practically wrecked the whole system. </para>

                        <para>. - I sympathize with the Government in its attempt to defend its action in this connexion. The repeated attacks which have been made upon the defence, system by this Government give the impression that its policy is to undermine the. defence system of Australia. Its latest act is in the direction of rationing the work amongst a number of specialized men who form a portion of the personnel of the Defence Department. As stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> the officers to be affected have spent years of arduous work to reach their present stage of efficiency. Moreover, they have to incur greater expense than others on the civilian side of the Defence Department, as they have to maintain two complete outfits, and have always to present a smart appearance when carrying out administrative work and when training troops. They receive a small allowance for military clothing, which, I contend, is insufficient to provide them with all that is necessary in that respect. They have always to set an example to the trainees under their control. Their hours are unlimited, as, in addition to their administrative work in the department, they occupy a good deal of time in the training of troops and in giving instruction to trainees requiring special assistance. As pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> it will be exceedingly difficult to replace officers on leave, who, on returning, will be compelled to work much longer than members of the clerical staff, who receive similar remuneration, and "who will not be affected by this scheme. It should be the policy of any government to encourage the young men of this country to become officers of the Permanent Forces ; but, under the present system, the service of officers, which would be valuable in time of war, will not be available. The action of the Government appears to be a deliberate onslaught upon the permanent officers of the Military Forces, who are not permitted to become members of an organization or association, which would protect their interests. When it was suggested that rationing should be introduced throughout the Public Service, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that the Public Service Act rendered that impossible. I draw his attention to section 70 of that act, sub-section 1 of which provides - </para>

                            <para>- If the Government wanted to ration the whole Public Service, it could easily do so under the provision I have quoted. But rather than apply the rationing system to the Public Service generally, the Government prefers to penalize these men. That is most unfair to permanent officers of the military forces, who ask only for similar treatment to that meted out to other officers in the same department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> said that there was a great deal of unemployment . through the country. Unfortunately, that is so. No one sympathizes more with the unemployed than do honorable senators on this side. But there is a difference between the general body of the unemployed and these men. A world depression has caused universal unemployment, due chiefly to the lack of private capital. The first men to be affected by that depression are those who have had no special training. The men referred to in this motion have been trained in highly specialized and necessary work; they have put in years of study and hard work to qualify for their positions; their position is entirely different from that of the ordinary worker, whose employment is subject to market fluctuations and other considerations. In times of prosperity men employed by private enterprise frequently earn large incomes. Public servants have no such opportunity. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the . motion, which is important, while at the same time I recognize the great need for economy on the part of the Government. In its attempts to economize the Government  should take  pains to see that no one section shall be called upon  to bear the whole  burden. As pointed out by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> the men whom the Government has singled out for heavy sacrifices have had  no  opportunity of presenting their case through any organization, as public servants generally have had. </para>

                            <para>- By a reduction of less than 1 per cent, of the salaries of all public servants, including members of Parliament, Â£100,000 per annum could be saved. But rather than make that reduction, the Government prefers to penalize a body of men who have proved their fitness for their positions, and, moreover, have had no opportunity of adding to their income by earning overtime, notwithstanding that they have worked many hours overtime during their career. I know that some of the men in question work very long hours. They have to be at call at any time. If they had had the privileges enjoyed by ordinary public servants, they could, perhaps, better stand the application of the rationing system than they can now. </para>

                            <para>- I have only a few more words to offer in support of the motion. I am of opinion that rationing is certainly a far better method of dealing with the situation as we find it today than a series of wholesale dismissals, but rationing, unless it is applied generally, is not fair. Why a particular section of men who have served their country well should be selected to bear  the whole of the burden passes my comprehension. Without being uncharitable, I can remember a short time ago when an effort was made -to remove the policy of preference to returned soldiers that has been in operation in Australia for many year's. Evidently the Government is now determined to give preference to returned soldiers - preference to bear the burden. It is unfair and unjust., and I hope that the feeling of the people of Australia when they hear of this will be so evidenced that the Government will re-consider its decision and seek some other way out of the difficulty rather than penalize a deserving section of men to whom we owe a great debt for the service they have rendered to their country. </para>

                            <para>- It has been pointed out during the course of this debate that there is a danger that this rationing will lead to inefficiency in our defence force. I can well understand its having that effect. A diminution of enlistments does not mean that there should be a diminution of staff. The same staff may be required to supervise and control a smaller body of men. I think the Minister understands that. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind.  I do not want the Minister to put words into my mouth that I have not uttered. Honorable senators of the Op position have no desire to dismiss anyone. It is, however, intolerable that one section of the community- a section that has served .the country well, but has no means to .protect itself - should have to bear the whole burden, while others in "cushy" jobs, using words that I heard used this afternoon, work full time. The men who are now being rationed have not had the advantage of drawing overtime pay; yet they are the first section of the Public Service on whom this penalty of rationing is visited. I hope that the Government will re-consider the position. </para>

                        <para>,- I endorse what other honorable -senators have said about the wonderfully valuable service rendered to Australia, not only during the war, but since then by the specially trained men who are now to be specially penalized. The very fact that 77 per cent, of the required number of enrolments under the voluntary enlistment system has been obtained is due to their efforts and ' also to. the enthusiastic way in which men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> have worked to induce loyal young fellows to volunteer for military training. I do not think that there has been any enthusiasm on the part of members of the present Government to assist these gentlemen in obtaining recruits. </para>

                            <para>- The annual average pay of members of the Permanent Military Forces is Â£303, whereas in the civilian department it is Â£362. There is no suggestion that in the clerical division there should be rationing or dismissals, but the salaries of the soldiers who, during the war and since, have done wonderful service for their country are, by the rationing system, reduced by over 13 per cent. I cannot help asking: "Is it because the soldiers are not unionists and have not the protection which the clerical staff have through the Arbitration Court?" Temporary assistance in Government departments costs Â£428,000 a year. . There are 28,000 public  servants, and the salaries of the Public Service entail an expenditure of over Â£10,000,000 per annum. If the Government is anxious to economize it could save very much more than the Â£60,000 which it expects to save by rationing among the defence staff. A half day's holiday without pay to each civil servant would effect a saving of Â£100,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking very briefly. I have been waiting all the afternoon to speak. No section of the community in Australia is paid higher wages than the civil servants. I am not blaming them. It is their good luck if they can get good salaries. Rut when they are not rationed even to the moderate extent I have indicated, which would mean much more than the Â£60,000 the Government expects to save by rationing the soldier members of the defence staff, I cannot help thinking that the Government's policy amounts to one of victimization of returned soldiers. It seems to me that the Government is ruining the defence system. These are hard words but I believe they are true. The Government has scrapped compulsory military training, which' was introduced by a Labour Government for the good of the country and every trainee. </para>

That was during the regime of the previous Government, supposedly more sympathetic with the forces than the present Government. A statement has been made about the application of a system in the Public Service described as musical chairs. It has been said that in the event of a senior officer going on holidays every officer below him steps up and gets extra pay. The fact is that no officer draws extra pay until he has been doing additional work for 26 days, which means practically a full month. A full month's leave of absence may thus be enjoyed by a higher officer before a lower officer who is filling his office draws the higher rate of pay. These facts were suppressed by honorable senators opposite. </para>

The CommissionerGeneral for Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Herbert Brookes),</inline> some few months ago, in bringing under notice an advertisement which had appeared in an American newspaper regarding the vessel, informed the Prime Minister that, during a visit to Washington, he had taken the matter up with the Secretary of the United States of America Law Department, who had subsequently advised that he was bringing the CommissionerGeneral's representations informally to the attention of the Governor of Maryland, in which State the vessel was then being exhibited. The Secretary of the Law Department stated that, in view of the protest made, the Governor might deem it proper to cause the management of the enterprise to discontinue the exhibition, or at least to refrain from advertising it, but added that, while the feelings of Australians in the matter were appreciated, there did not appear to be any other action open to his department. The Commissioner-General stated that, if successful in Maryland, he would make representations to the authorities in any other State to which the vessel might proceed with a view to similar action being taken. The Prime Minister has . asked the CommissionerGeneral to keep the Commonwealth Government advised of any further developments in this matter. </para>

No. Freight on hardwood timber from New Zealand to South Australia is 2s. 6d. per  100 super, feet higher than freight on similar timber from Tasmania to South Australia. As Tasmania ships no softwood to South Australia, no freight rate has been fixed for this class, and transport charges are therefore not comparable. </para>

                <para class="block">My object is to eliminate the words " seed cotton or ". I submitted an amendment to this effect when the bill was in committee on Friday last. A division was taken and my amendment was lost, but since then I have been making further inquiries into the matter, and I think that I am fully justified in trying to have this obnoxious portion of the sub-clause struck out. In addition to the reasons I advanced on Friday in favour of this amendment, I draw attention to the 1926 report of the Tariff Board on seed cotton. This deals with the bounty then proposed, not on cotton lint or cotton yarn, but purely on seed cotton. At page 26, the report states - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In its consideration of this matter the Tariff Board was seised with the importance of making the payment  of any bounty subject to  such conditions as would ensure that any money paid by the Commonwealth Government in that direction shall actually be received by the growers of the seed cotton. </para>
                    <para>The Tariff Board can foresee that  in  the event of a bounty being granted over a long period it is almost inevitable that the Queensland Government, if in its present mind will bring the cotton industry under the Arbitration Act with a view to fixing increased wages. </para>
                    <para class="block">For example, judging by its past action, the Queensland Board of Trade and Arbitration would almost certainly fix 2d. per lb. as the minimum rate for picking seed cotton, seeing that the rate was first adopted and is strongly desired by the Australian Workers Union. At present in many districts cotton-pickers will accept11/2d. per1b., and at that rate earn up to 1 8s. per day. Further, cotton-growers would probably be subjected to a variety of expensive restrictions such as are found in other Queensland awards. </para>
                    <para>The effect of this obviously would be to increase the costs of production with the result that the money paid as bounty by the Commonwealth Government, and which was intended to assist the growers, would go to meet the increased wages, and thus the object which the bounty was designed to achieve would be defeated. </para>
                    <para>For the reasons given the Tariff Board is of opinion that there should be attached to the payment of any bounty such a condition as will effectively prevent State interference with the cotton industry, either in the form of increased wages or railway freights, &amp;c. (except any increase as may be the result of an alteration in the basic wage) during such period as the Commonwealth Government may be supplying funds, through the bounty system, to assist the industry to carry on and develop. In the opinion of the Tariff Board any such interference might vitally prejudice the successful operation of the bounty. </para>

                    <para>will reject the motion. The evidence which the honorable senator wishes to bring under our notice was before us when the bill was under discussion and the matter was debated from every conceivable angle. I submit that it would be an abuse of the Standing Order which permits the recommittal of a bill, if this motion were carried merely because the honorable senator feels that there is a possibility of inducing certain members to alter opinions previously expressed by them. The mere fact that certain evidence was submitted to the Tariff Board in 1926 is not sufficient reason why the bill should be recommitted. It would be impossible for any government to carry on the legislative business of the country, if, after an honorable senator's amendment had been defeated, and he had spent the week-end amusing himself by reading reports of the Tariff Board, he could have a bill recommitted for the purpose of reconsidering that amendment. Unless some better argument than that can be advanced in favour of the motion it should be defeated. </para>

                        <para>- A motion to recommit a bill for the reconsideration of a certain clause is generally moved for reasons which are given, such as the clause having previously been passed in a thin House, or that circumstances having arisen to cause honorable senators to change their views, they should have a further opportunity to consider the matter. Honorable senators must see that a discussion of the proposed amendment on the motion for recommittal would be anticipating the debate in committee, and. would be irrelevant to the motion. </para>

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [8.38].- This bill has attracted more public attention probably than any other measure that has come before the Federal Parliament.

                <para>The long list of communications shows that the bill has aroused considerable interest and strong opposition throughout Australia. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> in moving the second reading of the measure quoted figures relating to the production in, and the value of wheat exported from, Australia. I suggest, however, that those figures do not supply a reason for the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool. They have relation merely to results that have been achieved in Australia without a compulsory pool. The Leader of the Senate said, also, that he felt certain that, with a more scientific method of handling wheat in Australia, better results to the growers would follow. What the honorable senator has to prove is that a compulsory wheat pool would lead to the more scientific handling of the crop. What is meant by scientific methods in relation to the handling of wheat ? Surely it must mean the most effective and economic system. In my view, competition between the voluntary pools and private buyers has proved to be both effective and economic. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> did not attempt to prove otherwise. He went on to say that the establishment of a compulsory pool would do away with the competition between the voluntary pools and private buyers. This, he said, would be a good thing. Surely reasoning of that kind is against common sense. Competition between buyers must be good for the seller, who should be able to exact a higher price for the commodity which he has for sale. The Minister went on to say that there were in Britain only two overseas buying firms and that they fixed prices for all Australian, wheat. I am advised that the honorable senator's statement is incorrect, and that there "are at least three large buying firms in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- A leading member of one of the voluntary pools in Australia has informed me that at least three firms in Great Britain are in active competition for the purchase of Australian wheat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> did not show how the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool would alter the buying position in England. If this bill is passed, I assume there will still be only three wheat-buyers in the Mother Country. Nothing that we can do by way of legislation can alter that fact. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> appeared to believe that in some way the organization of a compulsory pool in Australia would place our wheat farmers in a better position when dealing with the three principal buyers in England. I cannot see how that is possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> then went on to speak of the compulsory wheat pool inaugurated in Australia during the war. I was a member of the Government at the time, and I can assure the honorable senator that the reasons which he gave for the establishment of that pool were absolutely incorrect. I need hardly remind honorable senators of the difficulties that arose with regard to the disposal of our surplus wheat. As they will recall, the -whole of the shipping of the British Empire and of the Allies had been commandeered for war purposes. There were 110 ships available to lift our wheat. As a result, we were unable to get rid of our 1915 crop, and there was every prospect that the 1916 production, as well as later crops, would be on our hands. There was no possibility at all of the wheat being sold. For this reason the Commonwealth and State Governments took the necessary action to establish a compulsory wheat pool, so that, although it was not possible to ship the wheat overseas, arrangements could be made to purchase it from the farmers and give them some return for their labour. </para>

                    PEARCE.That pool was established because it was impossible to sell our wheat owing to the lack of sea transport facilities.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>
                    has also made the discovery that wheat gains by storage, and he has suggested, by some strange process of logic of his own, that the voluntary pools paid the farmer for this added weight, but the private buyers did not. Considering the results of purchases by pools in competition with private firms, it is extraordinary to find that that is not borne out by the facts, and that where in some States they are in competition, private buyers have given higher prices than those given by the pool. In one State, however, the pool has given a higher price than private buyers. It is obvious that both the voluntary pools and private buyers have always taken into consideration, in offering the prices they do for wheat, this question of added weight.
                </para>
                <para>What is meant by the suggestion in regard to regulating the selling of wheat overseas? Has the Government behind this compulsory pooling system the idea that it is going to hold wheat overseas - that it is not going to sell it for a time, but will endeavour to ration the world's market? Is that the idea behind this compulsory pooling scheme ? Is that what the Minister meant when he said that under this scheme we would be in a better position in selling wheat overseas? If that is the Government's intention I remind the Minister that both the United States of America and Canada tried that system and failed dismally with severe repercussions upon their own wheat-growers, and with most disastrous results to their financial resources. The financial resources of the United States of America and Canada are infinitely greater than ours, and we should be fit subjects for a lunatic asylum if we had behind this proposal for a compulsory pool the idea of rationing the world's market for wheat when two such gigantic corporations failed so dismally. I believe that a large number of farmers throughout Australia have been induced to plant larger areas under wheat by reason of the appeal which has been made to them to come to the assistance of the nation by producing more, and so assisting to adjust our adverse trade balance. Quite apart from that I believe it is desired to give every possible encouragement to those engaged in wheat-growing. Our wheatgrowers produce a commodity which cannot receive any of the benefits of our protective policy. They have to pay the price of protection in this community and at the same time sell their product in the markets of the world. They have to compete with wheat from all other countries, including wheat grown by cheap labour and, in some cases, with black labour, at the lowest wages ruling in the world, and they certainly deserve every consideration and assistance we can legitimately give them. We have had a plethora of bounties, and I understand that there are others looming on the horizon. I contend that if there is one industry in this country which could justifiably be given a bounty on production it is the wheat industry. If the Government really desires to help the farmers and does not want to saddle itself with complications between the States, and between the interests of the States, that will arise under this proposal, the best course for them to follow is to withdraw this bill and introduce a measure providing for the payment of a bounty on the production of wheat, at any rate for this year. Before I  conclude I propose to move an amendment in that direction to the motion now under consideration, but I sb all not discuss it further at this juncture. </para>
                <para>The significant fact in connexion with the scheme which we are considering is that a guaranteed price has been fixed for one year, but the proposed compulsory pool is to remain in operation for three years. The reason given is the necessity to encourage the production of wheat in Australia. There is no doubt that a guaranteed price will .encourage production; but I submit a compulsory pool is not an encouragement. We could have a guaranteed price or a bounty on the production of wheat without a compulsory pool. If it is the sole desire of the Government to give encouragement to the growers of wheat a compulsory pool is not required - and if that is the sole motive the bill should be 'withdrawn and a bounty bill substituted. Moreover, a bounty of 3d. a bushel on wheat Would represent a sum of money equal to that which the Government contemplated having to find in paying a guaranteed price. It would represent Â£2,000,000 on the average acreage. On the figures which have been submitted as to the probable loss that may be incurred under the guarantee, so far as one can see, under present market prices, the loss would range from Â£2,000,000 to Â£6,000,000. We have no indication from the Government as to how it proposes to make up that amount. We have not been informed whether it proposes to make it up by a grant from revenue or by increasing the price of wheat sold to local consumers, which would mean an increase in the cost of living in Australia. That would be a disaster at this juncture. If a bounty were paid the cost would be spread over the whole of the taxpayers of the community and would not have the same repercussion on the cost of living. In these circumstances the proposal for a bounty is quite as generous as that of the Government and does not possess any of the objections inherent in a compulsory pool. A guaranteed price and a compulsory pool have no connexion whatever. </para>
                <para>Let us consider some of ' the objections to a compulsory pool. There is, in the first place, the financial aspect. Probably at the peak period, when the great bulk of wheat is being harvested' and sold, a credit of ' between Â£20,000,000 and Â£30,000,000 will be required. By a series of questions which I submitted to the Minister, I endeavoured to ascertain the amount of our overdraft at the banks under the compulsory pooling system at the peak period during the war years, but the Government was unable to supply me with the information as the records have been destroyed. Speaking from memory, I think in one year our overdraft at the banks ranged from Â£18,000,000 to Â£20,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Under the existing conditions we have voluntary pools and private buyers in competition with each other. Competition between buyers must be of benefit to the sellers of any commodity. But there is another factor with respect to these private buyers which is of considerable importance to the Commonwealth at present. These private firms which operate in the wheat business in Australia, have considerable financial strength and resources. They are not merely Australian firms but business corporations with foreign connexion, which means that they have at their command considerable sums of money and substantial credits. At present the one requirement of Australia is capital, especially overseas capital, and everything that we can do to bring greater financial resources to our aid should be done. Notwithstanding this the Government is proposing that we shall cut ourselves off from the financial resources and credit possessed by these great wheat-buying firms. I venture to say that as private buyers have in the past dealt with at least 50 per cent, of the Australian crop, it is clear that they must be able to command financial resources or credits to the extent of at least Â£10,000.,000. They could not finance the quantity they handle unless they had such resources at their command. </para>

                    is a supporter has been going around the country, almost accompanied by a brass band, boasting that British and American capital is being attracted to this country by reason of its new protective tariff. Here is a proposal under which the Government will- send out of the country these wheat-buying firms which have at their, command an enormous capital to assist us to finance the wheat crop. It means that if this source is eliminated, Australia will have to provide from its own resources, either through- the Government agency or through the Commonwealth Bank and other banks, Â£10,000,000 more than it had to find last year to finance the wheat crop. In view of the present financial position of the Commonwealth, is that a wise thing to do ? Is it not stupid, indeed mad, to adopt such a course? Ye; that is what is to be done under the pro posed compulsory wheat pooling system. These financial resources will be driven out of the Commonwealth, and they will not be available for the purpose of financing the wheat crop.

                </para>
                <para>An even worse factor which has to be considered is the possible effect of a compulsory pool upon the cost of living. The wheat board to be appointed will have power to fix the price of wheat sold for local consumption. At the conference held in Canberra some time ago, the Minister for </para>
                <para class="block">Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> intimated that the Wheat Board would have the power to fix the price of wheat for local consumption. I ask the Senate to carefully consider Â»what it is doing before it decides to hand over to a body of men not elected by the taxpayers of this country the power to tax the people. The Australian Wheat Board will be elected by the State Wheat Boards, and the State Wheat Boards will presumably, although the bill makes no such provision, be elected by the wheat-growers in the States. The wheatgrowers are a section, but only a small section of the people, and it is proposed to give to that section, through their elected representatives on the Wheat Board, the power to tax the people of this country. Let us consider what that taxation may mean. If there is a loss of 6d. a bushel on the guaranteed price of wheat the board will have the power to fix such a price for local consumption as will cover that loss. This would mean an increase in the price of bread, flour, pollard and bran. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> was speaking he suggested that there would be no increase in the price of bread. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> asked him by interjection where the money was coming from, and I suggested it was coming from the air. Of course it must come from somewhere. Is it suggested that this money is coming out of the pockets of the bakers, or the millers of this community? The only conclusion which we can reach in this connexion is that the additional amount which will have to be made up will undoubtedly increase the cost of living. </para>
                <para>Let us examine the position. The exports of Australian wheat in recent years ranged from 53,000,000 bushels in 1927-28 to "103,000,000 bushels in 1924-25. Let us assume that the export of wheat this coming season is 75,000,000 bushels - a very conservative estimate - and that there is a loss of 6d. a bushel. In that event no less than Â£1,875,000 would have to be made up from somewhere. If there is a loss of ls. a bushel on that quantity a loss of Â£3,750,000 will have to be met. The Com- . monwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> shows the local consumption of wheat for food purposes at about 30,000,000 bushels. If a loss of 6d. a bushel on export is to be made up on the wheat sold for local consumption, the local price will have to be increased by ls. 3d. a bushel; but if the loss on such wheat is ls. a bushel, the wheat for local consumption will have to be sold at 2s. 6d. a bushel above the world's price. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> consumption of wheat in Australia is five bushels a year. A loss of 6d. a bushel would necessitate a charge of 6s. 3d. on every member of the community. If the loss were ls. a bushel, the amount to be made up would be 12s. 6d. per head of the population. In other words, a family comprising a' man, his wife, and three children would have to meet an annual charge of Â£1 lis. 3d. to meet a loss of 6d. per bushel, or in the case of a loss of ls. per bushel Â£3 2s. 6d., which is equivalent to a tax of ls. a week on wages. That is the power we are asked to hand over to a body that is not representative of the people of Australia. If that is followed by an increase in the cost of living, our economic difficulties will also be increased. The cause of our economic difficulties is the high cost of production. Unless that cost can be reduced there can be no rehabilitation of industry. </para>
                <para>A bounty on wheat is not open to any of those objections. A compulsory pool will not be so effective as is the present system. I make that statement advisedly as a result of our experience of compulsory pools. I was a member of the Government in power after the war, and I know that there was a tremendous clamor from every State to end the compulsory wheat pool. That clamour did not arise from the wheat-buying firms alone, but from practically every section of the community. It arose because of the abuses that had sprung up in connexion with the compulsory pool. Those abuses led to general dissatisfaction, with the result that the people practically demanded that the compulsory wheat pool should cease. </para>
                <para>The compulsory pool scheme, as set out in this bill, will operate unfairly as between the States. Western Australia, a big producer and a small consumer of wheat, will probably have to bear a loss of Â£500,000. The following statement gives the position of the several States on an estimated loss of 6d.  a bushel on wheat, 3d. to be borne by the Commonwealth and 3d. by the States :  - </para>

The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 10th May, 1930, contains a criticism of the proposed compulsory wheat pool by Professor CoplandInterviewed concerning the Commonwealth Government's proposals for a guaranteed price for wheat and a compulsory wheat pool, Professor D. B. Copland, dean of the faculty of commerce in the University of Melbourne, stated that it was a mistake to link up assistance to the wheat industry with such drastic changes in the marketing of wheat. </para>

                    <para>Under the compulsory pool it would be possible to fix an Australian price to meet the cost of the guarantee of 6d. a bushel. Assuming a crop of 160,000,000 bushels, of which 16,000,000 were held back for seed and other purposes, and 32,000,000 used for local consumption, it would be necessary to increase the local price by 2s. 3d. a bushel to pay6d. a bushel on the 144,000,000 bushels sold. </para>
                    <para>This scheme had been frequently mentioned in recent discussions on the wheat industry, and it was merely an application of the Paterson butter scheme to wheat. There were two very objectionable features to" any such arrangement. First, the increased local price for wheat would be passed on to the consumer, through the price of bread, and an increase in the cost of living would follow. This again would be reflected in wage rates, and so all industrial costs would be increased, a contingency most undesirable under present conditions. Secondly, the costs of the arrangement would fall unequally upon the several States. The total cost would amount to Â£3,600,000, and this would be distributed among the States according to the amount of locally produced wheat offered for sale. The States would, however, pay the increased 2s. 3d. a bushel of wheat upon the whole of their local consumption. With a crop of 160,000,000 bushels, he had estimated that the loss to Queensland would be about Â£440,000, and to Tasmania Â£100,000. New South Wales would lose about Â£330,000, and Victoria about Â£60,000, but Western Australia would receive Â£570,000 on balance, and South Australia Â£360,000. These figures were based upon average yields in the States for an estimated crop of 100,000,000 bushels, but they would naturally be altered by a change in the relative yield of the harvests in the different States. The tariff and the Federal Arbitration Court already created inequalities among the States, and a permanent arrangement of this nature would accentuate these inequalities. South Australia and Western Australia were already receiving direct grants, and they would under this scheme get substantial additional assistance, while Tasmania would incur a loss. </para>
                    <para>Inequalities would also be experienced with a bounty or guaranteed price met from the Consolidated Revenue, but they would be less inequitable in their incidence. </para>

                <para>I have no hesitation in saying that the Government has brought forward its proposal to establish a compulsory wheat pool in order to give some effect to that portion of its platform which provides for the socialization of industry. Let us examine the proposal in the light of the experience of other countries.

                        <para>Stalin, Secretary-General of the Communist party, in an article published on the anniversary of Lenin's death, expounded the Soviet Government's decision to abandon the "N.E.P. " (New Economic Policy) in the countryside and proceed with all due energy with the collectivization of peasant holdings and "the extermination of the kulaks (welltodo peasants) as a class," their number being given as approximately 5,000,000. A decree was issued jointlyby the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars empowering local authorities " in districts of mass collectivization " to confiscate the property of the kulaks without compensation in favour of the collective farms, and banish the owners outside the. village or even province. Thousands of families are now being deprived of their belongings and turned out of their homes. All attempts at resistance are punished by arrests or shooting. Nevertheless, according to the Soviet Press, the Government policy is meeting with "fierce resistance" from the despoiled peasants, who prefer to destroy their property rather than hand it over to the State. Particularly pronounced is the opposition to the collectivization of live stock. In spite of stern government measures wholesale slaughter of cattle and horses is going on, including pedigree stock, so that some districts have been depleted of nearly 50 per cent, of their live stock. The process of collectivization, however, is developing far more rapidly than was anticipated. According to the latest returns of the Commissariat for Agriculture, on 10th February, over 45 per cent, of the total peasant holdings in Russia proper, the Ukraine and " White " Russia, covering, an area of 7,000,000 hectares of arable land, and 70 per cent, of the live stock were collectivized. The Government is now faced with the problem of organizing the work of the millions of peasants involved in the collective farms. The scheme now being drawn up is based not on the principle of proportionate ownership or cooperation, but virtually on that of hired labour, the idea being to divide the population in categories with either fixed wages or payment for piece-work. This policy, according to the Soviet press, is being extensively taken advantage of by various "obscure elements, marauders and counterrevolutionaries " for spreading rumours of a return to serfdom, and the legend of the advent of a " Red master " appears to be widespread. </para>

                    <para>It has been apparent for some time that any attempt to understand what is going on in the Soviet Union in terms of foreign and domestic policy, or to catch the temper of Russian opinion, must use as a point of departure the momentary success of the five-year programme. No single fact in Russian current history compares with this in importance. At first the peasants rebelled sporadically throughout the country districts, and the Government abandoned its coercive measures against them in the interests of harmony. Professor Furniss points out the results of the first year of the five-year programme, Which is just now becoming -known, and accounts for the peasants' change of attitude. </para>

                <para class="block">It gives the figures which Professor Furniss has supplied, and, after dealing with the industrial side, speaks of the agricultural position as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In agriculture, the programme calls for a moderate increase in total crop, a cautious extension of the State farm system and the system of peasant collectives, and some extension of the cultivated area. Recognising the great hazard involved in any attempt to hustle the peasants out of their stubborn notions of private property and their antiquated methods of cultivation, the Communist leaders had only partial confidence in the success of this part of their programme, but the record of achievement lias far outstripped their hopes. </para>
                    <para>This year's crop, despite bad weather conditions, exceeds last year's by 4,000,000 tons, and is equalled only by the bumper crop of 102G. The seeded area has increased by 13,000,000 acres; 45,000 tractors arc in use throughout the country districts, as compared with 500 at the time of the revolution, and 30,000 more are to be added during the next few months. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps the most spectacular development has been the spread of State and collective farms. The number of collectives has doubled during i;he year, and now embraces 1,000,000 peasants.' households, representing in some cases whole villages, or even groups of villages, who have pooled their land and machinery in a co-operative undertaking in agriculture. These collectives furnished 12 per cent, of the commercial grain. The State farms have experienced a similar process of growth. Fifty-five enormous farms, owned by the Government and operated with scientific agricultural methods by Government employees, were established during the year, and sixty-five more will be added during the next few months. These farms have a double purpose. They are the beginning of socialization in agriculture, and "are also experimental stations in modern agriculture technique. </para>

                <para class="block">The only comment I wish to make on the success of that scheme is that, under the ineffective, .out-of-date and reactionary administration of the Czars, Russia produced 28 per cent, of the world's export trade in wheat, whereas, under this magnificent, successful, so-called collec tivization scheme for the socialization of the wheat industry of Russia, it has produced only 3Â£ per cent. of the world's wheat exports. We have the first step now being taken towards the collectivization of the agricultural industry of Australia. A compulsory wheat pool means the socialization of the buying, and selling of wheat. Once the wheat-growers, attracted by the bunch of carrots, in the shape of a guaranteed price, have put their neck in that noose for three years, the Government of the Commonwealth, with the socialization of industry as its declared objective, has the farmers absolutely in its grasp, and can then proceed as in Russia to the ultimate objective of collectivization. </para>
                <para>It is generally assumed that if we pass this bill we are only giving the farmers an opportunity to determine this matter for themselves, but there is no provision in this bill for the taking of any ballot of any farmers in any State. It is true that we hear statements made by Ministers that "it is understood" that the ballots will be taken and that certain States have legislation dealing with the matter. But so far as the Federal Parliament is concerned no farmer will be given an opportunity to say by his vote whether he will or will not come under this scheme. Even if the farmers are given votes in the States under State legislation and three of the six States by a majority decide to enter the pool, although their votes may represent a negligible proportion of the total votes in Australia, they will have the right to bring the other three States into the scheme. It is a most extraordinary proposal. If Tas, mania, Queensland, and Victoria, by a majority, agree to accept the scheme, what right have they to fix the condition!* for the other three States in which tbÂ» total number of wheat-growers may be more than double that majority of wheat-growers who vote for the scheme in Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria?  Under this bill the wheatgrowers of the enormous States of Western Australia, New South Wales, and South Australia - enormous from a wheat-growing point of view - are brought into the pool whether they want it or not, and their wheat is socialized; because the Commonwealth Government has the power to prohibit the export of wheat except under the terms of the hill. As I say, it is an extraordinary proposal, one of the most extraordinary that has ever been brought forward in this Parliament, and I venture to say that the Senate, if it is what it was intended to be - the guardian of the rights of the States - will not allow the measure to pass in its present form. </para>

                <question>An Instructive Discussion at the National Convention. </question>
                <answer>At the National General Convention, last month, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. E.</inline> F. Canning moved and carried a motion that " The cost of wheat should regulate the price of bread." The discussion brought out many details that proved very informative and interesting to a large audience. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Canning</inline><inline font-style="italic">prefaced her remarks by saying that, in her opinion, the price of bread was out of all proportion to the cost of wheat and that bread should be cheaper to the consumer.</inline><para>TheCase for the Bakers. </para><para>Among the delegates to the convention was </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederick</inline>Reed, of Croydon, a master baker of long experience and high standing in the trade. He explained the position from a different viewpoint, taking his hearers back ten years, when the Profiteering Prevention Court fixed the price of bread at63/4d. per 2-lb. loaf for cash. The price of flour then was from Â£19 7s. Cd. to Â£21 2s. 6d. a ton - an average of Â£20 5s. a ton. Since then, he declared, <inline font-style="italic">the price of bread has been fixed to accord with the decision of that court.</inline></para><para>The variations have been influenced by changes in the price of flour, wages, altered working hours, payment for holidays, workmen's compensation, child endowment, and costs incidental to increased prices of goods used other than flour. For instance, whereas in 1921 bakers' wages were Â£5 3s. 6d. a week of 441/2 hours and carters' Â£4 17s. for 54 hours, they now are respectively paid Â£6 8s. 6d. for 44 hours and a week's holiday on full pay and Â£5 8s. 6d. for 48 hours and a fortnight's holiday each year. </para><para>In 1926 the Lang Government passed the Day Baking Act, and this again inordinately increased the price of bread. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed</inline>further stated that from 1921 to 1930 the price of flour had been reduced by Â£8 15s. a ton. In the same period the reduction of1d. a loaf was relatively equal to Â£5 10s., but the increase in wages and alterations in conditions involving expense were equivalent to another Â£3 5s. 6d. a ton of flour. There was, therefore, a comparative loss to the baker, even though only a small one; but as carters' wages have since been reduced by 2s. 6d. a week a drop of 10s. in the price of flour will enable bakers to charge a farthing a loaf less, and they admit that now they have a slight advantage. </para><para>Referring to the companies quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Canning, Mr. Reed</inline> said he had positive information that one of these did not average more than 61/2 per cent, in dividends, while another bread-making firm, it was well known, lost Â£7,000 during the year ended, 30th June last. </para><para>In conclusion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed</inline> said that the actual manufacturing cost of bread was 3.04d. per 2-lb. loaf, plus 1.88 per loaf for delivery, .33 per cent, for rent of bakehouse or interest in lieu thereof, making a total of 5Jd. per loaf. And he added : " Surely 5}d. cannot be regarded as exorbitant, particularly when it is known that a discount has to be allowed to institutions, colleges, &amp;c." " Bread can," he declared, "be purchased in Sydney at less than cost." </para><para class="block">These figures will bear examination, and I hope that those honorable senators who propose to use the argument to which I have referred will rebut them, if they can. I have said that in my judgment this scheme should be examined as if we were an economic committee. I propose to make another and final quotation. It is from one of a series of articles published by Professor Copland in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st May last. Dealing with the subject of wheat marketing, he said - </para><quote><para>What, then, should be the measure of relief afforded to wheat-farmers at the present time? The first and simplest method is to allow the exchange rate to rise to its " natural " level. Every increase in exchange would give an additional bounty to exporters, and wheat producers would thus be relieved of some of the disparity between costs and prices. Secondly, the Government might announce that it was prepared to grant assistance without disturbing the prevailing marketing methods. This could be done in the following way: - Let the pools and merchants proceed with the marketing of wheat in the usual manner. If on the completion of the sale of the wheat the pools showed a return to the farmers of 3s. 9d. a bushel the bounty payable to all growers, whether members of pools or not, would be 3d. a bushel. The Government might give such assistance to a maximum of Gd. a bushel, and any favorable movement in prices or freights would reduce the bounty required. Such a proposal has many advantages. It maintains the present marketing methods without favour to pools or merchants and without disturbance of prevailing financial arrangements; it avoids the necessity of making a doubtful experiment in compulsory pooling; it reduces both the inequalities among the States and the indirect economic effects to a minimum; it eliminates the need for an artificial Australian price; it is a temporary measure, because it involves taxation; and it keeps down the financial assistance to the minimum required in the circumstances. Alternatively it is open to the Government to offer a straight-out bounty of not more than 6d. a bushel. </para></quote><para>I have not by any means exhausted all that may be said regarding the bill. I have expressed my individual views; other members of the Opposition must speak for themselves. If the motion for the second reading of the bill is put to the Senate I shall vote against it, but I wish to have an opportunity of testing the opinion of honorable senators on the desirability of a bounty as against a guaranteed price for wheat and a compulsory pool. In order to do that, I move - </para><quote><para>That all the words after the word "That" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words : - " in the opinion of the Senate, in order to give definite encouragement to the growing of wheat, and to avoid the disadvantages and difficulties of a compulsory pool, the bill should be withdrawn, and a bill be introduced providing for the payment of a bounty up to an 'amount not exceeding 6d. per bushel on all wheat of the 1930-1931 crop of f.a.q standard, delivered at prescribed points of delivery within the Commonwealth. </para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3183</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate></electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon *W Kingsmill</name></talker><para>- Since the Leader of the Opposition announced that he intended to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill, I have consulted the authorities on this matter, and have decided that I cannot accept the amendment proposed by him, for the reason that it is not in conformity with the Standing Orders or parliamentary practice.

I have listened attentively to the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and I must confess that I am rather surprised at the manner in which he put forward one of them. He referred to the "bugbear of socializaton", but I do not consider that this measure is socialization in any form. The principle that it involves is purely cooperation, which is very different from socialization. Movements of this description are made, . not only by the farmers, but also by the representatives of " big business " throughout the world, who have combined to fix prices and have gone a long way in the direction proposed by this bill, which is designed to give the farmers a voice in the fixing of the price of their product. I hear nothing about the bugbear of socialization with regard to " big business " ; but when the farmers endeavour to obtain the benefits of organization, the cry of socialization is raised. If I thought the present proposal would result in the socialization of the wheat industry, I should have nothing to do with it, and I am sure that the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and others of my party who supported the bill in another place, would not have done so if they had had such a fear. In order to become effective, 'this scheme must be passed, not only by this Parliament, but also by the State Parliaments, and a majority of the wheatgrowers in at least three States must agree to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> mentioned that the provision for a ballot of the growers was not in the bill. I. am, however, satisfied that it will be observed. The question whether it should be inserted in the measure may be considered when the bill is in committee. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3184</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HAYS, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator Herbert Hays</name></talker><para>-  It is important. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3184</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6I</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAPMAN, John</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>- I agree with the honorable senator ; but, as I have said, I am satisfied that a ballot of the growers will he taken. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3184</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HAYS, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator Herbert Hays</name></talker><para>-  Under what authority ? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3184</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6I</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAPMAN, John</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>- Under the State authorities. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3184</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KN7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GUTHRIE, James</name><name role="display">Senator Guthrie</name></talker><para>-  Nevertheless, the provision should bp in the bill. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3184</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6I</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAPMAN, John</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>- The bill is in keeping with a number of other marketing acts which have been passed by this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said  that this measure would give the farmers, through their organizations, the right to fix the price of. wheat for local consumption and in that way to levy a tax upon the general community. I remind the right honorable gentleman that the former Government, of which he was. a member, pioneered this principle in certain legislation which it passed. For example, clause 18, which prohibits the export of wheat without licence, is identical in its terms with section 14 of the Dairy Produce Control Act, with section 13 of the Dried Fruits and the Canned Fruits Export Control Acts, and also with a section in the Wine Export Control Act. The powers conferred on the Wheat Board in clause 18, which relates to the interstate trade in wheat, are similar to the powers given to the dried fruits industry in 1928 by the Bruce-Page. Administration. Under the act the growers of dried fruits, through their organization are entitled to obtain art agreed upon price . for all dried fruits marketed in Australia. For years our farmers have been. asking that prices of the commodities which they use should be reduced. Legislation has increased prices. The manufacturers, through legislation, are enabled to get an Australian price for their goods, the workers get Australian rates of wages, and if the farmer cannot get costs reduced,, surely he is entitled to get what others get - an Australian price for his product. Are they to be denied the treatment meted out to other sections of the community? </para></talk.start></continue><para>A good deal has been said in . this debate about compulsion. It has been objected that the farmers should not be compelled to market their wheat through the proposed pool. As a matter of fact, the principle of compulsion is to be found in practically the whole of our Commonwealth and State legislation. The people are compelled to obey. For example, the land-holder is compelled to destroy rabbits, to rid his property of noxious weeds and to do many other things', and in South Australia he is required to make a contribution towards the maintenance of district hospitals without his consent being asked. </para><para>This proposal for the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool will be decided by the vote of the farmers themselves. I amprepared to abide by their decision. I have to confess that in recent years I have been driven to the conclusion that, because of the trend of world events, a compulsory wheat pool for the orderly marketing of the surplus Australian wheat, is. inevitable and desirable. On every hand we see powerful organizations oversea. We read of the operations of the steel trust, the chemical combine and many other huge business concerns. The oil trust comprises three great organizations which, while, they fight for supplies and territories for distribution, have an agreement as regards prices. The same business development is to be seen in importing countries. </para><para>In his well-known publication, <inline font-style="italic">The Bread of Britain.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> H.

Every industry shows a tendency towards concentration and rationalization. The flour milling industry is one of those in which an accelerated tendency towards concentration has shown itself in Great Britain. The pace reminds one rather of heavy industry combinations in Germany and the United States. . . . Hence, we may easily expect that the aggregation of large capital will manifest itself in its full monopolistic form in the flour-milling trade. We may soon expect, therefore, - that the 80 per cent, concentration of flour trade will be realized. </para></quote><para class="block">It is obvious that if there is efficient organization among the buyers and no organization of wheat-growers, the primary producers in all countries will suffer severely. </para><para>On page 50 of his book, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurst</inline> states that in France two gigantic milling units are extremely powerful and dominate the situation, and that as the other countries of Europe are becoming industrialized the process is being accelerated. </para><para>To show how the wheat farmers in Australia were treated by the merchants prior to the war and before voluntary pools were operating in competition with them, I purpose quoting from a report of a royal commission, appointed by the Government of South Australia in 1908, to inquire into the position of the industry in that State.

It contains facts which will astonish you. </para></quote><para class="block">That was circulated among the members of the Federal Parliament and State Parliaments and wheat-growers with the idea of influencing votes, and many of the arguments which it contains were used by honorable members in another place. It contains a statement relating to the wartime Government pooling losses to this effect: - </para><para>Appalling Losses. </para><para>The real administration of the pools was carried out by the State wheat boards, comprised, for the most part, of civil servants. </para><para class="block">In dealing with the statement of losses it is not mentioned that the wheat merchants were the handling agents and cannot avoid their responsibility in this respect. The circular, which was issued with the intention of influencing the farmers and politicians whose votes will eventually decide this important issue, continues - </para><para class="block">A Political Sale. </para><para>The wretched story does not end there. In July, 1919, owing to pressure from the growers' representatives on the Australian Wheat Board, Prime Minister Hughes Bold 56,000,000 bushels to the British Government at 5s. 6d. f.o.b. The growers' representatives had insisted on him selling even at 5s. </para><para>At the very time the wheat was sold, grain experts knew that the 1,250,000,000 bushel crop forecast in the United States of America would not yield within 300,000,000 bushels of that estimate. European crops, then maturing, too, were also suffering appreciable damage. A world shortage was then not only imminent, but inevitable. But politicians like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did not know this, nor did the growers' representatives on the board. They knew nothing of grain marketing, which is a highly specialized job. Within a month of that big, hasty, political sale at 5s. 6d. wheat was worth over 8s. f.o.b. - the difference involving a monetary loss of Â£7,000,000 to Australian growers, or about Â£1,750.000 to South Australian growers. </para><para class="block">I have read criticisms of that statement by honorable members in another place, but the most effective reply was given in the <inline font-style="italic">Liberal Leader</inline> of July, 1919, the official organ at that time of the Liberal party in South Australia. It reads - </para><quote><para>The announcement early this month that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> on the eve of his departure from Great Britain, had effected the sale of 1,000,000 tons of wheat to the Imperial Government at 5s. 6d. per bushel, f.o.b. at Australian ports, was received with the keenest satisfaction. Two further parcels of 500,000 tons each have been placed under offer at the same price, and it is to be hoped that the sale for these, too, will be completed at an early date. A satisfactory feature of the big sale is that the responsibility for securing the freight is again accepted by the British Government. </para></quote><para class="block">Further, the <inline font-style="italic">Liberal Leader,</inline> speaking of this sale of wheat at 5s. 6d. a bushel, said -  </para><quote><para>Prior to the sale being effected, statements by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. A. Watt)</inline> and the  chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> were pessimistic, and gave little promise of a satisfactory realization of the unsold surplus. America is expecting a yield of 1,200,000,000 bushels of wheat this year,, which would exceed the previous record by about 200,000,000 bushels; </para><para>Canada anticipates the huge crop of 325,000,000 bushels; while Argentina has about 9,000,000 tons of grain awaiting shipment. Accordingly, there was no commercial demand for a large portion of the Australian surplus at an acceptable price to local growers. And although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is deserving of the utmost credit for this achievement - which is a fine consummation of the distinguished services he has rendered to Australian interests at the Peace Conference - it is obvious that the latest purchase by the Imperial authorities is a sympathetic one, and can only be regarded as a practical appreciation of the wonderful work of Australian troops on the battlefields of Gallipoli, France, and Palestine. </para></quote><para class="block">My remarks as recorded in the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at that time show that the <inline font-style="italic">Liberal Leader</inline> was edited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> S.

I have witnessed some very keen political struggles in this chamber which have always been fair and aboveboard; but I do not think propaganda of the type which I have quoted is a fair way of influencing the farmers or members of this legislature. In these circumstances I feel it my duty to state exactly what has happened. I propose to show the different treatment which the farmers may expect under the proposed compulsory pool as compared with that which they received from the merchants at the end of the previous compulsory pooling system. The merchants wished to end the pooling system. Many people, knowing that finance was not normal, wanted the pool continued for another year. - Farmers' committees were formed throughout South Australia to bring about the termination of the compulsory pool. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> H. Webb, who is a grain buyer, was  chairman  of those committees. Two other prominent members were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> AAnthoney and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McEwin.</inline> The secretary, <inline font-style="italic">pro tern,</inline> was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> S. Alford, a brother of the manager of Dreyfus and Company. After those committees were established in South Australia an advertisement appeared in the Melbourne newspapers calling a meeting of farmers at Scott's Hotel for the purpose of ending the compulsory pool. Only three farmers attended that meeting. It is significant that Messrs. Webb, Anthoney and McEwin were staying at Scott's Hotel at that time. A representative of <inline font-style="italic">The Farmers Advocate</inline> asked for a report of the meeting, and, later, it published a statement that it had been informed that, owing to the poor attendance, nothing formal had been done excepting that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Berrett</inline> had been appointed secretary, <inline font-style="italic">pro tern,.</inline> Later, it was found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Berrett</inline> was an agent for Dreyfus and Company at Quambatook. Notwithstanding that practically no business was done at the meeting, a couple of days later the manifesto of the Victorian Farmers Committees was published. In view of the facts I have mentioned, we can safely assume that that manifesto was notdrawn up by the farmers of Victoria. That manifesto occupied one column an the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> gave it three-quarters of a column. </para><para class="block">A large sum must have been spent in Victoria in propaganda and in forming these so-called farmers' committees. Subsequently, the compulsory pool came to an end. Had it. not been for the voluntary pool, Dreyfus and Company would have secured a very big grip of the Victorian wheat crop. </para><para>I wish now to refer to a report of the Victorian Royal Commission on wheat which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of October, 1912 - </para><quote><para>Mr.Rees, M.L.C., who has just returned from South America, placed some interesting evidence before the Wheat Commission yesterday relative to the growing and marketing of wheat in the Argentine Republic. , The elevators were leased to practically two people. There wore only two really great firms operating wheat in South America, namely, Dreyfus and Company, and Bunge and Bourn. The firm of Dreyfus and Company was already operating in Melbourne. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rees</inline>went on to show the danger of the wheat market in Victoria becoming controlled by two or three firms. He said - </para><quote><para>One of the biggest operators in the world was already here, and had been established here for two years. The other firm, Messrs. Bunge and Bourn, would be here shortly, and when the two operators were on the scene it would be a bad lookout for the merchants who were in Australia at present. </para></quote><para class="block">On page 18 of his book, <inline font-style="italic">The Bread of Britain,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurst</inline> gives some interesting information regarding the position in the Argentine to-day. </para><para>The Argentine, or, rather, the River Plate country, is another great source of British bread supplies. The entire situation there has now become concentrated in the hands of two gigantic international firms, one of Belgian nationality and the other French. Competition is offered, to some extent, by. another French firm and by a German concern, but the first two firms are known to control from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of the average export of wheat of -the country. Despite the fact that, prior to the war, England had placed more capital in the Argentine than all others combined, it did not find its way into the grain business. Here, too, the British bread supply is subject to concentrated' organizations which are not in British hands. These often work in concert. </para><para class="block">Lord Beaverbrook recently referred to the position of wheat in the Argentine. In the following letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Montreal Herald</inline> Lord Beaverbrook exposes the fallacy of cheap wheat giving cheap bread :  - </para><quote><para>In your leading article of 18th October you put a direct question to me. In the course of this article you ask - " If there were a tax on foreign grown wheat, would the English buyers be compelled to pay the price demanded by the Canadian Wheat Pool? If they did, could Lord Beaverbrook maintain his position that England's supply of food would not rise in price?" </para><para>I still hold to my declaration, for the following reasons: - </para><para>The freetrade market of Great Britain is being flooded with wheat from the Argentine and Germany. </para><para>Wheat is produced in the Argentine at less than 25s. a quarter (3s.11/2d. per bushel),  a  price with which farmers, neither in, Canada nor in Britain, can compete. Further, 340,000 tons of this wheat entered our ports in September of this year. This is ten times the amount imported from the Argentine in September of last year. British imports of Argentine wheat are, therefore, growing rapidly. </para><para>We are also receiving quantities of grain from East Prussia. This wheat is subsidized by the German Government to the extent of 13s. a quarter (1s. 71/2d. a bushel), which enables it to be sold at 40s. to 44s. a quarter (5s. to5s.6d. per bushel), in the English market. This, again, is a price lower than that demanded by the Canadian or British farmers if they are to cover their expenses. </para><para>These are the facts on the wholesale side. On the retail side is the further fact that the quartern loaf now costs 81/2-9d. </para><para>But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Fielding, a recognized authority in England on agricultural questions, has shown conclusively that the quartern loaf can be, and has been, profitably sold at not exceeding this figure, even when the wholesale price of wheat advances to 55s. a quarter (6s. 101/2d. a bushel). </para><para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> is right, and there is no doubt of that, how is it that the loaf is now sold in London at 9d., when the wholesale price of Prussian wheat is 40s. to 44s. a quarter (5s. to 5s. 6d. a bushel), or when the cost of production of Argentine' wheat is less than 25s. a quarter (3s.11/2d. a bushel). </para><para>The reason is that the middleman is not passing the benefits of low wholesale prices to the consumer. He is mulcting the public, pocketing the proceeds, and growing rich as the result. </para><para>Might I mention further that the three firms most concerned -with the sale of Argentine wheat in Britain are respectively French, Belgian, and Dutch. </para></quote><para class="block">In order to influence members of Parliament, as well as the wheat-growers of Australia,- a great deal has been said regarding the failure of the Canadian wheat pool. That pool controls about 60 per cent, of the wheat produced in Canada and has about 140,000- members. It is estimated, that in February, 1930, that pool held 148,000,000 bushels of wheat. Honorable senators know - that there is a world surplus of wheat; We are told that in the Chicago wheat pit, the total transactions in wheat are many times greater than the actual production of wheat. Let me again quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hurst's</inline> hook to show the effect of this speculation on world prices - </para><quote><para>In the United States speculation in wheat is widespread among all classes; in Canada, it is almost a universal obsession among the people, and is comparable only with the gambling on horse-racing in Great Britain.

This single day's open position represents 58 weeks' import requirements of the United Kingdom. In other words, the open commitments on a single day in Chicago alone represent about thirteen and a half months' bread requirements of 50,000,000 people of Great Britain and Ireland. We may say that the 200,000,000 bushels imported by Great Britain in the course of a year represents merely one fortyfifth of the future transactions per annum in Chicago alone, without regard to those in other markets.

Combinations of capital are formed to depress values and bear down prices. There is also combination and speculation to get a profit as between the legitimate wheat grower and the consumer of wheat. In regard to Canadian wheat, I ask what would have happened to world's prices if the 148,000,000 bushels held by the Canadian pool in February, 1930, had been thrown on the market regardless of price. Speculators would also have sold, thus breaking the market, in which case, Australia would have received many millions less for her wheat. The Canadian pool acted in the interests of the farmers. It realized that it would not be wise to dispose of the wheat it held regardless of price. The provincial parliaments of the great wheat-producing States of Canada supported the pool. The position would have been much worse had the 565,000,000 bushels of Canadian wheat produced in 1928-29 been dumped in the world's market regardless of price. Had that been done, Australian farmers would probably have . received not more than 2s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat. The provincial governments of Canada foresaw that the flooding of the market would mean disaster. </para></talk.start></continue><para>On the 27th February a bill was introduced into the Parliament of the province of Alberta, Canada, to enable the Government to guarantee advances made by the banks to the wheat pool. This action was taken after conference with the governments of the two other wheat-growing provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, both of which were introducing similar legislation. The Premier of Alberta, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brownlee,</inline> explained that the action his Government proposed had become necessary owing to the large holdings of wheat not in the pool, which threatened to endanger the market. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brownlee,</inline> speaking on the first reading of the bill, said - </para><quote><para>The financial position was even more reassuring than we had previously anticipated. As a result of the margins already established by the sale of wheat at substantially higher  prices than 'at present existing, the unsold wheat will have to hesold at considerably less than one dollar per bushel before' any loss can result to the provinces on the guarantees. It will thus be seen that at the lowest price to which wheat has so far declined the guarantee has not been endangered. As a matter of fact, wheat would have to sink to' a level never reached on Canadian markets before the Provincial Governments would suffer any loss. </para><para class="block">Pool not Gambling. </para><para>As the wheat pool has been subjected to the most severe propaganda of an adverse nature since its inception, a word or two might not be out of place to assure the public that a very great part of this propaganda is misleading.

' It should be distinctly understood, however, that the pool is not following a policy of attempting to hold up supplies of wheat. We are still following the same basic marketing policy of previous years, of always offering to sell when there is an actual demand for wheat. While we have not been selling substantial quantities at the present low levels, we have been offering wheat to foreign buyers and domestic mills consistently throughout the present crop season. </para><para>Factors in Situation. </para><para> A number of factors have entered to cause the present depression of wheat prices, notably the huge carry-over of last year's wheat, the unbridled dumping of Argentine wheat on the European market, and just recently the unstable financial situation resulting from governmental investigations of the brokerage business in Canada. The wheat pool has fortunately been in a position to avoid liquidating its wheat upon an unfavorable market. In order to do this and at the same time pay pool members for this year's crop on the basis of one dollar . for No. 1 Northern, we have naturally had to borrow heavily from the banks. The banks have always loaned on the security of our wheat in store. The basis of these loans requires that the value of our wheat security shall always be 15 per cent, greater than the amount of money advanced by the banks. We have always maintained this margin of safety and are doing so to-day. </para><para>During the past ten days an element of uncertainty and weakness has been introduced into the financial situation in ' Canada as result of some of the provincial governments seizing the accounts and books of certain stock and grain brokerage firms. </para><para>Some of these brokerage houses are carrying large, speculative grain accounts on behalf of clients, accounts based on margin payments only. The wheat market reflected the disturbing situation in the brokerage business and wheat prices were unable to pull themselves up to: better levels. There was a possibility of speculative margin-holders of wheat being sold at any minute, which would involve the dumping, on an already weak market, of millions of bushels. </para><para>To prevent such an unfortunate occurrence, the Governments of the various provinces considered the release of these accounts from, the - general seizure, so that the margin accounts of wheat speculators could be negotiated in the customary way. This was done. </para><para>Action of Banks and Governments. </para><para>At this time the Canadian banks became, concerned. They sensed a danger of wheat prices being forced down still lower as a result of the general unrest, and feared that the wheat pool margin of 15 per cent, might be impaired; accordingly the banks, called upon the pools to take some action to insure the maintenance of the margin. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time ' granted.']</inline> I ask leave to continue my remarks to-morrow.

                    <para>. - I desire to mention a matter affecting my honour as a soldier and my position as a senator.. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> is reported to have said' in another place yesterday - " These two gentlemen," he. was referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and myself, "made statements which are entirely, 'incorrect and require a definite reply." The Minister actually did not quote any statement made by me, but went on to say that in Victoria, where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott had been speaking against the recruit-, ing system, the response had been the lowest. Actually, 8,291 recruits have volunteered in Victoria, out of 11,587 asked for under the voluntary system, whereas in Western Australia, where the Minister resides, the total response has been only 1,730. Moreover, if. the Minister had really cared to examine the figures submitted he would have found that in Nationalist constituencies in Victoria, where my influence might be expected to have some weight, the response has been the best, showing, if it shows anything, that my influence has been in favour of recruiting; whereas. in constituencies represented by Labour members, where my influence would not amount to much, the response has been the worst. In fact, I think that the lowest response has been in the constituencies represented by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. Although appeals were made to the municipal councils in those constituencies to call public meetings in aid of recruiting, most of them refused in a contemptuous manner even to consider the matter, and those who replied to the officers who submitted the request gave them a. rude rebuke for venturing to address them on such a subject. Although urgent and repeated requests were made to both those Ministers to address meetings in their constituencies in support of recruiting, they and supporters of the Government have invariably refused to do so. In this matter, of course, they are absolutely consistent; they do not want a defence system. If the Minister for Defence would go into the matter further he would discover that the failure of voluntary enlistment, so far as it has failed in Victoria, is due largely to the misfortune that great and populous constituencies are represented by gentlemen who make it their boast that under no circumstances would they take up arms, even to defend their country or to prevent outrage of their women folk. If those who live in constituencies that return to Parliament gentlemen animated by such sentiments ever joined a defence force, they would be declared " black " by their friends. </para>

                        <para>- If we march troops through those constituencies, they are jeered at, and referred to as "Australia's last hope." The Minister has chosen to attack me; but he should also be aware if he does his job that I myself have gone upon the public platform repeatedly in Nationalist constituencies, where I am welcome, and I have urged that, no matter what the feeling may be regarding the new system of training, our young men should join the service and maintain the forces, so far as the Government will allow, in an effi cient condition. ' The Minister should also know that, although the area under my command includes the constituencies represented by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> and the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and although the recruiting in those centres is the lowest, yet the total percentage of enlistments for the divisional area under my charge is the highest in the State. Part of the failure must be attributed directly to the Minister who has repeatedly broken faith with his officers with regard to the provision of uniforms. In one instance, the troops had been led to expect the issue of kilts, and, in other cases, other ornamental uniform, but they have been humbugged, and, so far, only a few bandsmen have been measured for their new uniform. As I have already said, my only son who was serving as a compulsory trainee joined up as a voluntary cadet, and now, having attained the age of18 years, is a private in the infantry. I challenge the Minister to say whether any member of the Government, including himself, has done more' to help recruiting than I have done, even under his own scheme. The new system has been in force, not for five months, as the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> said this afternoon, but for nearly eight months. During the first two months before Christmas we had our greatest response, because we then had the compulsory trainees under our hand, and were able to make a direct appeal to them. " I now come to what appears to me the real complaint that the Minister has against. me. I understand that he said - </para>

                    <para>The subject of Australian defence is greatly exercising the minds of the most thoughtful of our citizens, but the multitudes who find the latest test match scores of absorbing interest seem to regard defence as entirely a matter to be left to Providence. With a view to arousing some thought on this subject, I invite the undermentioned authorities to answer through your columns the following questionnaire: - </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Then I named <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White, Major-General Coxen, Brigadier-General Dodd and Captain Dyett. The following are the questions that I submitted, and I leave honorable senators to say whether there is anything harmful in them: - 1, Is it a fact that a body of experts after the war laid down that a force of approximately five divisions of infantry and two divisions of cavalry, with their proportion of technical arms, is necessary for the defence of Australia? 2, In round numbers what would be the strength of such a force. </para>
                <para> There is no secret about that question. The Minister himself has given the answer. He has put the number down at 180,000 men. 3, Do you agree that such a force is reasonably necessary for our defence? </para>
                <para class="block">Again the Minister has supplied the answer. He admits that such a force is necessary.  4, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel, in the last report, stated that a nucleus of some 50,000 organized as at the date of such report was the minimum strength of the nucleus that would be required to keep our forces in such a state as would enable them to be mobilized in the event of war.

                <para>In the event of a sudden attack by a hostile force upon, say, the coast of Fremantle, what forces would at present be available to act against them? </para>
                <para class="block">The answer supplied by the. Minister is 1,700 men. </para>
                <para>How long would it take to despatch a. force from the eastern States to reinforce that force, and would it. be desirable and practicable to send any  force  away from Melbourne or Sydney to their assistance? </para>

There is no secret about any of the questions which I raised, and there should be no objection to the experts answering them for the enlightenment of the public. I understand that the Minister, again referring to me, went on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>He is anxious that the great western State should be protected, but he should devote his attention to recruiting in his own State. If he studied the records he would find that the naval depot of Western Australia was the first to get the full quota under the voluntary system, and that, from a military point of view, it is well up in the list; but in the State which he represents matters are not so satisfactory, for which this gentleman is, to some extent, responsible. </para>

                <para class="block">I have pointed out that the total number of enlistments is four or five times greater in Victoria than in Western Australia. I understand that the Minister further said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Council of Defence agreed that 35,000 trainees would be the necessary nucleus, and that 180,000 troops could be quickly called to arms in the event of invasion. That is all that is provided for under the old compulsory system, and such a force, it is considered, would be a sufficient defence against any invading force that could be landed in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> must know all this. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I say that I did not know that the Council of Defence had agreed that 35,000 men was a sufficient nucleus. I was under the impression that that body was not allowed to express any opinion on that point. I certainly did not know that 35,000 trainees would be sufficient to enable 180,000 troops to be raised in an emergency. That statement, is in direct conflict with the report of . <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Chauvel, who said that the 4S,000 or 50,000 troops under arms at the date of his last report was the smallest possible force that could function as a nucleus. I want to know whether he has altered his ideas since the present Government assumed office. I ask the Minister to reconcile those statements, unless that be the case. I should have thought that inasmuch as under the old system the men first called up would be the men who had been discharged, and who were in just as good a condition of training as, or perhaps better than, the men still under arms. Agreater number will now be required in the nucleus than under the old scheme, because the men who would be called up under the new scheme would be raw recruits. Under the old system every man. was- registered, and he knew where he had to go when summoned. Under the present system we do not know what men reside in an area, or where they can be found. The best means of refuting my statement, and. the best way to relieve <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> patriotic anxiety, would be to request the authorities whom I have named to reply to the questions that I submitted. On the Minister's own statement there is nothing secret about the matter, I have the greatest respect for these authorities. If they answer the questions I shall accept their assurance, and cease to ask further questions on this matter. </para>
                <para>The Minister went on to indulge in what ia, in effect, a threat that, if he is in office when my present term of service expires, he will see that it is not renewed. If I have committed any offence, the Minister has ample power to have me dealt with under the Defence Act. Under the Constitution Act it is clear that I am justified in what I have done.Section 44 provides, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that any person holding an office of profit under the Crown shall be incapable of sitting as a senator, but this provision does not apply to the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the military or naval forces of the Commonwealth, by any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth. That is my case. It is clear that when the Constitution was drafted, the position of a military officer . was fully realized. </para>
                <para class="block">Surely the Minister does not contend that it was intended that an officer occupying a place in this Parliament, should be gagged and bound simply because he was not sitting upon the same side of the House as the Minister for Defence. I throw back in his teeth the accusation that I have in any way made use of information derived from my military position. No one could be more scrupulously careful than I have been in that respect throughout my service. I challenge the Minister to substantiate that charge in Parliament or outside. </para>
                <para>I am anxious about the position of Western Australia. It lies nearer than any other State to the path of danger. Under our Constitution the State is forbidden to raise an armed force, even to protect itself, without the consent of the Commonwealth. In this respect our Constitution differs from that of the United States of America where the States control the militia. Does the Minister contend that 1,700 men are ample to protect that great State? It is certain that we could not spare out of this scheme a single man to go to its assistance from the eastern States. </para>
                <para>I propose, at a later date, if the Minister does not allow the officers to reply to these questions, to ask the Senate to appoint a select committee to take evidence from them, so that the public may at least know where they stand in the matter of defence. </para>
                <para>I further deny that I desire to make any political capital out of this matter. To illustrate my own real position, I quote the following report from the <inline font-style="italic">Auckland Weekly News,</inline> of the 11th June, 1930:- </para>

                <para>Steps have been taken during the past fortnight to revive the National Defence League of New Zealand, and this has been accomplished. </para>
                <para>Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Andrew</inline> Russell is  president  of 'the league, and a campaign will shortly bc opened for establishing the organization throughout the Dominion and engaging in educational work. </para>
                <para>It is stated that the movement is receiving widespread support, particularly in view of rumours regarding changes in the defence scheme and the Government's announcement that it hopes to save Â£500,000 this year by cutting down the normal vote of Â£1,000,000 for the naval, air and military forces. </para>
                <para>The constitution of the league provides that the league shall be non-party politically, except that it will oppose any political party which aims at weakening the national defence forces of New Zealand, or which would dispense with the compulsory training system or in any way impair the efficiency of the defence forces. No professionally-paid soldier in the employ of the Defence Department or any other professionally-paid member of the naval, military or air forces can, under any circumstances whatever, be an officer of the league,  and the same restriction applies to shareholders and officials of any ammunition manufacturing company. </para>
                <para>The objects of the league are to maintain a white New Zealand, to secure the immunity of the country from invasion, and to educate citizens upon such measures of defence as may be considered necessary. The. league accordingly advocates universal defensive training, the embodiment of the lessons of the late war in the training systems, the adequate equipment of the defence forces, and the immediate consideration of providing machinery in the dominion for the manufacture of shells, small arms and ammunition, such plants to be Stateowned. The league also seeks the provision of at least two safe harbours for the protection of shipping, the fuller training of territorial officers and N.C.O.'s, and the removal of the control of recruiting of defence forces from the defence authorities and placing it in the hands of a. civil department of State. </para>
                <para class="block">I have placed that report on record to show that a movement is being instituted in New Zealand where the party corresponding to the Nationalist party in Australia is in power, and proposes to take measures on similar lines to those of this Government with regard to the defence system of the dominion. The 'best known general in New Zealand has become president of the League, the object of which is to direct public attention to the situation, so as to prevent the threatened weakening in the defence forces of the country. In what respect does his position differ from mine? I trust that what I have said will be ample refutation of any charge which the Minister has made against me. </para>

                            crave the indulgence of the Senate to reply to a statement which, I understand, was made yesterday in another place impugning my honour, both as a soldier and a member of this Senate. I am informed that I have been accused of conduct unworthy of an officer and a gentleman. I emphatically deny that charge. I thank the Assistant Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline>
                            for his reference to the matter this afternoon. I believe that I was charged with making an incorrect statement. That I deny absolutely. I believe, further, that the Minister's charge concerning me was based on a press report.- I should have thought I would receive treatment such as I would accord to other people. I would no more dream of making a mean and a malicious attack on any man on the strength of a press report than I would do anything dishonorable. Had I been the Minister I would have cut out the press report, sent it to the gentleman concerned and asked him whether or not it was a correct report of his utterances. In that way, I would have given him a chance to justify himself. But I understand another charge was made against me. I believe the Minister alleged that I have been speaking against the voluntary system of enlistment with the object of discouraging it, simply because, so the Minister says, it is proving successful. I wish to God it was successful. Success, like failure, is relative. I regret to say that the voluntary . system is not a success. I dislike having to refer to what I am doing for the military defence of the Commonwealth, because it may savour of self-praise, and is distasteful to me; but Ifeel that, in justice to myself, I must take advantage of this opportunity to state the facts.From the moment that universal training was suspended or abolished, call it what you will, and the voluntary system of enlistment substituted for it, I have done what I could to make it a success. I was one of the first of the citizen force officers at a conference in Melbourne with the second chief of the Imperial General Staff to consider the steps that should be taken to give effect to the Government's policy. I said then that it was our duty, and certainly I considered it my duty, to do all that is possible to ensure its success. I assured him that I would do everything in my power to make the new policy go, and I have carried out that promise to the letter. Since then I have spent a greatdeal of my own time travelling about in my own car, and using my own petrol in order to address meetings, interview business people, and impress upon the people the need for recruits. I have been connected with the defence forces of the Commonwealth for over 30 years. As a youngster of seventeen years, I went into my first camp as a stretcherbearer, in my father's unit, which was established in the 'seventies, when there was a scare about a probable Russian invasion. The cream of the jest lies in the fact that the statements which it is alleged
                            <inline font-style="italic">i</inline>
                            made for the purpose of discouraging recruiting, were made at a meeting of the Old Comrades Association in connexion with the Launceston Volunteer Artillery Corps, an organization that lias an unbroken record for over 70 years. I went to that meeting for the express purpose of enlisting the good offices of that organization to obtain recruits for my unit, and made
                            <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                            special appeal to them to assist with recruiting. T feel, therefore, that the Minister's allegation is contemptible in the extreme. There was never a more rotten lie uttered than that, because I have done all that is possible for me to do to make voluntary enlistment successful, and I shall continue to do so because I wish my unit to be up with the others.

                    <para>It is unfortunate for the gentleman concerned that he should have selected as his target the only three officers on the active list who are members of this Parliament. One officer, a member of another place, commands  the 6th Battalion, and has the highest enlistment in his own State for any infantry unit. Similarly, I have the highest enlistment for any infantry unit in my State and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott has the highest enlistment of any Division in Australia. The attack made upon us in another place on insufficient data, was mean and contemptible. I resent it very much indeed. It is absurd to say that I am annoyed because the voluntary system is proving a success. Much depends upon the view of what constitutes success. I remind honorable senators that the irreducible minimum for all ranks is fixed at 35,000. We were expected to get that number by voluntary enlistment by the end of this month. The figures quoted by the Minister show that we are still a long way off the total - some 8,000  -  and no provision has been made for wastage, which is an important factor and must not be overlooked. In my own little unit in. Tasmania the wastage is considerable. Men get out of employment and have to leave the State, or go to other parts of it. In this way we lose a fair number of our recruits. In every respect we have to fight an uphill battle, and I submit that instead of being accused of unworthy motives, we are deserving of at least consideration if not some praise for what we are doing. It is a hard and thankless task. As I have said, I have been associated with the defence forces for over 30 years, and although I am not weary, I think it is time that others came in to get ready to take my place, and the places of others in positions of responsibility. I feel my position very keenly, and deplore the pitiable ignorance displayed by the Minister in his attack. I regret that a responsible member of this Parliament should go out of his way and, on insufficient data, make,a very mean, contemptible and unjust attack upon me and the other members of this Parliament who are on the active list. </para>

                        <para>. -  We have been informed that, in the main, the principles contained in the Wheat Marketing Bill now before the Senate have received the endorsement of certain State Governments, and particularly the South Australian Government. There was, I understand, some difficulty with the Government which occupied the treasury bench in that State prior to the election held in April last, but on that occasion there was  a  great change in the personnel of the House of Assembly, and a resultant change in the Ministry. We have been informed that the Hill Government wholeheartedly approves of a compulsory wheat pooling system, which is a plank of the platform on which it was elected, and that it will co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in the establishment of an Australian-wide wheat pool. </para>

                        <para>.  - I have no knowledge of any change of policy on the part of the South Australian Government in connexion with a compulsory wheat pool.

I know that the Premier of South Australia is in favour of the pooling system proposed by the CommonwealthGovernment. </para>

                    <para>I presume that the basis of the complaints of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> are that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> has not court-martialled them. Personally, I regret that there has been any necessity for these two honorable senators to ventilate this matter in the Senate. I appreciate the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> and I am sure the Minister for Defence is magnanimous enough to realize that probably the better course for him to have pursued when he saw the report of his remarks was to ascertain if the honorable senator had been correctly reported. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> will admit that if he has been correctly reported, the Minister for Defence would naturally be incensed at the ' tone of his speech, which contained a very strong adjective. The Government and the Minister for Defence have had to submit to strong condemnation in consequence of such reports, but I shall bring under the notice of the Minister what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has said, and I am sure the Minister will be able to straighten out the difficulty. </para>
                    <para>In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott I am afraid that there is no hope. That honorable senator has conceived the idea that this Government does not want any defence system, and has said so to-night. In these circumstances, there is nothing I can do as between the Minister for Defence and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott, but I can perhaps repeat that this Government stands by the word it gave to Parliament. We have said that we want a defence system, and have made up our mind to make the voluntary system of training more efficient that the compulsory system. The honorable senator does not believe that is our desire, and to use a colloquialism, "makes no bones" about that belief, either inside or outside this chamber. I am not concerned with the questionnaire which the honorable senator sent to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and which he suggested should be answered by certain prominent military officers, whom he named. But no one knows better than he does that under the military regulations, no military officer is permitted to answer questions such as he submitted. The average reader of that newspaper  did not know that. The letter was  written,  not in the interests of Australia's defence; but in an endeavour to blacken the Government in the eyes of the Australian public. If the honorable senator is pained by what the Minister for Defence has said, I can only say that he has tonight repeated the statement of which the Minister complained. In effect, he said that this Government is dishonest in its military system, which he contends is hypocritical anda farce. There is only one honorable course for a person holding a position under the Government, for which he receives Â£250 a year, and who makes such statements, and that is to return his commission. If the honorable senator believes that, as an officer, he is assisting us to carry out a sham on the Australian public, he stands condemned as being as dishonest as he contends is the Government which he is serving. Until the honorable senator is prepared to give a practical demonstration of his real feelings, I hope he will keep his quarrels with the Minister for Defence outside the Senate. I respect an honorable senator who acts as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has, and who asks why the Minister did not ascertain whether the report, to which he took exception was correct; but I have no time for one who will make an incorrect statement and deliberately repeat  it,  as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott did, while serving the Government at a salary of Â£250 a year. </para>
