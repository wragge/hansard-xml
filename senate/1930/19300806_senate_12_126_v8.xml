                GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [11.12]. - I am not sure whether senators speaking on this bill or those listening to it are the more deserving of sympathy. The income tax assessment legislation is extremely complicated, and it is most difficult for a layman to know the effect of amending bills. I shall endeavour to conform, as far as practicable, to the practice of dealing only with general principles at the second-reading stage, but the general principles of income taxation are laid down in the principal act, and when speaking on an amending bill one can deal only with those that arc affected by it. The measure is essentially one for consideration in committee, but I desire to direct attention to certain of its provisions now. There have been attempts from time to time to make income tax legislation apply retrospectively, and that doubtful principle is introduced in this bill in an aggravated form. What is the reason for these attempts? Usually they arise in this way : Certain taxation is attempted to be collected, but the taxpayer, acting on legal advice, disputes the legality of his assessment. If the court gives judgment in favour of the appellant, and it is allowed to stand, other taxpayers take advantage of the defect in the law. Accordingly legislation is introduced to block the gap. Where clearly it was the intention of Parliament that certain incomes should be taxable, but taxation cannot be levied upon them owing to some defect in the law as revealed by decisions of the court, no reasonable person would object to an amendment to remedy that. It is reasonable also that in measures dealing with income taxation some retrospective provisions should be found. But the amendments in clause  25  make retrospective to  1922  certain alterations of the income tax law. While I do not intend at this juncture to discuss the bill in detail, I propose to discuss one thing that the Government is endeavouring to do, no doubt on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Taxation. In paragraph c, of clause 2, relating to the definition of income, there is a new definition which will make the provisions of the act, as affected by clause 25, retrospective to 1922. I assume that if this amendment of section 4 is adopted, the commissioner will proceed to re-assess for income tax purposes incomes earned  ms  far back as the year mentioned. Paragraph c defines income as -  any profit arising from the sale by any person of any property acquired by him for the purpose of profit-making by sale, or from the carrying on or carrying out of any profitmaking undertaking or scheme.
            </para>
            <list type="upperalpha-dotted">
                <item label="J.">
                    <para>invito honorable senators to note that the proposed new definition covers practically all forms of trade and commerce, because all trade and commerce is carried on for the purpose of profit-making. This new definition will make it possible for the Commissioner to tax even isolated transactions, such as the profit made on one sale of shares. In four assessments recently received, where each taxpayer had a similar single transaction resulting in a profit on a sale of shares which had been held for eight months, lie taxed one taxpayer on the profit made, but not tin three others. When the assessment was challenged,, the Commissioner claimed the tax, and the matter is still held up. The proposed new definition is objectionable because under it the Commissioner may tax profit on transactions entered into during the year ended 30th June, 1930, which would not be taxable under the principal act. It is objectionable also, because it is thought, to offend against section 55 of the Constitution, in that it attempts to tax profits which are accretions of capital. If such profits are to be taxed, it is only equitable that any loss arising from a single transaction not entered into for the purpose of profitmaking should be allowed as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> set off against income from other sources. </para>
                </item>
            </list>
            <para>The new definition is the thin end of the wedge to tax all profits on re-sale, however casual or isolated. For example, under the law, as proposed to be amended by this bill, profits on re-sale will be levied in respect of the buying and sell ing of a house or a block of land, also on the sale of shares bought in the first place as an investment and sold at a profit under stress of circumstances. It would appear from the explanatory note issued by the Commissioner of Taxation, that this is his intention, because he specifically mentions as justification for the alteration a recent decision in the House of Lords - <inline font-style="italic">Jones</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Leeming, T.L.R.,</inline> page 396  -  against the taxing authority. As I shall have a further opportunity to deal with these retrospective provisions in committee, I do not propose to carry the argument further at this stage. </para>
            <para>The provisions in clause 10 relating to the taxation of private companies is of special importance. Apparently the act is to be applied to any private company that has been formed since 1915. To assess for taxation profits earned by private companies, which in their constitution do not comply with the law as it will be when this amending bill is passed, may be perfectly justifiable for this year; but under this proposed amendment it will be competent for the Commissioner of Taxation to tax all such companies retrospectively to 1915, or the year in which they were formed. We may assume that, acting under the law as it stood, these companies were formed and taxpayers honestly furnished their returns, and that, the Commissioner made his assessments for taxation purposes. I suggest that, when the bill is in committee, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> should give a full explanation of the reasons for the retrospective nature of all these provisions a.nd, if necessary, justify the proposed alteration of the law. I contend also that, a reasonable time limit should be fixed in respect of the retrospective taxation of the private companies to which I have referred. </para>
            <para>Another important provision in the bill, which is also in the parent act, is that relating to the discretion of the Commissioner. Under the existing law. the Commissioner may form a certain opinion and make his decision with regard to returns furnished by a taxpayer, notwithstanding, that the taxpayer may have been acting under legal advice and have furnished full information concerning items which he believed to he properly  taxable. The Commissioner, acting within his discretion, may determine that certain other forms of income are taxable. The Commissioner, it should be remembered, is but one party to a dispute as to what form of income is properly taxable. The other party is the individual taxpayer concerned. Under our existing legislation, if there is a difference of opinion between the person subject to the law and the person administering the law, the former quite properly has the right of appeal to a legally constituted tribunal, whose function it is to interpret the law;  My criticism of this bill is that a number of its provisions - I refer particularly to those affected by clause 2, paragraph (i) ; clause 5, paragraph (q), and clause 10, - this fundamental right of appeal is not recognized.. The exercise of discretion by the Commissioner should be subject to appeal to the court.' I may be told that the protesting taxpayer will have the right of appeal to the Board of Review, but I invite the Minister, in his reply, to inform the Senate what provision in the bill gives the taxpayer an opportunity to appeal even to the Board of Review on a question of fact. I am aware that there will be the right of appeal to the court on a question of law, but there should also be the right of appeal against the facts upon which the Commissioner may have made his decision. </para>

                PEARCE.What I am trying to impress upon the Minister is the fact that the taxpayer is not concerned so much with the right of appeal on questions of law, as upon the right to appeal on questions of fact upon which the Commissioner may have arrived at a decision as to what properly is taxable income. The Commissioner should be required to show that the exercise of his discretion is warranted by the facts of a particular case. Who is to determine that? As I read the law, the Commissioner has autocratic power in that respect. It is doubtful whether there is any appeal to the Board of Review on questions of fact, and there is certainly no appeal to the court on questions of fact regarding matters upon which the Commissioner may exercise his discretion and form his opinion. We should go fully into this matter to see whether there is justification for giving such wide powers to the Commissioner without appeal.
            </para>
            <para>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to clear up a point which has been exercising the minds of taxpayers. It has to do with the taxation of extra-Australian income. A New Zealand company which pays dividends to a resident of Australia is liable to pay New Zealand income tax on the profits from which the dividend is paid. Will the Federal Commissioner admit that the income of the shareholder, that is, the dividend, has borne tax in New Zealand ? Otherwise, although the profits of the New Zealand company may have borne a high rate of tax in New Zealand, the shareholder will again have to pay Federal income tax on the distributions from profits which come to him in the form of dividends. I understand that this . matter has been cleared up in the House of Representatives, but as there still remains some misunderstanding among taxpayers, I should be pleased if the Minister would state quite definitely that the point has been settled. </para>
            <para>The Senate should also give attention to the proposed amendments of the law relating to the taxation of private companies. It has been alleged, and I think with some justification, that some persons have taken advantage of our income tax assessment law to evade taxation by the formation of what is called private companies. One can sympathise with the efforts of the Government and of the Commissioner to alter the law so that, while bona fide companies may continue paying the rate of taxation fixed for such companies, persons who form bogus companies for the purpose of evading taxation may be compelled to pay at the rate applicable to individual taxpayers. </para>
            <para>If the bill goes through in its present form, a serious anomaly will be created regarding the proposed exemptions from double taxation. This matter is dealt with under section 18 of the principal act. Section 37 of the act fixes a limit of three years within which readjustment of assessment can be made, but that period is not sufficient. Take the case of an income liable to taxation in Great Britain and in Australia. Three years is altogether too short a period for the adjustment of claims relating to double taxation exemption. The returns have to be sent in in the two countries, the assessments have to be made out, and sent to the taxpayers. When we recall the length of time necessary for getting out the assessment on purely Australian income, it becomes evident that a period greater than three years is necessary to deal with incomes such as we are now considering. The taxpayer, after having obtained his assessment from Great Britain and Australia, must then set about endeavouring to obtain the readjustment which the law has provided for in order to avoid double taxation. And all this has to be done, and the claim settled, within three years. </para>

                    <para>- I did not know, but it does not matter whether it is or not. The court cannot make laws; only Parliament can do that. As three years is too short, I suggest that clause 19 of the bill should be amended to meet cases of this kind. Under clause 19 the Commissioner is to be given power to re-open assessments at any time during a period of six years, and if the Commissioner is to be able to act within that period, it is unfair to expect the taxpayer to complete matters in regard to readjustment claims within a period of three years. </para>

            <para>Another anomaly likely to be created by this legislation has also to do with the taxation of extra-Australian income. In the case I am about to quote the values are hypothetical, but the facts are clear enough. Owing to the fall in overseas freights during the last year or so, especially on cargo ships, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which owns an immense deposit of ore in a place called Iron Knob, in South Australia, has been able to export ore to countries overseas. I am sure that the Minister will admit that that is all to the good. </para>

                PEARCE.Let us assume that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company realizes £1 a ton on the ore exported. Suppose the expenses outside Australia are 5s. a ton, and those incurred inside Australia are also5s. a ton. Under the existing law, of that profit of 10s. a ton, half is liable to taxation, and half is exempt. The amending bill will make the whole 10s. taxable unless income tax is payable outside Australia on the extra-Australian proportion of the profits. If we compare this with what happens to the extraAustralian income earned by an investment of an Australian resident in a company which owns tin-mines in Siam, we shall see that an injustice will be done to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Under the present law the whole of the profits of the Siam Company are exempt, as the income is not earned in Australia, and the tin is subject to a royalty charge in Siam. Under the amended law, if income tax or royalty is payable abroad on such profits, the income is not taxable here; but if income tax or royalty is not payable abroad, then, the income will be taxable in Australia. However, if a royalty is payable to the Siamese Government on the tin mined, the profit made by the mining company will still be exempt from Australian taxation. That is provided for in this bill. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company uses Australian capital, employs Australians in Australia, and pays a royalty to the South Australian Government on the ore produced; but this will not save it from having to pay income tax on that part of its income earned by the export of iron ore, although the payment of a royalty to the Siamese Government will protect the dividends of the Siamese company from Australian taxation. Surely, if the Siamese company is to be exempt because it pays royalties, the Australian company should also be exempt.
            </para>
            <para>I return now to the provisions in the bill directed against bogus companies and partnerships formed for the purpose of evading taxation. There is one form of partnership upon which the commissioner apparently looks with anything but a friendly eye - that is, the family partnership. When a man is in receipt of a very large income, one can understand, perhaps, that he may be tempted to draw up a partnership deed with members of his family for the purpose of reducing the amount of income tax payable. It might be that such a partnership was not a bona fide one. There is, however, a class of family partnership in this country which is very common, and which is, I contend, bona fide, and should receive sympathetic consideration. Honorable senators know that one of the problems with which men on the land are faced is io find careers for their sons. As the sons reach maturity tha Tendency is for them to drift to the cities. Usually they are not paid wages by their fathers. A father takes the view That the property will descend to his sons, and that consideration often encourages the sons to remain on the farm. Somerimcs, however, that encouragement does not prove sufficient. The sons are not prepared to wait on in the hope of inheriting the property; they want something more substantial. In. many such cases the farmer, who is getting up in years, enters into a bona fide partnership with his sons. He himself takes an ever-decreasing share in the active management of the farm, though he still remains as the directing head. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the opinion expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> and also by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> that this is a measure which could be more effectively discussed during the committee stage. In these circumstances, I do not propose to take up very much time at this juncture in debating its provisions, but shall content myself by making one or two general observations. I ask the Minister whether fit is not practicable to devise some means of simplifying our income tax legislation, and to make it capable of being understood by the man in the street. The entry of the Federal authority into the arena of direct taxation has created a new class of individual in our community - the taxation expert. He is a useful person, possessing in many instances high qualifications and attainments, but before the entry of the Federal Government into this sphere of taxation it was unnecessary for taxpayers to seek the. assistance of such persons in the preparation of returns. The States income tax legislation, with which I am familiar, is so simply stated that it can readily be understood by every taxpayer. There is no insuperable difficulty in the preparation of State returns or in determining the incidence of the taxation laws upon taxpayers generally. In the Federal sphere, however, we seem to be propounding mathematical problems of such importance that even lawyers find difficulty in advising their clients, while the man in the street throws up his hands in dismay. When the amount of taxation to be paid is large, he usually finds it worth while to take counsel with a taxation expert. In these circumstances I trust that, at the earliest possible date, the Government will take this matter into consideration, and see whether taxpayers cannot be relieved at least to some extent in this regard. </para>

                <para>At first glance it seems a perfectly sound principle to tax extra-Australian incomes, but, as the Minister knows, it is not as simple at it appears. A good deal can be said in favour of the non-taxability of extra-Australian incomes. Certain anomalies and difficulties will arise against which we must adequately guard in the amending law. I support the Leader of the Opposition in his appeal to the Minister with respect to the question of appeals to the court. We do not wish taxpayers to be irritated, or to feel that they have been unjustly treated. There is no need for me to say anything further in support of the case that has been so clearly put by the Leader of the Opposition. I trust that the Minister will endeavour to meet the objections raised from a non-party viewpoint, and, if possible, when replying to the debate, to announce that the Government will accept an amendment on the lines suggested. If that is done, it will facilitate the passage of the hill and shorten the discussion which must necessarily ensue unless the reasonable amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition is agreed to. In section 23 of the principal act, which appears on page 27 of the memorandum circulated, the deductions allowable upon income tax are clearly set out. Included in these deductions, I find the following - </para>

                <para class="block">The object of that provision is to encourage private benevolence in the way of gifts to universities, hospitals, and such institutions. There is, however, the notable omission of art galleries and museums from that list. These, I suggest, should be included. These institutions are established and maintained for educational purposes and the cultivation of aesthetic tastes. As they are not conducted for profit they should be included in the list of institutions donations to which are allowable as deductions from income. Recently in a Victorian country town subscriptions were being obtained for erecting an art gallery sooner than was intended, in order to relieve the acute unemployment in the building trade. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> number of persons were willing to contribute, but objected on the ground that if they gave, say, £100, they would be taxed on the amount subscribed. I suggest that the Minister should include art galleries and museums in the exemptions already provided, or insert a new clause to cover them. I have looked through the measure to see whether the Government has redeemed the promise made by the Prime Minister with regard to the taxation of mutual life assurance companies prior to the last general election. The Prime Minister in his policy speech said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The tax on mutual life assurance societies was an imposition mainly on the dependants of bread-winners. It was iniquitous to tax the provident funds contributed to by hundreds of thousands of comparatively poor people. A Labour Government would repeal the tax on mutual life assurance associations. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Representations have been made to the Prime Minister in this matter, who has stated that the change in the financial circumstances renders it impossible for the promise to be redeemed. The Government has not only failed to honour its promise, but has increased the tax on these companies by 33 per cent. The ease against the imposition of such taxation is exceedingly strong, and while it is probably futile in the present circumstances to protest against the action proposed, I desire to place on. record the objections raised. In view of the Government's declared policy,I am sure that as soon as the present depression has lifted it will endeavour to give the relief to which these societies arc justly entitled. The burden of taxation should not fall on the thrifty members of the community, who by self-sacrifice contribute premiums to provide for their old age, or for the alleviation of the distress of widows and orphans on the death of the bread-winner. A mutual life society is not a trading company, nor does it carry on business for profit or gain; it is an institution by means of which the prudent may provide for the uncertainties of life. The fundamental principle of mutual life societies is that the strong must help the weak. They are philanthropic institutions in the truest sense of the word, and the service rendered by those institutions in the alleviation of distress relieves the Commonwealth of a heavy burden. There are no persons who derive any benefit from the operations of these societies except the policy-holders and their dependants. Any charge, therefore, in the form of a tax on any part of the revenue of mutual life societies falls directly on the individuals who contribute. It forms a deduction from the amounts which will eventually he payable to widows and orphans, the vast majority of whom would be destitute without this form of protection. All governments have recognized that institutions promoting thrift should be encouraged. Other institutions of a type similar to mutual life societies, such as savings banks, friendly societies, and provident funds, are exempt from Commonwealth taxation, and we claim that that exemption should be extended to mutual life assurance societies. Governmental recognition that mutual life societies should be exempt from taxation already exists, not only in the case of the Dominion of Canada, but throughout the Union of South Africa. </para>
                <para>A memorandum I hold sets out categorically under four heads, the objections of these companies to this taxation. Its statement of the case is definitely in accord with the policy of the Government, which I presume has been prevented from giving effect to its proposals only by the stringency of the times. As this tax affects approximately 2,500,000 policy-holders, honorable senators will realize how extensive is its incidence. The encouragement and development of the primal qualities of thrift and foresight should be stimulated and not retarded by legislation. I make this protest, and commend the matter to the early consideration of the Government. </para>

                <para>Taxation affects every person in the community, and income tax forms are the bane of existence in some quarters. Speaking of my own State in particular, I say without fear of contradiction that simplicity itself prevailed in relation to income tax legislation, every man being, so to speak, his own lawyer in dealing with income tax returns. But there has gradually crept upon us what a distinguished gentleman in another place has described as " problems of higher mathematics " that have to be faced in the calculation of income tax, even when one knows what one's income is. The object of this legislation is to determine what income is. Sometimes it is shown to be greater than what one has actually received, that result having been obtained by a calculation in the curve of the third degree. On one occasion, when I had an opportunity of addressing some distinguished gentlemen who were supposed to be versed in the intricacies of problems relating to income tax - a study of which, to my mind, is akin to a study of Sanskrit - I invited them to calculate for me the amount of tax that had to be paid on  a hypothetical income. They had not in their breast pockets the ready-reckoner and calculator that they consult on such occasions, and without such an aid were unable to tell me the amount of tax that had to be paid. I allude to that only for the purpose of stressing the point that has been so well made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson.</inline> It is a pity that, with his exceptional ability, the Commissioner does not apply Mb mind to the evolving of a simpler system than that which is now in vogue in this country. The present system has bred a new form of taxation, a fresh levy on the business community, in the shape of the taxation expert. Surely a country with a population of 6,000,000 persons does not need taxation experts! Our complexities are not so great as are those of other parts of the world. I venture to think that, as the years go by, these entangling legalisms will entrench themselves, and that the red tape methods of the Taxation Department will lead to further complexities in administration. </para>
                <para>Having said so much in a general way regarding the provisions of this bill, I should like to direct the attention of honorable senators to a .departure that has been made from a principle that has operated throughout the history of income taxation- in Australia. I believe that I am right in saying that, with the exception of Tasmania, in no State in the Commonwealth, and  not in the Commonwealth  itself, has it been proposed hitherto to tax income that is earned outside Australia. The principle adopted in Great Britain is exactly the opposite. Being the great creditor nation that she is, Great Britain derives the larger part of her income from abroad. We are endeavouring to make our presence felt in the world, and are gradually obtaining in other countries the interest that arises from investment. Are not those people who act in that way the very best benefactors that this country could have at the present time? They are bringing to Australia money that is earned abroad. Yet we have this proposal, limited though it be, to levy tribute on those who, in the interests of Australia, are earning income in other parts of the world. I venture to assert that, economically, such an attitude is unsound, and it is particularly unsound at a juncture such as the present. I' hope that when the bill is in committee the Leader of the Senate will explain exactly the extent of the relief that is to be given under the clause that provides that where taxation is already levied upon that income it will not be levied a second time in Australia. 3 foresee great difficulty in administering such a provision. I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister should withdraw it, because it does offer a certain measure of relief. In some cases a taxpayer's income is made up partly of dividends from companies, upon which in certain directions tribute is levied before, distribution. Is that income to be exempt from taxation in the hands of individual shareholders? That is only one of many questions that suggest themselves to me. I am sure that every honorable senator shares the desire of the Minister and of the department to prevent the perpetration of fraud, and of what in legal as well as common parlance is described as the evasion of taxation. I believe that honorable senators generally would not for a moment subscribe to anything in the nature of evasion by taxpayers. ' The department is attempting by this measure to stop a number of leaks, but it has left untouched the big leak that occurs in connexion with bearer bonds. It would be simplicity itself to tax at its source the interest that is paid on bearer bonds. It is common knowledge that the most comprehensive method employed in Australia to-day to avoid levies that should be enforced by the Taxation Department is the use - I cannot call it misuse, because it is facilitated by the department - of bearer bonds. The attempt is being made to stop up all sorts of little leaks. Contributions to a graziers' association, forsooth, are not to be allowed as a deduction in the future, because the department was defeated in the Gordon case, in which the judgment of the court laid it down that those contributions were an allowable deduction under the law. The Commissioner, with that subtlety of mind and that capacity which he possesses, looking at the taxation legislation through the spectacles of a tax collector, came to the conclusion that those contributions never were a proper deduction. He fought the matter  in the courts, where he was defeated. So he comes to this higher court of appeal, the Parliament of Australia, to have his view established. This is only a small matter, but it illustrates my point that attention is being paid to what is comparatively insignificant, while big leakages are not being checked. I realize that in the time that it has had at its disposal the Government cannot be expected to revolutionize the income tax law ; but I commend to it the serious consideration of the question that I have raised. </para>
                <para>Turning to the averaging provisions, to which the Minister has referred, I subscribe to the view of the department that we should not allow what has been provided as a basis of relief to become a means of defeating the will of this Parliament as expressed in our income tax legislation. In that direction I think that we can unitedly support the proposals of the Government. </para>
                <para>The bill is essentially one for review in committee, but, as certain principles are involved, I propose to say a word or two about them at this stage. Provisions relating to co-operative companies are contained in the bill. I suggest that those provisions are not wide enough to meet the requirements of all the cooperative companies throughout Australia. It has been represented to me by various co-operative packing societies in the river Murray and other fruit-growing districts that they do not meet the cases of co-operative societies which have been incorporated for the purpose of packing the fruit grown by their members. In committee it may be possible to extend the scope of these provisions to include such societies. </para>
                <para>Another point that has given rise to a good deal of discussion is that in future appeals will be limited to hearing by judges of the High Court. It is not a simple matter for the judges of the High Court to visit the more distant States. </para>

                    referred to the case of private companies. I suggest that the Government has gone a little too far in proposed new section 21a which makes retrospective its provisions relating to such companies. The proposed new section will operate from the date of the coming into operation of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915! As I understand the law, and, indeed, as it has been laid down by the Privy Council and the House of Lords in connexion with certain income tax cases, there is nothing inherently wrong, either morally or legally, in a man avoiding taxation so long as he acts within the law. The wrong consists in evading taxation. In a case which occurred in England -

                    - Lord Sumner, a famous jurist, said -

                    <para>The highest authorities have always recognized that the subject is entitled so to arrange his affairs as not to attract taxes imposed by the Crown, so far as he can do so within the law, and that he may legitimately claim the advantage of any express terms, or of any omissions, that he can find in his favour. In doing so he neither comes under liability nor incurs blame. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In those words Lord Sumner has expressed the view which I have always held. It may be that all that the departmental officers claim to have taken place, has, in fact, taken place; in such a matter I accept their word. But if we have stood by and allowed this thing to go on from 1915 until now, we should not be acting in accordance with the best British traditions if we were now to date back to 1915 legislation affecting private companies. We are justified in taking action to prevent a recurrence of such happenings in the future, but if we make this legislation retrospective we shall place the taxpayer who has done the things complained of, not in the position in which he would have been had he acted otherwise, but in a much worse position. That, however, is a matter which can be more conveniently debated in committee. At this stage I merely suggest that the Government reconsider the retrospectivity of proposed new section 21a. </para>
                <para>While I at all times respect the opinions of men holding high and difficult offices under the Crown, I cannot  bring myself to vote for a provision which makes  a  departmental head the final arbiter of the rights of a citizen in his dealings with the Crown. I know how difficult it is at times to prevent wrongdoers from escaping; but that difficulty does not justify our making the Commissioner of Taxation his own court of appeal. Throughout the bill we have such phrases as " in the discretion of the Commissioner " and "in his opinion ". I suggest that the Commissioner will always view taxation matters from a departmental standpoint. By reason of his training, he cannot properly appreciate the taxpayer's point of view; he cannot deal judicially with the various matters brought before him for determination. The Commissioner of Taxation is not different from other men in that respect. I personally am at times inclined to judge happenings from the point of view of my personal interest, rather than from a strictly judicial standpoint. Despite their confidence  in  the administration, the taxpayers of this country would be relieved to  know  that from any decision of the Commissioner there is to be a right of appeal. There are not many appeals. I believe that the Commissioner always acts conscientiously and takes cases to court only when he feels that it is right for him to do so. " All looks yellow to the jaundiced eye ", and I suggest that no Commissioner of Taxation can do other than view taxation matters through departmental spectacles. While I am prepared to grant the Commissioner wide powers to deal with wrongdoers, persons who  in  evading the law commit crimes. I feel that a right of appeal should remain. If the Commissioner were a person removed from the administration of his own department,  it  would be another matter; but he is so actively engaged in affairs of the Taxation Department that he must necessarily be affected by the departmental atmosphere. From him instructions of administration issue; to him are referred all matters of importance requiring decision. It is he who issues departmental rulings from time to time. He is so surrounded by the atmosphere of the department that it is impossible for him to be absolutely free from departmental bias. In saying that, I make no reflection on the Commissioner personally; no human situated as he is could be entirely free from departmental bias. When their activities do not affect me personally, I have a great admiration for the officers of the Taxation Department; but it is contrary to human nature and to experience for them to view taxation from the point of view of the taxpayer. </para>

I have a great admiration for the Commissioner personally; although I should probably not be allowed to express my impersonal view in this chamber. In committee I shall endeavour to amend the bill along the lines that I have indicated, particularly its provisions in relation to private companies and appeals against decisions of the Commissioner. In the meantime, I ask the Minister to consider the points raised with a view to meeting them, if possible. I am in sympathy with much that is proposed in this measure; in committee I hope that we shall be able so to modify the bill as to make it acceptable to all parties. </para>

                    <para>. -  I remind honorable senators, that about 200,000 of our people are not very much concerned at the present time with the discretion of income tax commissioners. Those persons who to-day have incomes on which taxation is payable are, indeed, fortunate, when one considers the very large number who by force of circumstances have practically no income at all. So what may appear to be a great hardship in normal times becomes a reasonable proposition in a period of crisis such as that through which we are now passing. I shall accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and discuss fully with members of the Senate the Government's reasons for the retrospectivity of some of. the provisions of the bill. I disagree, however, with the proposition that because the Parliament has allowed certain persons, within the law, admittedly, not to pay what the Senate may consider would have been a most equitable tax, we should  not now insist upon the performance by them of the obligation to meet that tax. I think that honorable senators will admit that there is a strong feeling on both sides in politics that, in order to meet our present difficulties, a wealth tax should be levied. This view is not limited to any particular section, and it is animated by the thought that, after all, large numbers of persons in this country have become wealthy during the period of false prosperity through which Australia has recently passed. If the Senate is satisfied that a small section of the taxpayers has been let off at the expense of a very large section, those persons should not be allowed to continue to escape fair taxation. </para>

                <para>Turning to the court of appeal, I remind honorable senators that when the High Court was constituted, it was contemplated that it should be essentially a court of law ; it was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that the judges of the High Court should act as a court of review, with a discretion that is obviously ministerial. The fact that we have a board of review at the present time was glossed over by the Leader of the Opposition, and lost sight of by other honorable senators. This board consists of three men whose reputation, and whose ability to perform the task entrusted to them, are beyond question. It consists of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> S. Hume, a taxation expert of many years standing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Canning,</inline> a barrister at law and one time a special magistrate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lightband,</inline> a public accountant. In each State there is a taxpayers' association, and in each capital city a chamber of commerce. I invite honorable senators, who suggest that we should impose on the High Court the duty of inquiring into matters which are now being inquired into by the Board of Review, to mention one objection to the present practice, that has ever been raised by a taxpayers' association, or by a chamber of commerce in any part of Australia. No objection has reached the ears of the department to this procedure, .which was introduced by the predecessors of the present Government, and has worked apparently satisfactorily since the system was instituted. Is not the more appropriate tribunal to deal with appeals the body that we now have consisting of a taxation expert, a public accountant and a barrister at law ? I submit that the taxpayer is sufficiently protected, and until a stronger case than has been made out is established, the Senate should hesitate before suggesting that the powers exercised by it be vested in the High Court. </para>

                    referred to a notable omission from the list of deductions from taxable income. He spoke of gifts to public art galleries and museums. There is a lot to be said against the exemption of such gifts. The honorable senator remarked that a man who was asked to make a donation to such a public institution would say, "If I do that, I shall have to pay income tax on it." If this is regarded merely as a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and doing it in the name of charity, I am against such a principle. But the danger of such a provision is that a grant may be made to one of these bodies, and the money may be used for a work of pure convenience as opposed to a work of necessity. Never in the history of Australia has it been so necessary as it is to-day for us to husband our resources at home and abroad. The giving of £10,000 to a particular institution, so that it may erect a building for the convenience of the students of that institution does not increase the absorptive capacity of the nation by 1 per cent; but if the £10,000 is allowed to remain as part of the -national resources for the development of our lands, it may increase our absorptive capacity eventually to such an extent that hundreds more people may find profitable occupation. Therefore, I ask the Senate to hesitate before permitting an addition to the deductions that may be made from taxable income even for charitable objects. We cannot afford at the present time to extend the exemptions. Every exemption means an addition to the burdens of the rest of the taxpayers. We are faced with a difficult financial position, and we have budgeted for certain revenue and expenditure. A definite sum of money is required to enable us to carry on the governmental operations of this country, and we have told the people how much we expect to raise by direct taxation. If one class of taxpayer is relieved from taxation an extra burden is automatically imposed on the remainder of the community. Therefore, it is our duty to make the distribution of the burden as equitable as possible among the whole of the people.

                        <para>- Honorable senators should realize that persons who live in Australia and derive ex-Australian income enjoy the benefit of free education and other advantages provided by the States. In times like these, when State Governments have to consider whether they will discontinue or reduce those benefits or apply to the Commonwealth for a disability grant, we should not complicate the position by exempting any citizens of the Commonwealth who come within this category. The matter was given the fullest consideration by the taxation authorities, and an attempt has been made by the Government to spread the burden equitably over all classes of the community. The Government is prepared to listen, in committee, to suggestions as to inequities that may arise under this scheme, but, unless it can be shown how the leeway can be made up, the Senate can follow only one course. </para>

                    <para>. - I fear that we will become involved in some difficulties under the operation of the clause referred to by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition. I take no exception to the definition, but I do to the position referred to by the right honorable senator. I think that it is almost declaratory of the law as it stands at present, as applied to a series of transactions involving profit. If a man is trading for profit there is no doubt that his is taxable income. If a property is purchased for the purpose of making income, any resultant profit is. properly, taxable income, but, if a person who buys a property to live in ultimately changes his mind and sells at a profit, the income so derived is not taxable income, but is accretion of capital. We have a series of decisions on that point by the State courts as well as the High Court. I think that the department has stated the position pretty clearly in the explanatory brochure that has been circulated. This is an endeavour to collect taxation on an isolated transaction, and it does not seem fair that we should make the provision retrospective to 1922: </para>

                <para class="block">That is the point. It has been the practice of the department for many years to tax this particular class of transaction, there is judicial authority for it, and Parliament has allowed it to continue. Suddenly, however, in a court in another country doubt has been raised as to whether it is, within the meaning of the </para>
                <para>English p'ractice, profit or income. I do not think that we need be concerned with what the opinion of judges may be  as.  to what is income. Our present concern is whether this particular class of transaction was intended by this Parliament to be taxed. Hitherto it has been taxed, and the bill provides no departure from the existing practice in that respect. Indeed if it had not been for the possibility of the High Court feeling that., whatever its own opinion might be,  it  would be bound by the decision in the Leeming case, there would have been no necessity for this amendment. I do not think that honorable senators will ask that this class of taxpayer which has been taxed in the past with the approval of the highest judicial authority in the land, should be exempt. If they do, they must be prepared to allow the taxation that these people are released from paying to be placed on the shoulders  of  others. Is there anything unfair in asking a man who has made a profit in an isolated transaction to pay tax upon it? Is there any logical justification foi releasing him from income taxation? </para>

Until it reaches that point the paragraph is only declaring the well-settled law of Australia. These last few words, however, seem to extend the law further than it has hitherto been applied. A man buys a block of land on which to build a house. He buys it at the market value, and holds it for a time. After a period he finds that it is not convenient for him to build a home on it, and he sells it. While he has held the block it has increased in value. Clearly the difference between the purchase price and the sale price is accretion of capital. I ask whether the words " profit-making undertaking or scheme " will cover . a transaction such as this, which has hitherto been held to be outside the pale of the present taxation law? </para>

                        <para>- The land speculator is already taxed ; so also is the man who is not a speculator, but buys land for the purpose of making a profit. It has been shown in a variety of ways that a man who has bought land, and made a profit on it, simply because he has held it for some time, is not liable to income taxation on the transaction. Under the principles of British law and decisions of the High Court it is regarded as an accretion of capital, and not as income. If the words " profit-making undertaking or scheme" are qualified by the earlier words of the paragraph, no objection can be taken to them, but, in the everyday parlance of the people, the man who sells land for more than he has paid for it has made a profit. </para>

                        <para>- The distinction has been drawn in a multitude of decisions. There has never been any attempt under British law or our own principles of taxation to tax an accretion of capital brought about in the way I have indicated. If assessments are not to be re-opened, provision can be made in section 25 to protect the taxpayer against any injustice, and I see no other point to which I can take particular exception. </para>

I am unable to find in the bill any provision for an appeal to the Board of Review on the facts. The question of domicile is important, and it may be of great moment to a taxpayer. Surely the decision of the Commissioner on the facts connected with the domicile of a taxpayer should be subject to appeal to the Board of Review, because, upon his decision, rests the liability of the taxpayer to pay taxation as a citizen of the Commonwealth or as an absentee. I should like the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to say definitely whether an appeal will lie to the Board of Review, and, if so, whether it will be on the questions of fact. Will the Minister also explain why there is no provision for appeal to the court ? </para>
                <para>SenatorDALY (South Australia - Vice-President of the Executive Council) [2.47].  -  The question of domicile can only arise when an assessment has been made. Income tax returns are classified and the assessment of the Commissioner is dependent upon a number of facts, amongst which is that relating to domicile. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the domicile of the person furnishing a return is outside Australia, the assessment can be appealed against to the Board of Review. The question of domicile would be one of the questions upon which the board would have to be satisfied before arriving at a decision. Section 44 provides, in sub-section 1 - </para>

The constitution of the Australian Aero Club provides that it shall not be carried on for the purpose of profit. All the branches of this club i the various States are doing magnificent work in training air pilots. Since these clubs are not carried on for a profit, they should be exempt from taxation on the amount of the grant which they receive from the Government for the encouragement of civil aviation. This vast island continent is particularly adapted for aviation, and already Australian pilots have proved themselves to lie amongst the foremost in the world. Recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay</inline> equipped an aerial expedition at his own expense and, flying to Central Australia, mapped a vast area of unexplored country. He also discovered an immense lake, the existence of which was unknown. In Canada, civil aviation plays an important part in fighting forest fires, and in mapping unexplored territory. Recently civil aviators there mapped an area of 200,000 square miles of new forest country. In Australia valuable services are being rendered daily to the community by commercial aviation companies and civil aviators. Persons suffering from sickness in the interior are conveyed to hospitals, and when occasion arises doctors and nurses are transported from place to place to minister to persons who are in need of skilled attention. These aero clubs are doing a wonderful work in the development of Australia. Already they have trained over 300 " A " class pilots who are ready to take their part in the defence of this country in the event of war. These pilots, I venture to say, would constitute our first line of defence. It is impossible to speak too highly of the extraordinary efficiency of pilots trained by aero clubs in Australia. We are all proud of the achievements of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ross</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Smith, Parer. Mackintosh, Hinkler, Kingsford Smith, and many others.  We  also pay a high tribute to the courage and resourcefulness of Miss Amy Johnson, the English aviatrix, who flew solo to Australia a few months ago. She was trained by the London Aero Club. In view of the splendid work which these aero clubs of Australia are doing in training pilots, it is only fair that their incomes should be exempt from taxation. The men who have been trained in Australia and who are performing wonderful  work in the interests of our country, are always available should their services be required by the Defence Department. During the Great War Americans were sent to England to be trained as pilots in aero clubs in order to enable them to engage in aviation work at the front. These aero clubs are conducted on a totally different basis from those wonderful companies such as the Australian Airways Limited, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service, and the Larkin Aircraft Supply Company, which have secured world's records in the carrying of passengers and mail matter. I am not suggesting that these companies should be exempt from taxation, because they are trading for profit; but I wish to place on record their wonderful achievements. I understand that up to March of this year the aircraft of the three companies that I have mentioned have flown 2,519,578 miles in 32,448 flying hours without serious mishap, and have carried 373,777 lb. in freight, and 1,676,933 letters without the loss of a single letter. I think it can safely be said that our pilots are the most efficient in the world. I remind honorable senators that the Atlantic was first crossed by air in 1919 by Arthur Whitten Brown and John Alcock, both Britishers, ten years before Lindbergh performed the same feat. Kingsford Smith is an Australiantrained pilot who, in addition to being the first to fly the Pacific, has also flown over the Atlantic Ocean and the Tasman Sea, and was the first pilot to circle the world by air. I believe that the Government, in the assistance which it has given to the five principal clubs, recognizes the good work being done by aero clubs. Under existing conditions assistance is given by the Commonwealth Government through the Department of Defence on the following basis: - </para>

Training of this kind equips them for assisting in the defence of our country. No less than 300 pilots have been trained, at a cost of only £20 each to the Government, whereas, to provide a similar training in the Air Force, would probably cost hundreds of pounds.

                <para class="block">The clubs are all vigorous bodies. They are controlled by committees of aviation enthusiasts, whose chief aim is to foster aviation in the Commonwealth. Under their articles all clubs are prohibited from distributing any profit among members. In other words they are associations which are not operating for profit. Their work is carried out efficiently and enthusiastically. The rates charged for flying rank favorably with those charged in any part of the world, notwithstanding the high cost of spares, petrol, oil, &amp;c., The pioneer clubs of the movement in Australia have their head-quarters in Sydney and Melbourne. These clubs started flying operations in August, 1926, and, up to the 31st May of this year, had registered up to 20,500 hours of flying, and had trained 300 pupils for an " A " licence. In addition to the training of pupils, the clubs carry out extremely valuable work by giving ex-war pilots the opportunity to retain their efficiency at a very low cost, thus preserving a valuable asset to Australia in time of need. But for the existence of the air clubs many of the ex-war pilots, through a lack of training, would become, to use a colloquialism "rusty" ; but, on payment of a reasonable fee, they can hire a machine and thus retain their efficiency. Aero clubs arc not confined to Australia, but are operating in England, Canada, India, Singapore, South Africa and New Zealand. In all parts of the Empire their worth is recognized and they are afforded a substantial measure of support. For the year ended 30th September, the Government subsidy and bonus to the Victorian section of the Australian Aero Club was £300, the total earnings including Government assistance, £2,317 19s. Id., and the profit £436 3s. 3d. In 1928 the figures were £308 5s., £3,183 5s. 4d. and £491 ls. 3d. respectively. In 1929 the Government assistance and bonus was £1,753 3s. 8d., the total earnings, including Government assistance, £6,556 13s. 10d., and the loss, £85 3s. lid. It -will be noted that although the turnover has increased by nearly 300 per cent, no profit has been made. This is due to the club's policy to keep the cost of flying down so that it may be within the reach of everyone. The club is doing exceedingly valuable work, as will be shown by a comparison between the cost of training a pilot under the Aero Club's scheme with that of the Royal Australian Air Force. In the former case, the Government pays a small proportion and the pupil pays the rest. When trained, an aero club pilot is not as expert or efficient as are Royal Australian Air Force pilots; but, in time of need, the training he has received would be of great value, and he would only require a little additional training to become fully competent. The position at present is somewhat ludicrous. The clubs are not taxed on the income received from members, but on the revenue from other sources which is derived in  the form of Government subsidies and bonuses which are subject to taxation. </para>

I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said concerning the exceptional value of aero clubs in the national life of Australia. But surely the honorable senator does not suggest that the present provisions of the act impose any hardship upon aero clubs because, as he has stated, the clubs' rules preclude them from making any profit. I can assure the honorable senator that it is the policy of the department to tax only the profits. </para>

If honorable senators will refer to section 14 of the act they will find that the exemptions provided are already very comprehensive, and, in fact, too much so, considering the heavy taxation which has to be paid by other sections of the community. If aero clubs were exempted claims would immediately be made by the representatives of other athletic clubs. </para>

                        <para>- In this uneconomic age we do many uneconomic things; but, I remind the honorable senator that there is a danger in establishing a precedent. If we exempt aero clubs because they are in receipt of a subsidy from the Government, we could on the same basis decline to impose taxation upon the profits of, say, the manufacturer of galvanized iron, who receives a bonus. We subsidize the East-West air service, which is  working in competition with the transcontinental railway. </para>

                        <para>- The principle is the same. We tax companies to whom we give a bonus, and, in the same way, tax aero clubs which we subsidize. In that respect, an aero club is in  a  similar position to a company which receives  a  bounty. I suggest that no real hardship is imposed upon these clubs, and that if they were exempt an agitation would immediately be- raised for the exemption of other clubs. This is not a time to exempt the payment of  a  legitimate tax. </para>

                        <para>- That is easy to understand. They feel that there is a possibility of some one other than Miss Amy Johnson flying to Australia, and giving them an opportunity to make profits. So long as these clubs confine their activities to the training of pilots - for which they are granted a subsidy by the Government - there is no likelihood of their making profits. But should circumstances arise to make profits possible, why should they be exempt from taxation? </para>

                    <para>. - Aero clubs are different from other clubs. Some time ago I suggested that various automobile clubs might be exempted, but, on reflection, I feel that their case is entirely different from that of aero clubs. During the war the greatest difficulty was found in providing an adequate number of trained pilots to keep pace with front line wastage. The most difficult time in training was when the pilot had to fly alone. Indeed, a considerable number of the casualties in the Air Force occurred when pilots were undertaking their first solo flights. I submit 'that the training of pilots by these aero clubs would save a great deal of time in training them in the event of war. They would already have gained confidence and air-sense. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that any profits made by aero clubs would not be used for personal " gain, but would be expended in improving aerodromes, landing grounds, &amp;c. The Minister said that in the event of the clubs making huge profits, those profits should be taxed. I should like to see them make profits, because the consequent improvements to aerodromes and landing grounds would be in the interests of aviation generally. It should be a sufficient safeguard to provide that any profits made shall be expended in furthering aviation. I hope that the Minister will accept the . proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline></para>

The British aeroplane, in which I travelled, carried eighteen passengers, and appeared to me to be a fine machine: But on arrival at Berlin I was compelled to admit that aviation had made greater strides in Germany than in England. Ninety regular services extend from Berlin to Sweden, Russia, Austria, Turkey, Spain, and even to Africa. Every few minutes one of the aeroplanes engaged in those services either arrived at or departed from the Berlin aerodrome. Britain was financially crippled through financing the war, with the result that in aviation matters she has fallen behind other countries. But while Britain made little progress- because of financial difficulties, German aero services were built up with American capital. Remembering what I saw while abroad, particularly in Germany, I am prepared to do all that I can to foster aviation in Australia, particularly as this country is so suited to flying." I think that this small concession should be granted to aero clubs. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point. We are considering the advisability of exempting aero clubs from taxation. These clubs are already granted a subsidy by the Commonwealth. From the point of view of Commonwealth revenue, it might be well if they were allowed to make profits for then a subsidy would nnt he necessary. If this exemption is granted, before long some South Australian senator will urge that the motor cycle club of that State should be similarly treated. Men who engage in flying, or, indeed, in motor cycling, do so for the love of it. The question of profit does not enter into their thoughts. I do not know whether in modern warfare homing pigeons are used to any extent ; but if they were, I can see the possibility of applications being made for the exemption of such clubs from taxation. In South Australia there are many pigeon clubs, which conduct regular pigeon races. They are doing as valuable work from a defence point of view, as are the aero clubs. If we exempt aero clubs, claims from these other clubs for exemptions could not consistently be rejected. The basis of exemption should not be that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> namely, the time taken to train pilots. That may form the basis for some consideration by the Defence Department for an increased subsidy to the club; but we have to consider whether at this time all clubs should be exempt from the payment of income tax. If meaningless amendments such as this are carried, we shall be inundated with requests for exemption from clubs of all description. If we exempt aero clubs, it will be very difficult to differentiate between the applications made on behalf of different organizations. This is a time when it is necessary to close down on exemptions. There is no question of any hardship being imposed upon aero clubs by the operation of the bill, or that the Government's taxation proposals will hamper the activities of aero clubs and prevent the expeditious training of pilots. In the circumstances, I ask the Senate to reject the amendment. </para>

                    (South Australia) | 3. 32].  -  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision. Aero clubs are on a different plane from other clubs. They are performing a national work. The men that they train take their lives in their hands every time they go aloft. The finest types of our young manhood are attracted to aviation, and as these aviation clubs will become our first line of defence under the policy of the Government, nothing should be done to discourage their development. I subscribe to all that the Minister has said with regard to the undesirability of opening a gap in the measure through which all types of organizations may gain exemption from taxation. But our aero clubs are serving a very lofty purpose. There can be no comparison between them and motor cycle clubs. This new science is of tremendous importance to the country, and even if the Minister were logical I should allow my sympathy to go in favour of the amendment. But I do not think that the honorable senator is logical. I should not support at this juncture any suggestion to exempt motor cycle clubs, racing clubs, sporting clubs, and so forth. Everybody in the community should bear his quota of taxation so far as is practicable.

                <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [3,36]. - I am sorry that so much misplaced sentiment is being intruded into the discussion. I am prepared to endorse all that has been said as to the merits of aviators and as to the use of aero clubs. By reason of their daring, aero clubs might almost be christened "hero clubs." However, if it is necessary to grant further assistance to such bodies, that can be done by additional subsidies. The chief object of this bill is to close all loopholes through which income taxation may be evaded. It is a wonderful testimony to the dishonesty of the commercial community that so many ingenious methods have been practised to evade the payment of taxation, and that it is necessary to tighten up the law as we are now doing. If we exempted aero clubs from taxation, we might well carry the principle further. Who could be more worthy of exemption than those brave people who risk their lives on the deep; the heroes who remain by their wireless sets, sending out S.O.S. signals, remaining on the ship until the last moment, and frequently going down with it? One could point to many ways in which heroism, which happily is inherent in human nature, manifests itself, but surely such things are irrelevant to the present debate. I put it as a matter of common sense that if aero clubs require special consideration, it should be given to them in the form of subsidies. </para>

We have our machines on order, and have had the money to pay for them for over three years. The subscriptions range from £6 6s., for flying members, downwards for ordinary and country members. If they are not liable to taxation, I am quite satisfied with this provision in the bill. Undoubtedly, aero clubs are performing a signal service  to  the country by inculcating in our people an air-sense, which 90 per cent.  of  the people of Australia lack, because of the dearth of facilities hitherto available. It is imperative that we should develop an air-sense, as, if we have to defend our country, we shall have to rely on our aviators to supply our " eyes." I am not very keen on "gestures," because they do not mean very much. The reference sounds very nice; but I like a little more meat on the bone. The other members of my club will be satisfied if subscriptions are not liable to be taxed. </para>

                        <para>- Well, ' with members of bicycle and similar clubs. The honorable senator might just as well have compared them with members of spinning top clubs. Our embryo aviators take tremendous risks when learning to fly, and they have to supply most of the money to enable them to gain proficiency in the art. Unfortunately, quite a number make the supreme sacrifice. </para>

                        <para>- T h at kind of sport has more value to the nation than any other type. Australia has a coastline of about 12,000 miles, and we must rely on our aviators to act as our spotters if this country is ever attacked. I admit that the Commonwealth Government gives a subsidy to aero clubs for every " A "-class pilot who graduates, but the club and the trainee are involved in an expenditure much more than the amount of the subsidy. They are not receiving much encouragement. An additional duty of over £100 has been imposed on Moth machines, the type most needed by aero clubs for training purposes. They are not ordinary clubs in any sense of the word. They are teaching the best of our young people that air-sense which is so essential to Australia. I do not know any other country in which civil aviatiot. has received such poor assistance. </para>

                        <para>- They think it is. At any rate it is an encouragement to them. The Essendon aerodrome in Victoria is  a  disgrace. It  is a  bog when there is any rain. There is a reservoir in the middle of the area into which two capable aviators crashed during a storm. I have visited the aerodrome when it has been in a deplorable condition. When I asked why the club did not put cinders down to improve the runway, I was told that the club had not sufficient money to do it. There is not a decent aerodrome in  Australia. </para>

I do not know where these aero clubs get their money, but within twenty miles of Sydney they are spending something like £60,000 or £80,000 in building an aerodrome on the Liverpool road.

                    <para>. - I notice that trade unions are exempt from taxation. I should think that aero clubs are equally entitled to be exempted. My statement about the aerodromes of Australia being inefficient was based on the comments of flying men who have visited Australia, including <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alan</inline> Cobham, and those of the  president  of the Australian Aero Club, and the  president  of the club in Victoria. Surely those gentlemen know more about aerodromes than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> does. I do not pretend to be an authority on the subject, but the aerodromes I have seen are very bad, and few and far between. I am assured by the presidents of these clubs, who are noted airmen, that we have not one really good, efficient, well-drained aerodrome in Australia. </para>

I have particularly in mind the export of iron ore from South Australia on which royalty is paid. It may be urged that my amendment would embrace the export of timber, because royalty is paid on timber in a number of . the States, but at present the export of timber from Australia is negligible. We cannot produce enough timber to supply our own requirements. It is true that a little jarrah is exported. </para>

                    <para>- I presume the honorable senator is of opinion that it is well that Australia should try to do so. One of the things wrong with the country to-day is that its export trade is not big enough to balance importations. The margin of profit on the iron ore which is exported from Australia is so small that the taxation now proposed will be just about sufficient to tip the scale against any continuance of this export, particularly when we bear in mind that owing to the diminution in importations generally an increase of shipping freights is bound to come about. </para>

                PEARCE.From Iron Knob, and the South Australian Government charges royalty on it.

But I hope that the Government will not consider the proposal from the point of view of the immediate revenue to be obtained It is important that we should do everything possible to encourage the export trade. The companies which I have in mind are to-day labouring under serious disadvantages. Owing to the present industrial depression, they have been obliged to close down some of their furnaces. Since the question which I have raised involves government policy, I suggest that rather than reject my proposal, the Leader of the Senate should agree to postpone consideration of the clause in  order to confer with the Prime Minister.

                <para class="block">Apparently, the Government's intention is to exempt from taxation any lease, being a perpetual lease without revaluation, or a lease with a right of purchase. We may assume, therefore, that the Government wishes to give some relief to persons who hold perpetual leases from the Crown. As far as I know the number of perpetual leases without revaluation is infinitesimal. If it is the intention of the Government to exempt pastoral leases, the proviso in the bill does not- achieve that purpose, because in Western Australia, and, I understand, most of the other States also, there are practically no perpetual leases without re-valuation. In most instances the State has a right to re-value at certain stated periods. In Western Australia there are no right of purchase leases. There are, however, conditional purchase leases, under which the lessee pays instalments for a period of about 20 years, at the end of which period he obtains the freehold. It would be interesting to learn from the Minister where are the leases that are covered by the Government's proposal. Leases from the Crown of land used for agricultural, pastoral, or grazing purposes, should not be taxed if they have been held for a period of three years or more. In most of the States there are large areas of unoccupied waste Crown lands. People should be encouraged to take up these areas and improve them. Exemption from taxation might be one  form  of encouragement. Our aim should be to increase our export trade in primary products. To do this we should encourage the occupation of all land suitable for agricultural, pastoral or grazing purposes. I agree that safeguards should be included in our taxation legislation against speculators, so my amendment provides that the lease must be held by  the  owner for three years. This condition will be a guarantee of the bona fides of the lessee, who, in the first year of his lease, will bc obliged to incur certain expenditure for stocking the land. A large  area in  Western Australia, extending practically from a little north of Geraldton to near Wyndham  and the gold-fields  as well, is held under pastoral leases, which  expire in  1948. These leases contain  a Condition  which  gives the  Crown  the right to  re-value at stated periods. </para>

                <para>Unfortunately, the prospects of the pastoral industry in Western Australia are not favorable. A few days ago it was reported in one of the Sydney newspapers that 60,000  sheep  in one district would have to be destroyed owing to the shortage of feed and the high cost of transport to agistment areas. The position  of the industry is such that the holders of Crown  leases  will not be able to bear any fresh taxation burdens. I  hope  that the Minister will accept  my  amendment, which will give  some  relief to those engaged in the agricultural and pastoral industries. </para>
                <para>SenatorDALY  (South Australia - Vice-President of the Executive Council) [4.15]. - I invite the committee to study this amendment in relation to the clause in which the proviso appears, and to determine whether, if adopted, it would not produce an absolute absurdity. The proviso  is  inserted to exempt leases which so closely resemble freehold property, that it is difficult to make a distinction. This is an income tax assessment bill under which a clear line of demarcation between capital and income has to be drawn. This particular class of pastoral lease is granted in every State, with the exception of Western Australia. It is the only class of lease resembling freehold; but the honorable senator suggests that another form of lease should also be included. If this amendment were accepted, the position would be chaotic, seeing that throughout the bill a clear distinction is made between freehold and leasehold land. It is provided that certain moneys represent an accretion of capital, and that other moneys represent income. Under the proviso, a legitimate exemption is made. In effect, the amendment provides that this particular class of leasehold shall, for the purposes of this measure be deemed to be freehold land. The proviso has been inserted as a result of a number of cases heard before the High Court, and because of the existence of a class of lease which so closely resembles freehold land, that under the law such cases can be treated as freehold. It is unreasonable to ask the National Parliament to declare that every form of leasehold shall be deemed to be freehold. </para>

Throughout the bill we are attempting to draw a distinction between capital and income, and for the purposes of this measure to bring within the definition of freehold a form of leasehold, which in reality so closely resembles freehold that it is difficult to make a distinction. A number of other leases are granted, such as the lease of an hotel, but which by no stretch of imagination can be regarded as freehold </para>

Am I right in assuming that this paragraph is not to be retrospective, and that a taxpayer having paid his tax under the existing act will not be re-assessed because of this system of differentiation between the value of sheep and the value of wool.

Numbers of companies have been formed with the object of limiting the personal liability of their members. Among them are pastoral and trading companies in all the States. The intention of the amendment is to limit the operation of the section to companies formed for the purpose of evading taxation. The sub-section is harsh also in that it is to be retrospective to 1915. An unsuccessful effort was made in another place to delete the words " <inline font-style="italic">inter alia".</inline> I hope that the amendment will be agreed to, otherwise the Commissioner could harass bona fide companies, which would have no right of appeal.

                    <para>. -  If the amendment is agreed to, the clause will be ruinous. The Com missioner would then have to prove- that the company had been formed solely for the purpose of evading taxation. I think that the honorable senator has misinterpreted the section. In its present form it provides that the Commissioner may deal with companies which have been formed for various purposes, included among them being the evasion of taxation, but if the words "inter <inline font-style="italic">alia"</inline> are omitted he would be restricted to companies formed for the express purpose of evading taxation. Instead of imposing a hardship on taxpayers, the clause in its present form provides them with some measure of relief, for it allows the Commissioner some discretion in cases of hardship. The clause is consistent with the principles ordinarily followed in legislation of this kind. I urge the committee to reject the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">Then follow the various classes of shareholders affected. The words of which sub-section 2 gives the definition appear in sub-section 1, which provides that the Commissioner may exercise a discretion as to whether a company has been formed, among other reasons, for the purpose of evading taxation. In arriving at a decision the Commissioner takes note of the way which the shares are held, namely, as set out in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and c of sub-section 2. The word " includes " in sub-section 2 is too  embracive.  I suggest. that it be left out and the words "shall mean" inserted in its place. The word " includes " is so vague that no one knows what is included. Why not make the sub-section definite? Even if the words " shall mean " are substituted for " includes " the sub-section will still be wide in its application, for it deals with shares'held by or on behalf of various persons, or an expression of similar import. It might as well provide for shares held in any way. The language should be definite, so that the persons concerned might know what powers are vested in the Commissioner. After a company has been operating for a number of years, it should not be possible for the Commissioner to come along and say that it was formed for the purpose of evading taxation. The term " or any expression of similar import " implies that Parliament leaves to the discretion of the Commissioner matters which should be definitely set out in legislation. </para>

                        <para>. - The word "includes" is capable of a very simple explanation. Sub-section 2 is an inclusive definition. If the word " means " were substituted, the words "shares 'held by or on behalf of or any expression of similar import ", whatever their meaning according to a standard English dictionary, would have a special meaning; they would be limited to the particular classes of persons referred to in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a. b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> The insertion of the word "includes" rather than " means " transforms an exhaustive definition into an inclusive definition, but does not enlarge the common usage meaning of the words " ' by or on behalf of ' or any expression of similar import ". For the purpose of this act those words still retain the full signification to which they are entitled according to any accepted English dictionary. But in order to remove any possibility of doubt, and to enable the man in the street to know what is intended by the words " ' by or on behalf of' or any expression of similar import" the classes of persons are set out in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> andc. Surely the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> does not suggest that if we are to tax shares held ' by or on behalf of a person', we should limit those words to an extent which will not give them their full meaning. We should not limit them. It would probably be preferable to insert an inclusive definition. </para>

                        <para>- If that was the suggestion I could understand it. An inclusive definition could bring into the ordinary definitions words which would not normally be read into it. But the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is that the word "includes" gives a wider power of interpretation to the Commissioner of the words "by or on behalf of." My suggestion is that the word " includes " does nothing of the sort, but paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> may possibly rope into the definition words which might otherwise not be there. The point raised by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition was that we should have an exclusive and not an inclusive definition of those words.I suggest that that would not be proper. The inclusive definition does not give the Commissioner the right to place an interpretation on the words " by or on behalf of" other than that which would be ordinarily understood by the use of those words, except insofar as is specifically stated in the bill. Therefore, I suggest that the clause should be allowed to remain in its present form. </para>

                <para class="block">There are two points dealt with in my amendment, and I think that the first is associated with the amendment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has in mind. The rate for companies fixed by the Commissioner might be higher than the rate that would have been payable by the person concerned if the company had not been formed. My amendment is framed to correct that anomaly. I am asking that the amendment should be inserted at the end of the proposed new section, because it also concerns proposed sub-paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. As to the final paragraph of the amendment, I cite the example of a family partnership into which a man has taken his sons. Supposing that one of those sons has been acting as manager of the business or farm, as the case may be, surely he is entitled to take into consideration the salary paid to that son ? </para>

The two principles raised in my amendment are, first that when a company is declared not to be a company the rate of the tax should not be greater than would be imposed on the individual taxpayer, and secondly that the remuneration paid for services rendered by any shareholder to the company shall be an allowable deduction. </para>

They apply not to a bona fide company, but to those companies which are formed for the purpose of evading the taxation law. If a man for the deliberate purpose of evading income tax forms a company, why should this Parliament extend any consideration to him? If the offence is proved against him, why should he not be compelled to pay the full penalty for his misdeed? Where a man's son is bona fide employed in the business of a bona fide company, the salary paid is treated as a deduction in the ordinary way, but if it is not a bona fide company the effect of the amendment would be to fetter the discretion of the Taxation Commissioner. In the administration of the department a case has been discovered in which a family company made a profit of £20,000 during one year, and that profit was distributed by subterranean methods among the various shareholders. In one case known to the department, a director of a- company drawing £200 a year was only 2£ years old. </para>

The discretion of the Commissioner is absolutely limited to companies that are formed for the purpose of relieving persons from paying their just taxation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> says that the Senate is anxious to help the Government. If we are all agreed on the principle that transactions, which are not bona fide, should be controlled, why should we waste our time in considering what form of relief we can give to the man who is found to have broken the law ? Let such a man take the full consequences of what he has done. If he has formed a company for the purpose of enabling him to evade taxation, and given his daughter 200 shares in it, that daughter should be treated as his nominee. Against the decision of the Commissioner, there is an appeal to the Board of Review, but if the decision of the Commissioner, that the transaction is not bona fide, is held to be sound, why should we pass an amendment which fetters the Commissioner's discretion, and reduces the liability of the shareholder, who has nominee shareholders in a company he has formed? </para>

That is a method of legislating which is absolutely abhorrent to my ideas of what should be done. I have always understood that the wrongdoer should be made to pay the full penalty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will admit that his amendment holds out to the people, who desire to form bogus companies, the promise that if they do so and are found out they will be in no worse position from the taxation standpoint than if they had not set out to form companies for the purpose of evading taxation. Under those circumstances, bogus companies will be formed, and, if they are found out, will bless the majority in this chamber which prevented the Commissioner from taking steps which might have prevented other companies from being so formed. Before honorable senators pass the amendment, I invite them to consider the proviso in relation to the other provisions of the clause, and ask themselves whether they are acting fairly in declaring that though they are willing to prevent the formation of bogus companies for the purpose of evading taxation, they are also prepared to see that the persons who form these companies shall be in no way penalized. </para>

I agree that where the right in law has been abused and fraud perpetrated, the widest possible discretion should be given to the Commissioner to punish wrong-doers. I contend, however, that some measure of protection should be given to those who legitimately and honestly formed private companies. I am afraid there is a very definite impression abroad that those people who legitimately and honestly formed themselves into private companies are to be brought into the stockade with those other persons about whose actions we have heard so much. I do not for one moment suggest that the Government or the Commissioner intends to do them any injustice as regards happenings of the past. Proposed new section -21a provides, in sub-section l, that if the Commissioner is of the opinion that any company established after the commencement of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915, in which 90 per cent. of the paid-up capital is represented by shares held by or on behalf of not more than ten individuals has been formed for the purpose, among other things, of relieving any  person or persons from taxation, the company shall  be  deemed to  be  an individually-owned private company or a severally-owned private company, as the case may be. There is not a shadow of doubt that certain persons have formed themselves into private companies in order to secure relief from taxation; but as I have pointed out, under the law as it stood, it was  a  perfectly legitimate course to take. It came within the dictum  of Lord Sumner in  the case to which I alluded earlier in the debate this afternoon. Such action was within the law. </para>

                        <para>- I am with the honorable senator as regards the future, and if the Commissioner of  Taxation  can give us some assurance of relief in respect of those persons to whom I have directed attention, I shall have no objection. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister postpone consideration of the clause in order to confer with the Commissioner of Taxation so that we may avoid embarking on a protracted discussion on this principle. If we could vest discretion in the Minister I should be content. The Commissioner must know that, in many circumstances, the formation of private companies was a perfectly legitimate business development, and that this course was taken without intent to exploit the revenues of the Crown illegally. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE  (New South  Wales)  [5.22].  -  I cannot understand the solicitude of honorable senators opposite for those persons who have been evading taxation. I take it that the words <inline font-style="italic">"inter alia "</inline> in proposed new section 21a were inserted for the purpose of including companies which were formed for the purpose, among other things, of evading taxation. I should be sorry to think that honorable senators opposite have a soft spot in their hearts for " crooks " ; but it will be very difficult to convince the public that they have not if they persist in enlarging the loopholes by which such persons may continue to escape the legitimate taxation demands of the Commonwealth. The intention of the amendment submitted by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition is to nullify the penal provisions inserted by the Government. We take the view that those who have evaded taxation in the past should be compelled to pay in the future. This is the object of the bill. The purpose of the amendment is to prevent persons being nominees of bogus private companies from being compelled to pay the higher rate of taxation which would have been levied had the company not been formed. The object of this legislation is to prevent such tricks as that from being successful. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition and the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> would make the path of the wrongdoer as easy as ever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has argued that the formation of these private companies was a perfectly legitimate proceeding under the law. We all know that in the majority of instances the principal object the persons concerned had in view was to avoid payment of the higher rates of taxation which would have been levied upon them as individual taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>- It would relieve such persons as I have mentioned of the obligation to pay what would otherwise be a higher tax. It has been submitted only to safeguard those individuals, and to prevent them from being mulcted in the full amount, which they would otherwise pay. The effect of the amendment is to restrict the powers of the Commissioner to levy taxation upon such individuals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> said that persons associated with numerous legitimate companies are in a state of alarm because they cannot understand the proposals of the Government; but surely we are not here to legislate for the purpose of allaying people's fears. My contention is that this provision is merely to cover companies formed for the purpose, perhaps, among other things, of evading taxation. The representatives of such companies appear to have many friends opposite, who wish to assist them in indulging in this practice. As many persons, receiving slightly more than the basic wage have to pay income taxation, I cannot sympathize with those whom the Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to protect. While it is permissible for persons engaged in business to pay salaries to their own children employed in that business, yet, in the case cited by the Minister, the placing of a minor on the pay sheet clearly shows that certain bogus companies are operating to-day, and are trying to cheat the public. If loopholes are allowed to remain, heavier taxation will have to be paid by honest persons who have no desire to indulge in such practices. </para>

I am not endeavouring to deal with bogus companies which may be formed in the future, hut with genuine companies formed in the past, and which, if this clause is passed, will not be able to comply with this provision. The companies I have in mind are not bogus companies: but genuine companies operating within the law. The Minister referred to a company which had on its board of directors a child of
                    <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline>
                    years of age. I am surprised to learn that under the company law in any of the States a child of that age can be a shareholder.

Since our Income Tax Assessment Act has been in operation, a number of persons have, for various reasons, formed private companies. Such companies have been formed in some instances so that the shareholders will pay smaller amounts in income taxation than they would as individuals, which is perfectly legitimate.

                        <para>- The interests of a minor can he held only by a trustee. These companies have been formed for several purposes, one of which is to avoid paying income taxation at the rate applicable to individuals. Are we to be so hypocritical as to say that if we can lawfully reduce our income taxation we will not do so. Is any one such a smug humbug that he would not, in his own interest, do what he knew to be lawful? That is what some companies have done. They have found that perfectly legal private companies can be formed, and that in that way the taxation of the shareholders can be reduced. We are now proposing to amend the law to provide that companies formed in that way will not reap the advantage in the future. If this provision becomes law, some of these companies will go into liquidation, because their shareholders will not be able to derive the benefit of lower taxation. My amendment provides that they should not be penalized on the past year's income, because they formed a perfectly lawful company, and, by doing so were enabled to pay a reduced amount of income taxation. I can see that there is some force in the contention of the Minister that if my amendment is carried it will apply, not only to companies formed in the past, but those to be formed in the future. There would be no deterrent to persons wishing to form companies to evade income taxation. I have no desire to protect those who wish to evade the law ; or to put them in a more advantageous position than any one else. I can see, however, that if my amendment is carried it will have that effect. I suggest to the Minister, however, that private companies legitimately formed since the act has been in operation, and which are in business to-day, should not he penalized for something which has been legally done in the past. There are two classes of private companies - those legitimately formed, and those formed with the object of evading income taxation. I have no wish to protect those who wish to evade the law; hut if something can be done to protect those who in the past have legitimately formed private companies, I shall withdraw my amendment. </para>

I know that the right honorable gentleman would not utilize his position in this chamber for that purpose. I am assured by the Commissioner of Taxation that the clause will not apply to any companies that have been assessed for any past year; but that it is essential to have this provision to permit of its application to bogus companies not yet assessed for some past years. Honorable senators are aware that a well-known company is at present taking advantage of the law in this respect. Even if we agreed to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition not to allow the law to operate retrospectively, but prospectively, it would benefit taxpayers whose assessments have been deliberately held up by the department because it has not been satisfied as to the bona fides of those concerned. The policy the Government will pursue will be to interpret the provision in accordance with the definite pronouncement of the Commissioner, that I have just given. </para>

                    <para>. - Some honorable senators appear to have misunderstood the position. A man may divide his property among his children, allowing them to retain any income derivable from it, but if, later, he sees fit to form a company, he comes within the scope of this legislation, although he may have been perfectly innocent of any <inline font-style="italic">wrong</inline> intention. I wish to make my position clear. It was with no desire to assist any one to evade the law that I supported the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, but I feel that an injustice is still being done to legitimate companies. I accept the Minister's assurance as to the retrospectivity of this provision, and I ask him to extend the same consideration to cases which might arise in the future. Some of these concerns will continue to operate, and if this legislation is applied to them - and the Commissioner will have no discretion but to apply it to them - they will be penalized. I suggest that we should vest in the Commissioner some discretionary power to meet such cases. That discretion should be unfettered, for I believe that he would use it only to deal with wrong-doers. I imagine, however, that the Commissioner will find himself in difficulties with some of these private companies. While not desirous of delaying the committee, or of proposing further amendments to this clause at this stage, I suggest that the Minister should see if something can be done to vest in the Commissioner an unfettered discretionary power to deal with evil-doers. </para>

The original amendment in the bill, as introduced, was so worded that it threw the first class in the second group, and deprived salary and wage-earners of the concession if their net income exceeded £800. That was not intended. Accordingly, an amendment was moved in another place to rectify that mistake, but through a typographical error it remains.

                    <para>.- This clause seeks to amend section 23 of the principal act, which deals with deductions. During the second-reading debate I asked the Minister whether he would consent to a further addition to subparagraph ii of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of this section, which allows as deduction from assessable income gifts of £1 and upwards made to public charitable institutions, universities or colleges affiliated therewith, or to a war memorial. In that category are art galleries and museums. I have modified the proposal which I previously submitted to the Minister, in order to meet some of the objections which he urged.

                <para class="block">Probably the insertion of these words in sub-paragraph ii, before the words " to public universities ", would achieve the same purpose; I am not concerned with the manner of making the amendment, so long as it is made. The amendment does not affect gifts for the maintenance of art galleries and museums already erected in all the principal capital cities of the Commonwealth. It will apply only in the case of country towns which embark on building projects of that nature. It is undoubtedly a wise policy to decentralize art, and to give country residents an opportunity of enjoying the benefits of art galleries and museums. Any country residents who may be prepared to make the necessary sacrifice to enable such buildings to be erected might be encouraged to do so if their gifts were allowable as a deduction from assessable income. We should provide for such cases. In its legal significance the word " charitable " might even include such an institution as an art gallery; but it is better to provide specifically for the cases I have mentioned. The amendment is not likely to have much effect on the revenue, for such instances will occur only once in any particular locality. When I was Premier of Victoria, I offered a grant for the erection of buildings for the University of Melbourne, provided that a certain proportion of the cost was raised privately. At one time, no encouragement was given to public-spirited citizens to make gifts for charitable or educational purposes. The liability to pay income tax on such amounts acted as a deterrent to private benevolence. If institutions of this nature were not aided by private beneficence, the total burden would fall upon the Government. These subscriptions save the Government a great deal of expense in maintaining our universities and charitable institutions, and the same may be said with regard to art galleries. Generous citizens who make grants to public institutions of this description deserve to be encouraged. I see no logical reason why their gifts should be excluded from the list of taxation exemptions. The loss of income to the Government would be a mere bagatelle. I know the difficulties that confront the Treasurer, and realize that it is desirable that all loopholes in the act should be closed ; but this is only a trifle that I ask for. I entreat the Minister not to harden his heart, but to accept my amendment. It would be an encouragement to people to make gifts for the erection of art galleries in country districts. The exemption would not apply to gifts made to similar institutions in the metropolitan area for maintenance, and, as I have specified " building funds ", the exemption involved would not be too large. I have done that in order to encourage the Minister and the Senate to accept my amendment. </para>

                    (South Australia - Vice-President of the Executive Council) the amendment, which, on the face of it, would appear to be a perfectly reasonable one. But I ask the committee to consider the position in which the Government finds itself, and to realize the difficulties in the way of increasing existing exemptions. I point out that to assist the study of diseases in cattle is a most laudable object. Some beneficent pastoralist might come along and make a gift of £5,000 to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for that purpose; but the gift would not be exempt from taxation. A grant for the purchase of radium to assist in counteracting cancer would be another public spirited action, and there are dozens of other very fine objects that merit our recognition. However, if the Government began to exempt all gifts, from taxation it would never know where it stood. Having agreed that everybody should be taxed, the principle of exempting people simply because they make a donation to some organization is absolutely wrong. -

                        <para>- It seems most illogical to exempt the interest on such loans from income tax. If this amendment were allowed to go through, the Government would be inundated with applications for exemption from persons who had made contributions of a similar nature. I remind honorable senators that if, by this exemption, the Government sustained a loss of income to the extent of £500, that loss would have to be made up by the rest, of the taxpayers. I suggest that the difficulty is even more real than that presented by me when we were dealing with aero clubs. In view of the very urgent necessity for an equitable distribution of the burden of taxation, I ask honorable senators not to press for an extension of our exemptions, oven for such a laudable object as that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson.</inline> I suggest that it is better to restrict our exemptions until conditions improve. At present the nation cannot afford to relieve anybody of the payment of taxation. I submit that if gestures are to be the order of the day it would be a very bad gesture indeed to suggest that under these new proposals the nation is in such a position that ii can exempt from taxation certain items that were formerly taxable. That would be most unwise, and would make  the  position of the Government absolutely untenable. The time of Parliament would be taken up in deciding whether it could logically vote against certain requests for exemption advanced by, say. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> seeing that the majority of the Senate had already voted to exempt donations to art galleries. In the circumstances, I trust that the Senate will reject the amendment. </para>

But, notwithstanding the financial straits in which the Government finds itself, we should endeavour to allow reasonable deductions to certain persons who are charged with the maintenance of relatives. It has come under my notice thar there are certain taxpayers, people of small means, who have placed upon them the burden of having to maintain a parent or relative who is in indigent circumstances. The Government should make some special provision by which a reasonable deduction could be allowed such people. </para>

                        <para>- My purpose is to have an amendment inserted in the bill to provide that a taxpayer who maintains or assists to maintain a parent who is in indigent circumstances shall be allowed to deduct from his assessable income an amount not exceeding £52 per annum, provided the parent is not in receipt of an invalid or old-age pension. There are men in Australia to-day who contribute their quota of income taxation, and who, in addition to having to maintain wives and families, assist in maintaining parents who have no opportunity to take  advantage of the invalid or old-age pension. A parent, not being totally incapacitated, may not be eligible for an invalid pension, yet may have no possibility of carrying on without the assistance of a son. No deduction is allowed in respect of expenditure incurred on the maintenance of a household. The expenditure to which I am referring is entirely outside that form of domestic expenditure; it has nothing whatever to do with the maintenance of the taxpayer's home. I think we ought to encourage the spirit, alive, I am glad to say, among a certain number of our people, which leads them to suffer privations in order that their parents may be maintained in decent comfort, and to my mind, where bona fide expenditure is incurred in that direction, provided it is less than the amount of invalid or old-age pension payable, it should be allowed as a deduction from assessable income for income taxation purposes. </para>

The adoption of the honorable senator's amendment would involve a re-investigation of the whole financial position, and a re-adjustment of the. incidence of the taxation proposed. Apart from that aspect, the honorable senator seeks to confer a benefit upon a section only. </para>

                        <para>- If an injustice is to be removed, it should be removed in respect to all classes. There are many single men who support their parents; there are others who have to take the place of a father, and become the breadwinners. There is no suggestion by the honorable senator that the amounts spent by them on the maintenance of brothers or sisters should be allowed as deductions. When the previous Administration was in power, there was a suggestion that there should be a bachelor tax, with certain exceptions. But I remember reading that it was found that the field was so wide that it would pay the Government not to have such a tax. It would have involved an inquiry staff of extraordinary dimensions. No one is being unfairly taxed to-day, and, while I have every sympathy with some of the sentiments to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has given expression, I suggest that his amendment, if agreed to, would create a state of chaos. It is all very well to say that we should encourage filial affection ; but does the honorable senator suggest that a son is to Be encouraged to support his parents in order that he may avoid the payment of £2 10s. or £3 in income tax? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but the deduction allowed is not commensurate with the sacrifice made. The whole thing is so involved that, if the committee decides to accept the honorable senator's amendment, it will mean the absolute reconsideration of the incidence of taxation. If the honorable senator feels keenly about the matter, there is nothing to prevent him introducing a bill which will bring about a full inquiry into the whole of the incidence of taxation, so that, when one deduction is made, other avenues of taxation will be opened up to make up the deficiency in the revenue. </para>

ELLIOTT  (Victoria) [8.13].  -  I am sorry that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> cannot accept the amendment. The amount appropriated for old-age pensions is growing to alarming dimensions. People who make an effort to shoulder what I regard as their ordinary obligations should be given some little encouragement to do so. More and more we are departing from the doctrine that it is the duty of children to provide for their parents in their old-age, if the parents have not been able to make sufficient provision for themselves. It is becoming a practice for people who can afford to support their parents to look solely to the State for their maintenance. They say, "Why should we do anything of the sort when we are taxed to support the parents of others, as well as our own ?" </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Minister takes the view that the amendment will complicate the work of the department, and involve a reconsideration of the Government's financial proposals. Already there is provision in the act to allow as deductions contributions to charitable' institutions. I see no reason why the same principle should not be extended to contributions by sons to the support of their parents to the extent of, at most, £52 a year. Surely it is a stretch of the imagination to suggest that the question is an involved one. The income tax forms for the preparation of returns provide for certain deductions. No valid reason has been advanced why a taxpayer should not  be  allowed to include an amount paid towards the maintenance of his parents up to the sum stated. If necessary, he could attach a statutory declaration to satisfy the Commissioner that such payments had been made. When we are considering amendments to the act we should, whenever possible, remove any inequalities, so as to place the burden of taxation more evenly upon the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">In an appeal case, <inline font-style="italic">Gordon v. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> which came before the High Court of Australia recently, the court held that subscriptions paid to the Graziers Association was a reasonable business outgoing, and should be allowed as a deduction. The provisions contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which I desire the committee to reject, were inserted to meet the position created by the High Court decision. In some explanatory notes furnished by the Commissioner of Taxation, it is pointed out that expenditure is often incurred for the representation of such associations before the Arbitration Court for the purpose of contesting demands of employees for increased wages, and not for the production of assessable income. I put it to honorable senators that expenditure so incurred is equivalent to expenditure for the production of assessable income. Trading associations are almost essential to the conduct of modern business, which is tending towards collectivism. The activities of such bodies are entirely due to the fact that they contribute something to the carrying on of a business. The provisions in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> are intended to meet a position created by the decision of the High Court in the Gordon case - a decision with which, I suggest, no person with common sense can be in disagreement. The manner in which the proposed new provisions are presented is convincing evidence of the intricacies of income tax legislation generally. I direct attention particularly to the proviso.

                    B. JOHNSTON (Western Australia [8.28].  -  I support the amendment. The new provisions have been inserted by the department for the purpose of upsetting the decision of the High Court in an appeal by the Commissioner against a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In that case a pastoralist named Gordon appealed against the decision of the Commissioner of Taxation who disallowed as a deduction the amount paid in membership subscription to the Graziers Association of New South Wales. Three judges of the High Court, including
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                    Isaacs, upheld the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The Graziers Association has spent a considerable amount of time and money in contesting in a constitutional manner the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. The association contended that the expenditure in subscriptions was incurred for the protection of assessable income. As such I. submit that it should certainly be allowed. It is extraordinary that since that decision in favour of the members of an association who had banded themselves together for protection, the Government has brought down an amendment designed to defeat a judgment of the High Court. It is also particularly surprising that this action should be taken by a Government which is forcing public servants to join organizations in order to obtain the benefits of awards of the Public Service Arbitrator. Surely if it is right for public servants to join an association in order to protect their interests, it should , also be beneficial for the pastoralists and farmers to join an organization to safeguard their interests. The men on the land .would be in a much worse position than they are to-day if it were not for the work which has been continually carried out by an association of which they are members, particularly in advocating their claims before the Arbitration. Court. The High Court has decided that the subscriptions paid by members of this association are legitimate deductions. Prom- the Government's viewpoint the total revenue involved is infinitesimal, and from the point of view of the men on the land who are members of this association, and who are urged to join it; this privilege is essential. Although workers who do not join a trade union organization are ignored by this Government and its supporters, it has submitted this amendment to discourage another section of the community from joining a legitimate organization established to safeguard the interests of its members. If they do their contributions cannot be deducted from their taxable income. I trust that the amendment moved by

                    <para>. - I trust that the committee will not be misled by the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that this paragraph is inserted with the intention of over-riding a decision of the High Court in the case which he quoted. It is not. The High Court was asked to interpret the law as it then stood. The function of the Parliament is to frame the law, and that of the court to interpret it. The practice has been to hold that a subscription to the Graziers Association is not <inline font-style="italic">per se</inline> an expenditure incurred in producing the assessable income of the subscriber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> was a member of the Government that administered this provision. Will the honorable senator suggest that deductions should be made of amounts which are not spent in the production of income? The Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> was a member went further in this connexion, and administered a section providing that a deduction should be disallowed on the grounds that the taxpayer had not shown that any part of the subscription was used by the association in common with other subscriptions and other incomes of the association to defray the cost of any activity of the association carried out on behalf of the subscribing members, which, if carried out by a member, would be an activity, the expenses of which would be an allowable deduction to that person under the act. The Full High Court in dealing with this provision ruled that the legislation provided that such deduction could be made by the taxpayer, and that decision will be faithfully observed by this Government so long as the legislation remains in its present form. The Government, in framing its budget, distributed taxation as equitably as possible on the assumption that Parliament would adhere to the practice which has been in operation for many years. If honorable senators opposite attempt to upset this provision, it will create chaos. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> asked why a lawyer should  not be allowed to deduct his subscription to the Law Society, or a medical practitioner his contributions to the British Medical Association. I am a member of the Law Society of South Australia, but it cannot be held that it is necessary for me to be a member of that society to enable me to earn ari income. That society exists for the protection of its members, as do other similar societies. It is a condition precedent to practising as a barrister or solicitor, but membership is not compulsory. If unnecessary exemptions are permitted the burden of taxation of others must necessarily he increased. The committee has not to decide whether the Government is introducing legislation to override a decision of the High Court; but whether the present practice is inconsistent with the law as expressed by the legislature. As it is inconsistent with the letter of the law, the committee is now asked to determine whether it shall be allowed to remain in its present form, and deductions, such as those mentioned, allowed. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In framing the amendment it was necessary to preserve existing rights of deductions expressly permitted by the law, namely, deductions of contributions to any society registered under any friendly societies' act of the Commonwealth or a State (section 23 (1) <inline font-style="italic">g).</inline> These rights are preserved hy the terms of subparagraph <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ea</inline> proposed to be inserted by amendment <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> under clause 12. </para>
                <para>Paragraph 2 will cover stock and sharebrokers who are obliged to pay annual subscriptions to the stock exchange as a condition precedent to being permitted to exercise their callings. Practitioners' fees paid to the Supreme Court are allowable deductions, as are licence fees paid by certain persons following other occupations. It was never intended by the legislature that payments to such associations as the Growers Association, the Law Society, or the British Medical Association should be deducted from assessable incomes. If that were permissible, doctors, chemists and many other professional men would claim a similar right. Subparagraph iii, referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> provides in statutory form for the continuance of the present depart- mental practice of allowing a deduction to the taxpayer of so much of his subscription to the relevant association as bears to the whole of that subscription the same proportion as the expenditure incurred by the association in carrying out the activity specified in the provision, bears to the total expenses of the association for the year. The activity specified in the provision is an activity of the association which, if performed individually by the member, would represent an activity, the expenditure upon which would be a deduction in the assessment of that member, namely, advertising, advising as to best buying and future market prospects, collection of debts, investigating customers' financial positions, engaging labour, and engaging transport. Honorable senators will see that what we consider to be the legal right of taxpayers to make a deduction has been preserved. If it is correct to say that it was always clear that the subscriptions of graziers to their associations were proper deductions, why did the previous Government continue this legislation? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is wrong. The departmental practice for many years prior to the High Court's decision was not to allow them as deductions. It is for Parliament to decide whether, in view of the state of the finances, it will allow graziers, lawyers, chemists, doctors, and others to claim subscriptions paid to their associations as deductions' against their incomes. Any man who can afford to join an association at the present time is indeed fortunate. </para>

                        <para>- No. For example, there is no compulsion on a lawyer to join the Law Society. Indeed, many lawyers are not members of that society; yet they remain in business. Probably there are many graziers who are not members of the Graziers Association. My contention is that these subscriptions should not be allowed as deductions unless made for the purpose of earning income. There is no more reason why they should be deductible than there is for the  deduction of the fees paid by a politician to a golf club to keep him physically fit. I have told the Senate how serious the financial position is, and how necessary it is therefore that deductible items shall not be increased. If honorable senators are not prepared to assist the Government in this matter, they must accept the responsibility. I urge them not to allow these payments as deductions. </para>

                        <para>- Such subscriptions are not allowable deductions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> suggests that some adjustments must be made. How can adjustments be made seeing that the organizations to which these payments are made are not required to lodge returns? Will the department have to ascertain what proportion a member's subscription bears to the total amount of work done on his behalf? In the New South Wales legislation deductions of this kind are limited to £50. That is in keeping with the trend of modern business. Contributions to organizations, such as the Pastoralists Association, are reasonable business outgoings. Men do not make these payments for amusement; they expect some practical results from their contributions. </para>

The association not only assists graziers with regard to industrial matters ; it also provides them with advice which enables them to improve their stock pastures and business generally. . On occasions the Government has brought experts from overseas ' to report on pastoral matters, and the investigations carried out by these experts have generally been conducted through the pastoral organizations. I remember Professor  Thieler  and an officer of the London County Council coming to this country, and portion of their work was done through the graziers' associations. From time to time members of the association meet and discuss problems associated with their industry. </para>

                    <para>. - Owing to the limited time that the Government has at its disposal prior to the termination of the session, and the very considerable amount of business that has to be dealt with during that period, it was not my intention to participate in this debate. However, the remarks of honorable senators opposite on this amendment impel me to do so. The financial affairs of Australia are in a state of chaos, and we are faced with a staggering adverse trade balance, neither of which can be attributed to any maladministration on the part of the present Government, which has occupied the treasury bench only for the last ten months. The Government finds it necessary to effect economies in all directions and to raise revenue wherever it is possible to do so, in order to honour the legacy of obligations bequeathed to it by its predecessors in office. At such a time one would naturally expect all to work for the furtherance of the common weal. Yet, when the Government brings down a measure for the purpose of tightening up income taxation, honorable senators opposite go out of their way to indulge in special pleading on behalf of their political supporters. Never was parochialism more ill-timed. Here we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> pleading the case of the unfortunate lawyers, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Glasgow drawing a pathetic picture of the distressed pastoralists, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> painting a harrowing picture of the crippled business interests of Western Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman,</inline> in a melancholy dirge, lamenting the hardships imposed upon the graziers of South Australia! What of the men who are on the basic wage - those who really do bear the heat and burden of the day? Have honorable senators opposite, no thought for them? I am reminded of a cartoon that I once saw in that exceptionally clever political journal, <inline font-style="italic">Punch.</inline> The artist depicted a woman, with her arms in the washtub. About her he built up the structure of society. In all directions the poor unfortunate worker was shown to be bearing the burden of the community. Tha,t very truthful piece of symbolism holds good to-day. The workers hear the burden, first, last, and always. I cannot recall having 3een any graziers or lawyers waiting upon benevolent societies to draw their bags of rations, nor have I seen them thrust out of any queue when endeavouring to replace their rags with discarded clothing that was being issued for those in distress. On the other hand I can remember, that, from 1922 until the latter part of 1929. our pastoralists enjoyed bountiful seasons and were literally rolling in wealth. The Bruce-Page Administration found itself with overflowing Treasury coffers. It rapidly dissipated that wealth, and when this Government assumed office, it was in the position of old Mother Hubbard. It went to the cupboard, and found it bare. Now when it endeavours, by tightening up the incidence of taxation, to counteract the policy of drift into which its predecessors had lapsed, its efforts are subjected to the vociferous protests of honorable senators opposite. We have had debated to-day the advisability of exempting the profits of aero clubs, and the expenditure of graziers. It might as well be claimed that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I were prominent officials of a workers' Christmas club, and we presented the organization with a Christmas ham that cost us 25s., we should be justified in claiming that expenditure as a reasonable deduction from our earnings, for income tax purposes. Unfortunately the Government in the Senate is overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. Honorable senators opposite, counting the  President,  number 29. We on the Government side number but 7, and must bow in the main to the arrogance of a brutal majority. Had the ex-Prime Minister, the Right Honorable S. M. Bruce- </para>

Had there been a double, instead of a single, dissolution last year, this party would have been returned with a majority in both Houses. Why should not trade unionists receive some concessions? It is no use trying to disguise the truth. If honorable senators opposite feel in the mood to emasculate this amending bill, or to throw it out altogether, that will be done. It is nauseating to me to have to listen to the doleful wail of honorable senators opposite, because their lament is absolutely unwarranted. If I hear many more tales of the character indulged in by honorable senators opposite, I shall have to borrow a handkerchief to hide my tears. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to correct a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> who quoted as his authority for it a statement made in another place. I have made inquiries from the taxation office and find that the particular deduction to which he refers has never been allowed by the federal taxation authorities. The Leader of the Opposition in another place was confused with regard to the combined form used for taxation returns, which shows income for both State and Federal purposes. This item has been an allowable deduction by the New South Wales Government, but never by the federal authorities. Although insistent demands were made for such a deduction by the Graziers Association, the previous Federal Government refused to allow it. The prevailing practice has been in operation ever since the Federal Government entered the taxation arena. I can assure the honorable senator that the statement was made in error by the Leader of the Opposition in another place. This deduction has never been allowed. The previous Government resolutely refused to override the decision of the Commissioner, and the practice was followed for years until the High Court discovered that it was not in accordance with the letter of the law. This amendment has been introduced to continue the practice. It is not to introduce some new burden of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- But the suggestion now is that, instead of the whole of the subscription being allowed as a deduction in accordance with the present law, some involved system of calculation is to be worked out and a man is to be allowed to deduct part of his subscription. The Government should not quibble over trifles of this nature. I do not think it should expect the pastoralists to consult their associations in order to ascertain what proportion of the subscription should be allowed. Although it is only a small matter an important principle is at stake. The subscription is clearly paid by the pastoralist or the farmer for the protection of his income  and I hope that the committee will agree to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> particularly as the Government admits the justice of the principle by saying that it will allow a deduction in respect of a proportion of the subscription. </para>

That was the departmental practice, and it is the practice which we intend to continue. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> appreciates the significance of the proposal when he says that it is only a small matter.

                        <para>- It is not in every case that a concession is allowed to be deducted from both Federal and State income tax returns. There are deductions which are unmistakable deductions in both cases; but in this particular case it is. a concession we are asked to grant. The fact that some involved calculations may be required does not enter into the question. There is a principle at stake - whether this particular deduction is to be allowed or whether the Government is to be forced into the position of having to impose further taxation on industries that can least afford to pay it in order that an exemption may be granted to graziers, doctors and others, who can afford to pay taxation. </para>

                <para>The proposed new sub-section differs from that in the bill as printed in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> only. The balance of the subsection is the same as appears in the bill except that the bill does not show the terms paragraphed into <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> It is considered desirable to have the matter set out in paragraphs on account of the length of the text, and also, because three different subjects are mentioned. The purport of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is explained in the printed explanatory notes, which have been issued. Paragraph c is inserted, because profit from isolated sales of property which had been acquired for re-sale at a profit is now to be treated as taxable income. Conversely a loss resulting from a similar operation should be treated as a loss to be deducted from assessable income, if any, of the taxpayer in the same year, or in the absence of such income, then as a loss to be carried forward into succeeding years to be deducted from the profits of those years as far as may be necessary to extinguish the loss within the four years next succeeding the year in which it is sustained. It has been the depart mental practice to allow a deduction of those losses in all past assessments, but it is considered desirable to have statutory authority for the practice, having regard to the fact that isolated transactions yielding taxable profit may not, in some cases, be classifiable strictly as businesses. Section 26 of the principal act in its present form allows deduction in respect of losses in businesses only. </para>

We all recall the fierce election battle over this issue during the last campaign, and the allegations made by Labour candidates that the Bruce-Page Administration intended to tax the people's amusements.

It has been told so often that, in  the words  of  that  popular phonograph record in which the " Two Black Crows " are heard, we are now inclined to say, "Why bring that up?" The Labour party won the last election  on  its declared policy. </para>

We take the view that the American film interests, in common with any other corporation that operates in this country, should pay its fair share to  the  revenue by means  of  income taxation. Another company, known as. " Union Pictures," gives preference, wherever possible,  to  British films. </para>

The sole object of this provision is to reach those who are endeavouring to avoid taxation. The language used is sufficiently comprehensive to cover what is required.  It  does not constitute a reflection on Great Britain, but is simply to define a class of company that must pay taxation in this form.  It  does not matter whether such companies are operating in the dominions or in America. They have no right to form subsidiary companies for the purpose of evading taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I daresay that would happen ; but I am voicing the opinion of taxpayers 2,000 miles away from the Seat of Government, and who have not an opportunity of personally expressing their views to the taxation authorities at Canberra. In a country district in Western Australia  in  which I lived for years many of the activities on farms and pastoral properties are carried on by legitimate family partnerships. In a great many instances deeds of partnership have not even been drawn up. In some cases I may have been personally responsible because I know the people, and understood their intention when the partnership was formed. In many instances these persons merely registered the partnerships in the local court, each member of the firm signing the registration form,  and  under the title approved by the local court, carried on business indefinitely,  Bay,  as John Smith and Sons. In some cases properties are in the father's name. Forms are filled in establishing a partnership in the farm which belongs to the father, who in many instances retires to the city or to a neighbouring country town. Although such partnerships have been in existence for many years the Commissioner may, if in his opinion they are evading taxation, to use an expression of the Minister, declare them to be illegal or bogus partnerships. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Commissioner's main consideration would be the position of the Consolidated Revenue, and probably the revenue has suffered because the law has always been carried out in this way. If some of these farmers had been aware of the proposed amendment of the law they would have divided their properties among their sons as they really intended to do. Under this provision the Commissioner can declare illegal what is a perfectly natural and legal partnership between members of families. The average young man of" 21 or 22 has not any capital, and in a great many cases men have placed their sons on the land under a form of partnership. There are many pastoral, grazing, and farming properties which are worked by the sons while the fathers reside in adjacent country towns. Is it to be a crime for a parent to establish his son on the land without handing the property over to him altogether? A father may pay to fit his son for a profession, and no objection is raised; he may spend thousands of pounds in purchasing a partnership for his son in the city and there is no complaint ; but should a man in the country establish his son on his property under some family arrangement, he is liable to be penalized. Every clause that we have tightened up has been directed against the man on the land. Properties leased from the Crown are to be liable to taxation whenever they are transferred, but no provision of that nature is to apply to freehold property in and near our cities. Only in the outlying portions of Australia, where people cannot obtain freehold, is this excessive taxation to apply. I object strongly to the measure, because it aims at piling up burdens on the man on the land, while, at the same time, it will not affect people living in or near the cities who own freehold. Clause 2 will not affect persons who have established their children in professions, but it will injure primary producers in the country who work under a system of family partnerships. We are asked to. say that the Commissioner may declare to be illegal that which is not only perfectly natural, but is also lawful. The Commissioner may apply a provision of this nature to any partnership between relatives or affecting relatives. I shall oppose the clause because I believe that it strikes a blow at people in the country who desire to work their land under an honest arrangement with relatives or members of their families. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Moreau</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> the court held that the opinion of the Commissioner could not be questioned. This provision will embarrass 99 honest family partnerships to every case of evasion that it will meet. Some of the persons affected by this legislation live at long distances from the cities. If they are called upon to explain their partnerships they will be forced to incur heavy  expenditure in visiting the city. I hope that the clause will be rejected. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales [10.3].  -  We have listened to a doleful story of an alleged attack on persons living in the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> would have us believe that this clause is aimed directly at the few simple individuals who work their farms under a system of family partnerships. I remind him that it will affect only those partnerships which have been formed for the purpose of evading taxation. The honorable senator suggests that, in many cases, these partnerships are formed to carry on the family inheritance when the father has retired to the city or elsewhere and leaves his sons to carry on the farm. Such family arrangements are scarcely partnerships at all. No particular merit or blame attaches to a man who inherits his father's possessions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is absolutely incorrect in saying that this clause is aimed at the man on the land. We have just dealt with a clause which aims at meeting the cases of private companies which attempt to evade taxation. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> suggest that such companies are mainly composed of men on the land? It is a false deduction on his part to charge the Government with a desire to injure farmers and others by this legislation. If, by forming partnerships, country dwellers can evade taxation, persons living in the cities are as likely to form partnerships for the same purpose. For instance, I could enter into partnerships with my sons to carry on some nominal business if thereby we could secure exemptions otherwise unobtainable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> must be suffering from " imaginitis." If we decline to agree to this clause, we should go back and repeal the previous clauses dealing with companies, because the two provisions are complementary. Those who have escaped taxation hitherto are lucky that they have not been found out sooner. They should not whine about what might happen to them in the future. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> said, those who might suffer from this legislation live away from the cities, and have no representation in this Parliament, I ask him what he is doing here? </para>

It is true that there can be an appeal to the Board of Review, but that body is largely comprised of departmental officers, who are likely to view taxation matters from a departmental stand-point. In every other case in which his property is concerned, the taxpayer has a right of appeal to a court. He should have the same right of appeal in cases in which, by an opinion or decision of the Commissioner, his property is affected. I shall listen with interest to the objections that the Minister may raise to this amendment. In my opinion, it gives the taxpayers a right which they should possess. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am surprised at the right honorable gentleman pressing his amendment. When he first referred to it, he was under the impression that there was no statutory board of review. Now his objection is that that board is largely composed of departmental officers. I submit that the right honorable gentleman's statements are an indictment of the previous Government. It was in 1922 that that Government, of which the right honorable gentleman was a member, suggested that it was impracticable for the High Court to decide these matters. Consequently, that Government appointed three men as a board of review. At the time the right honorable gentleman suggested that they were men who would hold the scales evenly between the taxpayer and the department. I have already given the personnel of that board, and have challenged the right honorable senator to show one letter of protest raised by any chamber of commerce, or taxpayers' association, against anything that it has done. To dismiss this board summarily and to say to the High Court that in future not only has a taxpayer the right of appeal to it, but that that court shall hear and determine all questions arising out of any opinion given by the Commissioner, would be to impose upon this Government a task that the previous Government was not prepared to undertake - the necessity to find the money to pay the salaries of the judges whose services would be required,onorable  senators know that in order to maintain the high standard that has been built up by the High Court it would be necessary to employ the best brains in the legal .fraternity. At a time when Australia is suffering from severe financial distress, and when the High Court itself is prepared to work undermanned in order to help the nation, the Government is asked to sack this Board of Review, for that is what it amounts to. </para>

                        <para>- And eventually there will be an appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Supreme Court judge. Why should Parliament chop and change about in these matters? What reasons have been advanced for breaking away from a system that was introduced by our predecessors in office? This Government did not introduce the Board of Review, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> states that these men have forgotten the very high and onerous judicial office that they are supposed to perform. The right honorable senator said that they are merely departmental officers. One is a barrister-at-law, who was a special magistrate in Western Australia; another is a very highly-qualified accountant, brought from Tasmania, while the third is a taxation expert. I believe that the reputation of each is unimpeachable. What evidence has been adduced before this Senate which would lead any reasonable man to vote against the proposals of this Government, and to justify this Senate breaking away from the prevailing system? I submit, only that of caprice. Of course, if the Opposition choose to deal with the subject capriciously, as apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> proposes to do, no argument that I can advance will change their attitude. Honorable senators know that if this system had not met with the approval of the chambers of commerce and the taxpayers generally, there would have been objections against it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> referred to the telegrams that he has received from different associations, but he is not able to quote any objection to the action of this Board of Review. </para>

If the determinations of the Board of Review were satisfactory, these appeals would never see the light of day. Having regard to the drastic nature of the amendments that we have made to the principal act with the assistance, in some cases, of the Opposition, I feel that the commercial community will be uneasy.

                        <para>- I do not think that we should drag into the discussion the men who are holding that office. As an individual representing the people of South Australia, I shall not submit to any dictation by any institution connected with the finances of Australia, though I am prepared to support those bodies to the utmost limits in order to  prevent evasion of the law. After all, this is merely the old fight of the individual against the Crown. Surely, if the department is acting in good faith, and I believe that it is, there is nothing to fear from this right of appeal. Surely if the Minister is right there will not be many appeals from the decisions of the Board of Review, but having regard to the far-reaching powers conferred by this legislation on the Commissioner of Taxation, I think there should be some judicial redress for individual taxpayers.

                    <para>Throughout the bill added powers are given to the Commissioner to act on opinions formed by him. It ought to be competent for taxpayers if dissatisfied, to appeal either to the court or to the Board of Review. At present, appeal is limited to a Board of Review, the members of which are all Government appointees "on short term of office. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister asks for evidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Spencer Watts,  chairman  of the taxation section of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, has also forwarded a letter, the terms of which are similar to those forwarded to the Prime Minister. There is no desire to have appeals to the courts on all sorts of minor matters. I think the Leader of the Opposition would be satisfied if they were granted from the determinations of the Board of Review to give the taxpayers an opportunity to enjoy a right which taxpayers have under every other form of taxation legislation with which I am familiar. The Board of Review  -  I speak subject to correction - came into being as the outcome of our Land Tax Assessment Act. Land tax appeals were taking up a great deal of time of the court, and an endeavour was made to reduce the number of small appeals in which no important questions, or no matters of vital interest were raised, by handing them to a board of departmental officers, as it was at first constituted. Later on the system was amended, and I understand a stipendiary magistrate was chosen as chairman of the board. </para>

                        <para>- After functioning for a while, a board of review is liable to accept the departmental view point, whereas I stand for the judicial determination as against the departmental viewpoint. If an individual who has lost an appeal is satisfied with the decision of the Board of Review, or takes no further steps in the matter, it is obvious that the board has done justice, or that in contesting the matter before the board his eyes have been opened to the weakness of his case. We allow an appeal from the decision of the Board of Review in regard to assessments, but not in regard to far-reaching questions in which the reputation of people, their honesty and their integrity are to an extent involved - when, in effect, they have been found guilty of a crime. In regard to these matters the decision in regard to which rests with the Commissioner - surely the taxpayer should have the same right of appeal as he has when it is simply a matter of pounds, shillings and pence. Clause 19 makes very wide provision for the opening up and alteration of assessments. It is a provision which is not found in the taxation law of Great Britain. An alteration may be made " where the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been an avoidance of tax . . . due to fraud or evasion." It seems to me to be a very far-reaching power to give to any person, no matter what trust we have in him, and no matter what capacity he may possess. In all British legislation a discretion of this sort has always been controlled by the judiciary. </para>

The right honorable senator says that the court cannot decide on the facts, but in proper cases the High Court can give leave to appeal on the facts. It did so in Gordon's case. </para>

I agree with the right honorable senator that the High Court is not going into every question of fact in respect to every assessment made by the Commissioner of Taxation. But it is for the court to decide whether on the facts the case is of sufficient magnitude to be heard by it. For instance, it may be shown that the Commissioner in the course of his investigation has done something contrary to the law. Surely it is not desired that every disgruntled taxpayer should have the right to waste the time of the High. Court on appeals when there is no question of law arising in connexion with an assessment. </para>

                        <para>- If, in the exercise of that discretion which is reposed in him, the Commissioner does something which it can be shown to the High Court is a wrongful exercise of his power, it becomes a question of law. The admission or rejection of any particular evidence which may be necessary to enable the Commissioner to arrive at a particular decision is a question of law or may he so in the opinion of the High Court. The facts would be considered first and the judgment given upon the facts, plus the inferences. The Gordon case involved questions of fact. The High Court should be in a position to refuse to hear frivolous appeals. It was never intended that it should be open to any disgruntled taxpayer who might not be satisfied with the assessment or the mathematical accuracy of the formula adopted by the Commissioner. That should be a matter for the Board of Review. The statement submitted by the Sydney Chamber of Commerce does not in any way reflect on the Board of Review. What has happened since the board was established to cause honorable senators who, at that time, favoured the scheme to object to it now? Are they simply objecting to it because it has been brought forward by this Government ? </para>

                        <para>- It said nothing about the findings of the Board of Review. I do not infer that its findings have always given universal satisfaction, because a litigant appealing to the High Court would be more or less disgruntled at the decision of the board. The mere fac that some taxpayers are dissatisfied with the decisions of the board cannot be regarded as evidence that its judgments are unfair. The board was established by the previous Government, and, until tonight, I have heard no complaints from those honorable senators who were either members or supporters of that Government as to its inefficiency or unsuitability for the duties which it is called upon to discharge. It would appear, therefore, that this amendment has been brought forward for the purpose mainly of harassing the Government. It is one of the most unreasonable that has been submitted during this debate. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> mentioned the position of the taxpayer who might be accused of wilful evasion of the law. In such an event, there would be the right of appeal to the court on questions of law, and the court would determine whether or not the Commissioner was justified in arriving at his decision on the facts as presented to him. In some instances, a taxpayer might consider it expedient to suffer grievances rather than to go to the expense of seeking the remedy. I was in that, position myself some years ago, when, as an employee, I was required to punch the bundy. On two or three occasions, owing to a fault in the mechanism, I was marked as being late. Rather than go over to the Town Hall in my own time, a proceeding that would have involved a delay of two hours, I preferred to suffer a deduction in pay amounting to a quarter of an hour. Whether or not the High Court will deal with all cases submitted to it must depend upon the manner in which the Board of Review arrives at its finding. If the board went out of its way to inflict an injustice on any taxpayer, or make an accusation of criminal evasion of the act. questions of law would be involved, and these would be determined by the court. </para>

If I am entangled by the dispute between members of the legal fraternity, surely it is the duty of those who have some knowledge of the subject to remove the entanglements. I should think that a man charged with evading a taxation law would be guilty of an indictable offence, for which he could be heavily fined, or imprisoned. If honorable senators possessed of legal knowledge wish to keep it to themselves they cannot be surprised if we object to their very complicated presentation of a case. </para>

            <para class="block">The object of this amendment is to permit taxpayers to make their payments to the Taxation Department in two instalments, the first of which is to be paid within 60 days after receipt of the assessment and the second within six months of the payment of the first instalment. Under the present system many taxpayers find it embarrassing, and at times exceedingly difficult, to pay their income taxation within the time provided in the existing act. If this amendment were adopted it would allow commercial men particularly to have the use of their money in their businesses for a little longer, and would also relieve them of the responsibility of meeting their assessments in what I consider an unnecessarily short period. Practically every person in the community is at present receiving a reduced income, and an amendment such as I have moved would be of considerable benefit to practically every taxpayer in the Commonwealth. The department will probably contend that extra expenditure will be incurred in the collection of income taxation. The department would as at present, send out the assessments. At the end of 60 days the first instalment would be paid, and the second payment would be made within six months thereafter. It will also be  contended that the Treasury would he without revenue from this source for a longer period; but that would he compensated for by the fact that the money which, in the ordinary course, would be paid into Consolidated Revenue would be used in trade and commerce generally, and would, therefore, be of indirect advantage to the Commonwealth. The amendment, if adopted, will afford considerable relief to the taxpayers without causing any great inconvenience to the department, and I trust that it will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- It is serious. Do honorable senators realize that it will involve the Government in an additional £50,000 in issuing assessments and receipts? The  Deputy  Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that if this proposal is carried, it will increase the expenditure of the department by at least £50,000. There is another, and more serious, objection to it. The Government has budgeted to meet certain commitments. Those commitments are based on the collection of income tax within a certain time. As taxpayers are treated by the Commissioner with the utmost leniency, at no time is there need to legislate in the manner suggested. But to attempt to do so now is to act unreasonably. The Government is facing a financial crisis. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they do; and their interests must be considered. I know that a majority of honorable senators can defeat the Government on this amendment ; but, if the amendment is carried, the bill might  as  well be thrown out. No government could carry on in such circumstances. How could it budget under this time-payment system? I ask honorable senators to give to this Government that consideration which they would give to another government in normal times. The Government cannot accept the amendment, and it is too late to postpone the consideration of the clause. If the amendment is insisted on, then the Government will have to tell the people that it cannot find the. money. I have just received a further note from the Commissioner of Taxation, in which he states that if the amendment is carried only one half of the revenue from income taxation will be collected this year. The Government can put up with an amendment providing for appeals to the High Court, but it cannot submit to treatment of this kind. I say that in no threatening spirit. The Senate knows that the Government cannot afford to pay1d. extra for the collection of taxes. The Commissioner of Taxation tells me that £50,000 is a conservative estimate. </para>

Does the Minister seriously say that it will cost one-eighth of the total expenditure of the department to give the taxpayers a chance to pay their taxes in two instalments?

I submit that that is not a reasonable request. It would throw the financial arrangements of the Government into chaos. One's income tax assessment always comes at a most inopportune time, and that can also be said of electric light bills and rate notices. With all due respect to the mover of the amendment, I submit that it is not a reasonable thing to ask the Government for eight months credit in which to pay one's income tax assessment. </para>

I know, too, that in many cases quite a lengthy period elapses between the lodging of the return and the arrival of the assessment. Last year I sent in  my return by the 30th June, but did not receive the assessment until nearly Christmas, after which I had 60 to 90 days in which to pay. By the time I had paid both my Federal and State taxes it was very nearly time to lodge my next return. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> that there never is an opportune time to pay a tax. However, the long delay did me no good.

                    <para>.- This bill is practically a replica of two measures I had the honour of introducing during the regime of the late Government. It is thus the third occasion on which the measure has been considered by this chamber, and I do not propose to dwell at any length upon its provisions. There is one feature to which I should direct attention, particularly at this juncture in the affairs of the nation. I had a feeling when we were dealing with the measure earlier that we were providing generous allowances in respect of injuries to workmen in the employment of the Commonwealth, by adopting the mean of the compensations provided for under the various State workers' compensation acts. It was thought that, for the Commonwealth to do otherwise, would be to set an extravagant example to the States. No one desires to have any reduction in the scale of compensation; but in this bill the Federal Government has seen fit to establish, not merely a generous, but a lavish scale of compensation at a time when the public purse can ill afford it, and when the taxpayer, who is, usually, the last person thought about, is wilting under the financial stress of the times. The scale of compensation proposed excels that provided in the New South Wales law, which was previously regarded as the last word in lavishness. It is, however, the only criticism that I have to offer to this measure. It seems to me we are, by the schedule now proposed, setting an example to the States which they cannot afford to follow, and it is very doubtful whether we should embark upon it at a time when the finances are strained. I grant that the amounts are not large. Increases of £50 here and £100 there in the multitude of accidents which I suppose occur in the Public Service do not seem very much; but they run into a considerable sum of money before the end of each financial year. Provision has been made in this bill for fixing the compensation in respect of certain injuries, and it is to. those I particularly point, because of their lavishness. However, the Government must take the responsibility. If times were good we could go to the full limit in safeguarding the interests of the maimed and injured ; but, when everybody is more or less suffering from financial strain, and the Government itself is imposing grievous burdens on the people, I think it would have been advisable to call a halt, or stop at what I, when introducing this bill a couple of years ago, regarded as a generous allowance in respect of these injuries. The bill itself has been a trifle unlucky in the past. It has, on two occasions, been carried by this chamber, and gone down to another place where, because of circumstances that have arisen, no opportunity has been given for its consideration. Perhaps on this occasion it will meet with a happier fate. </para>

                    <para>. - I am pleased that the honorable senator does not intend to offer any factious opposition to this bill; but he claims that, because of the financial stringency now existing, it is not a proper time to give the compensation provided for in it. I claim that it is just the time when we should secure some measure of justice for those who are deprived of their bread-winners. If the Public Service is to be fairly and decently treated in regard to those who meet with accidents, no time can be too soon to mete out that justice. It is only those whose means are very limited who can realize the tragedy that results when bread-winners meet with severe accidents, or even death. Consequently, the least the Commonwealth can do in times of stress is to see that we should give, not merely fair, but also generous consideration to those who become injured in the pursuance of their duties as public servants. I trust that during the course of the bill through committee we shall not haggle over the amounts of compensation proposed to be paid. In fact, in some cases I think it would be good sense to somewhat increase the amounts set out in the schedules. They may be in excess of what have hitherto been provided; but I do not think that any one would care to suffer mutilation for the sake of securing them. </para>

It is,I think, generally admitted that the Commonwealth should extend to its employees the same measure of relief as is given to employees outside the Public Service and whatever may be the consequences we shall stand up to our obligations. </para>

The previous Government considered it desirable to appoint a commissioner to deal with this matter and this Government approved of its proposal. We believe that the provisions relating to compensation payable to Commonwealth employees should be brought into harmony with similar measures in operation in the different States. </para>

I suggest that some safeguard is needed in this clause to protect the interests of the public. The duly-qualified medical practitioner mentioned in the clause would probably be the family doctor, who has to say that an employee is suffering from a disease. If he were employed in a particular process at the time of incapacity, it would be assumed that the disease was caused by employment in that work. A reference to the schedule will show that the man may have had the disease before entering the employment of the Commonwealth. A person may, on entering the Postal Department and engaging in one of the processes mentioned, be suffering from a disease. He might then get the family doctor to certify that he is suffering from a particular complaint, and may be entitled to compensation to an amount up to £700. </para>

                    PEARCE.It is the responsibility of the department to prove to the contrary. There is a danger of collusion between the medical practitioner and the employee. The clause should provide that the medical practitioner should be a health or quarantine officer, or such other medical officer as is prescribed. I do not wish to interfere with the payment of compensation to those suffering from occupational diseases, as I know that they are as much entitled to compensation as employees who have met with an accident. We have, however, to protect the public interest. In view of my experience during the war period, when medical certificates were " framed up " by family practitioners as a favour to the persons concerned, the Government should prescribe the medical practitioner who is to grant the certificate.

                    <para>. - If the compensation under this measure was payable in the circumstances which prevail in the States, I should be willing to amend the clause in the direction suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Honorable senators, however, should remember that a commissioner is to be appointed. When a similar measure was under discussion in this chamber on a previous occasion, it was pointed out that the intention was to allow the commissioner to settle such matters. In the first place a man must be employed in one of the processes mentioned in the schedule. If he is employed either immediately before or at the time of incapacity he must obtain a certificate from a duly qualified medical practitioner that the disease contracted is the disease or one of the diseases set out in the first column of the schedule. The doctor has only to certify that the employee is suffering from a particular disease, and to give a certificate accordingly. It then has to be proved that the employee has been working in one of the processes mentioned in the schedule. On proof of these two facts the law presumes, unless proof to the contrary is given, that he is entitled to compensation. It is quite consistent with the general system of compensation. I admit that an employee may have contracted, say, lead poisoning before entering the service; hut that may happen to an employee in any other service. If an employee working under a State act is engaged in any of the processes mentioned in the schedule and, produces a medical certificate that he is suffering from a disease, he is presumed to have contracted it while working for his previous employer. No attempt is made under this clause to saddle the Commonwealth with any liability other than that of an ordinary employer. The medical practitioner does not have to certify that the employee contracted the disease while in the employ of the Commonwealth; but that he is, or  is  not, suffering from the disease. The employee has to submit himself for examination, and the Commissioner is in a fortunate position, because there  is  no limitation on his discretion as to proof. An employee may not be suffering from plumbism but from neurasthenia. Any possible dangers are amply safeguarded by the fact that a departmental officer has to decide whether proof to the contrary has been furnished. If the medical practitioner should certify that the employee is not suffering from plumbism that would probably be the end of the case; hut if, on the other hand, he should certify that he is suffering from that complaint, the department has to take only the same risk as an ordinary employer. An employer engages an employee with all his defects ; but in the case of occupational diseases, the Commonwealth is not liable unless it employs the man in one of the processes mentioned in the second schedule. </para>

                    GLASGOW (Queensland) [1.25 a.m.]. - I, too, had some experience in connexion with claims made on governmental departments by employees alleged to be suffering from certain disases. In one case, the man received a certificate from a medical practitioner and, although all the evidence was against him, he persisted in pressing his claim against the department. If general medical practitioners are permitted to give medical certificates serious trouble will result in the department through the multiplicity of claims which will be lodged. The Minister would be well advised to tighten up this provision by providing that a certificate shall be obtained from a referee, as is mentioned in clause 18.

                    <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition suggests that the qualified medical practitioner should not, for the purposes of this act, be the family doctor. That point has, I think, been answered by the Minister. If the medical practitioner gives an incorrect certificate, the Commissioner has every facility under the provision relating to a referee to deal with the matter. The second point raised by the Leader of the Opposition was to the effect that once a certificate is given proof is established against the Crown which is very difficult to disprove. When a similar measure was under consideration some time ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Qreene</inline> said that meat inspectors, for instance, were liable to contract anthrax, and on their entering the Commonwealth service the Government might be saddled with the responsibility which should be borne by the previous employer. It seems that the difficulty lies in the degree of proof. At first it appeared to me that the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition was covered by the provision relating to the appointment of the medical referee; but even if a medical referee is appointed, a certificate must be obtained showing that the employee is suffering from a particular disease. Then the law comes to his aid in sub-clause 5, which provides that the disease shall be deemed, to have been caused by the employment in which he was engaged. That places on the Crown a burden which it cannot discharge. The sub-clause saddles the Crown with the liability and allows the man's previous employer to escape. I admit that that difficulty would arise only in the case of men who had been for a short time in the employ of the Government. The position might be met by some modification of the language of this clause. The Minister is familiar with this class of legislation, and may be able to suggesi a suitable amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - We appear to be agreed that there are sufficient means of determining whether an employee has contracted a disease. The difficulty is to determine whether he contracted it while employed by the Government, or when working for another employer. The extreme case cited by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> - that of an employee who might have started work the day before he made his claim - could not apply to most diseases. For instance, a man could not contract lead poisoning in one day. Even though it was proved that he was suffering from lead poisoning, it would be known that he had contracted it before he entered the employment of the Government. </para>

                <para>SenatorRAE. - If the day on which he took ill followed closely on the day of his commencing work for the Government, it would be obvious that he contracted the disease before he became an employee of the Government. The provision is not so dangerous as some honorable senators would have us believe. Even if an easy-going family doctor who desired to please a patient gave a certificate, the Commissioner could submit the case to the medical referee. There would be no difficulty about determining whether or not he was suffering from a particular disease; the difficulty would be to decide when he contracted it. That is a matter which it is almost impossible to determine definitely, unless the man has been so recently engaged that he could not possibly have contracted tlx1 disease at his present place of employment. </para>

                        <para>- All that the certifying medical practitioner can do is to certify that, in his opinion, the disease was not due to the nature of the employment. That is proof of the contention that in the absence of proof to the contrary the disease shall be deemed to have been due to the nature of the employment in which the employee was engaged. The only difference between the two provisions is the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition that in one case the certificate is that of a duly qualified medical practioner, and in the other case of a certifying medical practioner. In the one case, the medical practitioner is expected to establish a negative proof, whereas in the other case an affirmative proposition must be established. But in either ease the result is the same from the point of view of the employer. The legislation in force in South Australia provides for a certifying medical practioner. Once he issues a certificate that a man is suffering from one of the diseases mentioned in the schedule, and it is established that he was engaged in the process set opposite to that disease in the schedule, the man is deemed to have contracted the disease while in the service of the last man by whom he was employed in that process. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. This particular certificate is only proof in the absence of proof to the contrary. It does not say that, until the Commissioner is satisfied, he shall be deemed to be suffering from a particular disease. The legislature has definitely allowed a discretion to the Commissioner as to what should amount to proof in the absence of proof to the contrary. In principle there is no difference between this clause, and the provisions of Workmens' Compensations Acts in operation generally in England and Australia. "There is no need for further tightening of the clause if the intention of the Senate is merely to limit the liability of the Government to that of private employers. </para>

There are certain determinations already in existence, and they should be allowed to run their course. The employee cannot have it both under the determination and under the act. I think that in the case of any future determinations, the arbitrator would ask himself "Is this matter in dispute?" as he is to deal only with matters in dispute between a department and employees. He would probably conclude" We must have uniformity in the service. That has been effected by the new measure. I shall make no determination". </para>

                </quote>
                <para>I feel sure that this bill will commend itself to honorable senators. It is an attempt to overcome a serious difficulty which has arisen in Tasmania in connexion with the marketing of hops. To convey to honorable senators some idea of the magnitude of the problem, I propose to quote briefly from statistical data which will be of some assistance in the consideration of this measure. The average quantity of hops used annually by brewers, bakers, and others in Australia during the last ten years was 10,548 bales, each bale weighing 240 lb. The estimates of the Tasmanian and Victorian crops for the 1929-30 season just closed were 8,750 bales and 1,580 bales respectively, or a total of 10,330 bales. The area under cultivation is approximately 1,200 acres in Tasmania and 300 acres in Victoria. </para>
                <para class="block">The quantity of hops exported during 1928-29 was 2,083 bales. Of this quantity, 73 per cent, was shipped to the United Kingdom, and 26 per cent, to the Irish Free State.  During  the last two years, the Tasmanian Hopgrowers Limited has sold 3,000 bales of hops to Messrs. Guinness of Dublin, but its offer this year of 2,000 bales at the low price of 6d. per lb. was refused by Guinness without any reason being assigned. From inquiries made by the High Commissioner's Office, London, it appears that the refusal was due to an abundant surplus of hops in the home market caused by an over-production in England and on the Continent with consequent, low prices, Belgian hops being quoted at <inline font-style="italic">ll/d.</inline> per !b., and Polish at 1-id. per lb. f.o.b. Antwerp. English low and medium grade hops were quoted at from 2 l-7d. to 2-id. per lb. Imports of hops to Australia during <inline font-style="italic">1928-29,</inline> amounted to 427 bales, and the average quantity imported annually during the last three years has been 640 bales. Of the total imported during 1928-29, approximately 85 per cent, came from New Zealand, 8 per cent, from the United States of America, and 6 per cent, from Czecho-Slovakia. </para>
                <para>Since March, 1922, an arrangement has existed between the hop-growers of Tasmania and the Australian brewers, whereby the latter have restricted their importations of hops to 15 per cent, of the annual consumption of each individual brewer. That arrangement is still in force. Following a meeting held in May last, certain Tasmanian hop-growers wrote to the Government asking that an embargo be placed on the importation into Australia of foreign hops and substitutes for hops, and also that the Commonwealth Parliament should enact legislation to regulate the interstate trade in hops. Following these representations, the Federal Government requested the  Hon.  J. Gunn, Director of Development, to proceed to Tasmania and inquire into the position of the hop industry there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> has presented his report which has been tabled in both Houses of Parliament. </para>
                <para>There are in Tasmania about 150 growers producing 8,750 bales of hops per annum, and in Victoria about 25 growers producing 1,600 bales. It is estimated that there will be in the Commonwealth a carry-over of 4,000 bales to next season. For some years prior, to the last crop 1929-30, the marketing of the major portion of the hops produced in Tasmania was carried out by a pool called " The Tasmanian Hop-growers Limited." but owing principally to the lack of support by the growers, the pool found itself" unable to continue beyond the season mentioned. Victorian .growers have not entered into any pooling arrangements, each grower disposing of his hops by private contract. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline>
                    report states that in anticipation of the termination of the pool, and of a difficult situation after 1930, H. Jones &amp; Company, and other buyers of Tasmanian hops, made contracts towards the end of 1929 to supply brewers with approximately 7,000 bales of hops per annum during the years 1931, 1932, and 1933. Having made these contracts, the buyers then negotiated with a certain number of selected growers whose hops, it is alleged, are acceptable to the brewers, and made contracts with them for the purchase of their hops during the three-year period mentioned. The exact quantity which these growers have contracted to supply is 6,910 bales per annum - 27 growers have made contracts. Both, the brewers' and the growers' contracts are for three years, with the right of renewal for a further period of two years. The price to be paid by the brewers for brewers' quality hops is 2s. per lb., and the price to be paid to growers is, in most cases, ls. 9d. per lb. These contracts cover practically the whole of the brewers' requirements in Tasmanian hops for the period in question. One other firm in Tasmania has also made contracts with growers, and with small mainland brewers, but these contracts would not cover more than approximately 500 bales of hops. The effect of these contracts is practically to exclude the majority of growers without contracts from participation in the Australian market for hops. In making their contracts in Tasmania, the brewers have not purchased their total Australian requirements, a margin apparently having been left to allow of purchase of hops produced in Victoria.
                </para>
                <para>The present position is that in Tasmania 27 growers have contracted to supply practically the whole of the Tasmanian hops required by brewers for the years 1931, 1932, and 1933, whilst in Victoria the hop-growers have made contracts for the disposal of their hops, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline> report, they are quite satisfied with existing arrangements. In Tasmania there are approximately 120 growers who have not been able to make contracts. These growers have requested the Federal Government to place an embargo on the importation of hops into Australia, and to introduce legislation to regulate interstate trade and commerce in hops. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline>
                    states that a number of small growers will not be able to produce a crop next year because of the low return received consequent upon the failure of the pool to dispose of a large portion of the 1930 crop, and their inability to obtain further credit. Notwithstanding the present tariff, hops can be imported at prices below what is profitable for the Australian grower. The large consumers having contracted to obtain their Tasmanian supplies from 27 growers through Messrs. H. Jones &amp; Company, and other buyers, it will be impossible for the great bulk of the remaining 120 growers either to obtain finance for the production of a crop or to market it when produced. This arbitrary method of reducing production is not equitable.
                </para>
                <para>It may be urged that any proposal involving a reduction in production should be left entirely to the State concerned. On this point I remind honorable senators that, as regards the rationing of the market for hops, a State law will be ineffective outside the State itself. Consequently, representations were made to the Commonwealth Government to introduce legislation on lines similar to the Dried Fruits Act. Naturally the Commonwealth Government would not take action without first consulting the States. I have had an interview with the Premier of Tasmania, who, fortunately, happened to be in Canberra attending a meeting of the Loan Council. This proposal was submitted to him, and I have his assurance that it offers the only solution for the present difficulty in that State. </para>

                        <para>- As they sell to the brewers in Victoria they are not affected by this legislation. This measure will affect only those growers who intend to sell their product outside the State in which it is grown. I understand that the Carlton Brewery, in Victoria, absorbs practically the whole of the Victorian production of hops, and, therefore, the licence referred to in the bill would not be applicable to Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> suggests two alternatives for the future control of the industry - </para>

                <para class="block">In regard to the first of those two alternatives, the opinion in Tasmania is that, if the industry is to be controlled at all, authority should be exercised by the Federal Government, as any attempt at control by the State would he ineffective. The Commonwealth Government, realizing the precarious position in which the hop-growers in Tasmania are placed, is yielding to their request by introducing  this legislation for their protection. This measure, if enacted, will control interstate and overseas trade in hops, and is to give effect to the Government's intention ::: that regard. </para>
                <para>The bill provides for the creation of an Australian hop board consisting of three representatives elected by hop-growers in Tasmania, one representative elected by hop-growers in the other States of the Commonwealth, and a Government representative appointed by the Governor-General. The reason it is proposed to allot three growers' representatives to Tasmania is on account of the large production of hops in that State, 8,750 bales having been produced last season, in comparison with 1,600 bales in Victoria, and a negligible production in South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian Hop Board will control the export and interstate trade in hops. This control will be exercised by the issue of licences to growers subject to such conditions and restrictions as are prescribed by regulation. </para>

                <para>The board will allot a share of the business with brewers and others requiring hops outside Tasmania to each grower, according to his production, provided, of course, that the grade and quality of the hops are up to the standard laid down by the board. This will mean that the Australian market for hops will be open to all growers. In other respects the measure is a replica of similar measures introduced in connexion with the canned and dried fruits industries. The Senate has to decide whether the Commonwealth Government should interfere' with the hop industry, and, if so, whether the method proposed is the most effective to ensure some form of stabilization. </para>

                        <para>- It would have been useless to take a ballot when there were no purchasers of the product handled by the pool. It is now a matter of whether 120 hop-growers shall be allowed to continue in the production of hops or be compelled to discourage production. I understand that the allotments on which the hops are grown are so small that they cannot profitably be utilized for any other purpose. In these circumstances, the Government considers it wise to intervene in their interest. As these proposals have received the approval of the Tasmanian Government, I trust the Senate will pass the bill. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia) [2.43 a.m.]. - The Minister
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline>
                    has said that this measure is similar to other bills passed in connexion with the control and export of canned and dried fruits. But to enable  the dried fruits export control and similar other measures to become operative, State, as well as Federal, legislation was necessary. The Minister has not informed the Senate if the Governments of Tasmania or of Victoria are willing to pass supplementary legislation. After reading
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline>
                    report I would be surprised to learn that those Governments will pass such legislation. If not, this measure, if enacted, will be ineffective. Export control boards have handled canned and dried fruit, and butter. In connexion with those products there was an excess of production over local consumption. As the hulk of the surplus production was exported there is an essential difference between those products and that under consideration. At present, I understand, there is no market overseas for Australian hops. Previously, the only overseas buyers were the manufacturers of Guinness's stout, but since the Commonwealth Governmentlias imposed additional customs duties upon imported bottle ale and stout, Guinness's have retaliated by saying that they will not take our hops.

                        <para>-It is not. The essential difference between i his product and others over which the Commonwealth Government is exercising control is that in this case there will be no excess production for export. Only about one-third of the dried fruit produced in Australia is consumed in this country; the remainder is disposed of overseas. The position is much the same in the case of canned fruits, butter, and pearl shell. Indeed, practically the whole of our pearl shell is exported. In this case, although the conditions are exactly the reverse, the same machinery is expected to deal with them. Other export control boards were appointed specifically to deal with our export trade. I have read carefully the case prepared by the growers who are asking for the regulation of the hop industry, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline> report on the hop industry. They are depressing documents. There is nothing in either of them to lead us to believe that the industry will benefit from the passing of this bill. At this late hour I shall not quote from those reports extensively; but the case put forward by that section of the hop growers which is asking for this legislation, shows a declining industry, and over production brought about by excessive prices. At one time during the war the price of hops rose to 8s. a lb. That high price led to excessive production. The industry is suffering to-day from that over production. How can we hope to compete in the markets of the world with a product which on the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn,</inline> is sold overseas at 2|d. a lb. as against a production cost of ls. 4d. in Australia? The story of hop-growing is a story of a declining industry. The Hop Industries Defence Committee seeks a remedy for the existing unsatisfactory state of affairs. It maintains that what is needed is a proper system of control. It says that the Commonwealth has protected the hop-growing industry by high tariffs, and that the Commonwealth is now bound to protect both the producer and the consumer. It goes on to say - </para>

                    PEARCE.I hope that the decrease is permanent. How can we maintain production when already there is overproduction, and at the same time maintain the price of an article which is already far above world parity? Yet we are asked to do those two impossible things in this bill. The people have such blind faith in an act of Parliament that they believe that almost anything can be done by legislation. They believe that by legislation we can make the economic sun stand still. It cannot he done. The kindest thing that we can do to these people is to tell them that it cannot be done. The unkind est thing would he to humbug them into believing that by passing this bill we can do the impossible. I have read the report and recommendations of

Jones and Company certainly have no love for the returned soldier hop-growers of Tasmania; on the contrary they are trying to force them out of existence. I do not suppose that many of these Tasmanian Jones represented Australia at the late war, although they cultivate jingoistic attitudes when asking the Government to protect their interests. I am not concerned about conserving the interests of Jones and Company, who have made millions of pounds out of sweated nigger labour in the Malaya tin fields. I dp not take advantage of my parliamentary privileges to make that statement. I am prepared to repeat it on the hustings.

                    <para>.- The trouble with the hop industry for some years past has been that there are too many hops grown. If there were no surplus there would be no trouble. The hop-growers have been able to avoid trouble until the present by exporting; but, as has already been explained, the fact that the hops grown in European countries can now be bought at as low a price as- 2d. or 3d. a lb., excludes any possibility of Australia exporting hops. That leaves only the Australian market available. The industry is not a big one as industries go in Australia ; but it means a tremendous lot to those engaged in it in Tasmania. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">At all times of the year it employs a great deal of labour, and especially does it do so at picking time. Anything we can do for it in a sensible way should he done; but no solution will be found unless provision is made for growing a smaller quantity of hops. Any scheme to help the hop industry must provide for a compulsory cessation of any extension of planting. I hold no brief for big or little growers. All should have a chance to make a living. No other industry in Australia lends itself so much to co-operation and voluntary control as does the hop industry. The total area under hops is not more than 1,200 acres, and it should be an easy matter to arrive at a scheme whereby every one can be satisfied. At present no one is satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> has read one telegram; I could have read 50. I have received from 20 to 30 from each side - one lot frantically telling me to support the bill, and the other lot assuring me that it would mean ruination to the industry if the bill were passed. I have, as I say, no brief for either side. All I want is that something shall he done to help the industry. I am convinced that, this bill will not do it. All that it will do is to provide for the granting of a licence to export hops from one State to another. If that is done fairly, the hops will be exported <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> according to the number of bales produced. But that in itself pre-supposes that some hops will not be exported. If there were no surplus there would be no need for the bill. If this bill is passed there will be such an increase in the surplus that in a year or two the cool stores in Tasmania will not hold it, and the scheme will break down with its own weight. This has been our experience with other pools. Those in control of the canned fruit pool adopted some weird scheme by which they tried to make people buy what they did not want. If they asked for peaches they had to take apricots or plums. As a result the people turned to America, which was prepared to supply them with what they required. The compulsory pool was supposed to be aimed at monopolies in Australia, but invariably its only effect was to lose the trade to Australia and allow monopolies in America to secure the market. They  are bound to fail because they interfere with the ordinary course of business. It has been said that the proposed pool will not interfere with the hop-growers in Victoria. Of course it will not. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it will, as I understand the growers in Victoria can dispose of the whole of their product to Victorian breweries; but it may interfere with the growers of that State if they attempt to export hops to New South Wales. The proposal certainly will interfere with Tasmanian growers, and actually it will be an open invitation to growers in Victoria to increase their acreage. Growers will chafe under the restrictions and will turn their attention to Victoria, where they will be free of restrictions. This will ruin the Tasmanian industry. In Victoria there is a great deal of land that is suitable for the growing of hops, and strangely enough Victorian growers usually obtain higher prices 'than are paid to Tasmanian producers, although I do not think the Victorian product is superior in quality. Some objection appears to be taken to the action of certain Tasmanian growers in making contracts for the disposal of .their hops for the ensuing three years. Does not every producer wish to make contracts for the sale of his crop? It seems to me to be a sensible way of conducting business operations. Only this week I received information that fourteen additional growers in Tasmania had made contracts to supply hops to consumers in Victoria. There is really nothing wrong about making a contract, but there is something fundamentally wrong about the action of a government which seeks to break contracts. A contract, honestly made, should be regarded as sacred. I hope that I 3hall never be a member of a parliament that passes legislation to annul contracts honestly made for the protection of producers and buyers. I believe that the industry can be stabilized if a certain proportion of the growers can be induced to cease production for a time. My information is that they are prepared to take this action voluntarily if they receive adequate compensation. After all the quantity of hops involved is not very great. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline> report, the carry-over is only about 4,000 bales. I feel certain that, if a workable scheme is evolved, a number of the growers will voluntarily cease production for the time being, so as to stabilize the industry. I do not know whether the figures which I have are correct, but for the purpose of my argument they are near enough. 1 am informed that the production this year will be 10,000 bales, and the requirements of the Australian market 8,000 bales, leaving a surplus of 2,000 bales. To stabilize the industry it will be necessary to make a levy - I suggest a compulsory levy under either the Commonwealth or State law - of id. a lb. on brewers, agents and growers. This will return l£d. per lb. on the total production. Prom the fund so created, it will be possible to pay 6d. per lb. to those growers who undertake not to string their hops for two or three years. On a crop of six bales to the acre, which is rather under the average, this will provide compensation equal to £36 per acre to those growers who cease production. It has been suggested that the Government may contribute another 2d. per lb. to the stabilization fund. If it does, this additional amount will bring the compensation payment up to £48 per aero per annum, which is rather more than growers have received for their hops in recent years. Hops exported to Ireland have realized 8d. per lb. c.i.f. United Kingdom ports, so the compensation necessary to stabilize the industry will give to those growers who, for the time being, cease production, more than they have obtained in the open market in recent years. I have it on good authority that those interested in the scheme will submit to a levy without the necessity to pass legislation. This scheme should stabilize the industry until the market recovers. The bill contains no reference to the disposal of the existing surplus. This is an important omission. I am informed that at the present time there is in Australia 12,000 bales of hops and that the brewers could have carried on without this year's production. If the Government had directed its attention to the disposal of the surplus, by offering an advance of 5d. or 6d. per lb. for a term of years, something would have been done to stabilize the industry. </para>

                <para>The scheme which I have outlined will not mean the elimination of the small grower. I have as much practical sympathy for the small growers as I have fox the big men in the industry. A stabilization scheme which provided for the payment of fair compensation, would be acceptable to the big growers, some of whom would be glad to take advantage of it, and turn their attention to some other form of production. It will, I think, be necessary to prohibit by legislation or by agreement the planting of further areas. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The honorable senator's interjection clearly indicates his belief that, if action is taken in Tasmania to restrict production, a splendid opportunity will be presented to growers in Victoria to extend the industry in that State, and engage in what will be a profitable trade. I would prohibit any growers from planting further areas. It would be necessary, also, to place an embargo on the importation of hops from overseas, because importations have primarily been responsible for all the trouble in the industry. If the Government placed an embargo on importations; if it prohibited the planting of further areas, and if it brought in a measure to provide for compensation to be paid to growers who elected not to string their hops for two or three seasons, I should support it as it would make the industry prosperous, and those engaged in it contented. This bill will not achieve that purpose, so I must vote against it. </para>

Urge you to reject legislation. From press reports the pool and board suggested to be elected by growers, irrespective of acreage, is quite unfair. £75,000 invested in the industry, and employing 7.50 men as pickers, will be in the hands of a board elected by small growers. </para>

                        E. Elliott has just informed the Senate that he has received a communication from  Colonel Cohen,  who, I understand, is a  chairman  of directors of the Carlton and United Breweries Limited, to the effect that if this measure is enacted it will inflict a great deal of hardship on the Victorian hop-growers. I cannot understand why such a message should have been despatched when the same gentleman has informed others that the bill will not have any detrimental effect on the hop industry in that State.

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes said that they could not see how this bill will assist the hop-growing industry; but we have been informed that if some control is not exercised, 120 small growers will be compelled to cease producing hops. It would appear that an effort is being made by the big hop-growers to squeeze out the small producers, and then to increase prices to the detriment of the consumer. I am totally opposed to monopolies in any form. According to the opinions expressed by a number of growers, this measure should have the effect of stabilizing the industry and limiting production. I am informed that if the measure is passed, 120 families will be able to continue in the industry, which means that, apart from manual workers, no fewer than 700 persons will benefit. Apparently, it is the intention of Henry Jones and Company, of Hobart, to exercise a controlling interest in the industry. The ballot which was taken was conducted in a most unsatisfactory manner, because it was assumed that those who did not return their ballot papers were opposed to the pool. The present pool was due to expire on the 30th April of this year. A ballot-paper was issued and each grower was asked to vote for or against a continuance of the pool. An instruction with the ballot-paper stated that those who did not return their ballot-papers would be considered to have voted against a continuance of the nool. About 34 papers were returned on twenty of which an affirmative vote, and on fourteen a negative vote was recorded. The real result of the ballot, excluding those who did not return their papers, was that 20 voted "Yes" and 14 voted "No". It was then announced that taking it that those who failed to return their ballot papers were against the pool, there was a substantial majority against its continuance, that the pool was at an end, .and that each grower would have to look after himself in the future. That is a most unusual way to obtain an opinion of thu growers. No one had a right to say that the papers which were not returned could he regarded as votes for or against the proposal. Only votes received should have been counted. Before the vote was taken the directors expressed themselves in favour of a federal pool. Jones &amp; Company, the principal hop-growers and sellers, said they would not agree, and offered to the directors of the pool and a few others a contract for their own hops. The directors accepted the contract, thus acting contrary to the interests of the other growers who had elected them. They played safe ; but who will say they played cricket? When the facts became known there was great indignation among the other growers. Jones and Company gave contracts to 26 persons. The larger number of 126 were to be absolutely excluded, and driven from the industry. A public meeting was held, and the matter fully discussed. A defence committee was formed, and an appeal made to the Federal Government to protect 126 families and their dependants and workers from destruction and ruin by the combine. The Government sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> to report on the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline> investigation was necessarily hurried, but he got a fair grasp of the position. The main fact revealed by him is that 126 families will be driven out of this highly protected industry unless this Parliament comes to their assistance. A defence committee was set up, and a defence fund, to which the whole Derwent Valley district subscribed, was created Apparently these people were afraid of the combine. Otherwise what was the reason for their request for an investigation, and government assistance? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes stated that he would not support the bill, although he admitted that it contained some redeeming features. He probably referred to the licensing of men to export hops. There seems to be a good deal of uncertainty as to the effect of this measure if passed. Some growers believe that it would benefit them; others are opposed to the bill. It is a pity that all the growers did not take the trouble to record their votes, for then we should have known whether a majority of them favoured the Government's proposals or wanted something different. In the circumstances, we can- not do better than accept the opinion of the Premier of Tasmania. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> has told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> informed him that he was prepared to accept the bill. All honorable senators may not fully understand the position of the hop industry in Tasmania to-day. They should, therefore, be willing to be guided by the Premier of that State, who should know what is best for the industry. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes will reconsider his decision to vote against the bill. Even if it does not accomplish all that we desire, it can do no harm. Honorable senators should be prepared to give it a trial. I do not want to benefit a few hop-growers at the expense of the many. The object of the bill is to assist the small growers of hops. If honorable senators find later that the results are less favorable than the Government expects them to be, they will be able to claim that they followed the advice of the Premier of Tasmania. </para>

                <para class="block">As that clause throws a doubt on the constitutionality of the billy we are led to seek the reason for its insertion. The reason is found in clause 15, which contains a proposal to restrain trade between the States. Under section 92 of the Constitution that cannot be done. It might possibly be done if each State Parliament passed an act permitting it. At present, however, it is not constitutional to restrain trade as between the States, and therefore the bill would accomplish no good purpose if it were passed. I have as much sympathy with the small growers of hops in Tasmania as lias any other honorable senator. Tasmanian senators oppose this measure, not because we stand for any particular class of hop-grower, but because we do not want this Parliament to pass any measure which will lead the hop-growers  of  Tasmania into false hopes, and to expect great things where they are impossible. I say definitely that it would be a shameful thing for any Parliament to break down contracts that had been honorably entered into. If something were wrong with the contracts, or if there had been restraint of trade, the position would be different. But where a man who has been producing something enters into contracts to dispose of it, it would be wrong to interfere. I very much regret that some growers have experienced difficulty in disposing of their crop. The scheme suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J</inline> . B. Hayes  is  an admirable one. I shall oppose the second reading of the bill. </para>

                        <para>- What does the honorable senator mean? Does he attempt to dictate what I shall do in this chamber ? If he thinks so, he will very soon find himself mistaken. I resent his interjection. Reference has been made to the attitude of the Premier of Tasmania towards this bill. Yesterday, in company with a number of other Tasmanian members, I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> in a room in this building where we discussed the proposals contained in this bill.  I say  without hesitation  that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee</inline> gave  us  no indication whatever that <inline font-style="italic">ha</inline> was in  favour of  the  bill. His statement  was  that the Tasmanian Government  had no  intention of bringing  in  any legislation  to  deal with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- He said very little about the bill; certainly nothing  in  favour of  it.  During  the  debate  it has  been claimed that  a  very large number  of  people will be thrown out  of  their occupation  if  this bill does not become  law.  I know the hop industry fairly well.  I  say definitely that the growers who  are  producing at least two-thirds of the total output of hops in Australia are giving more employment than is the section which we are asked to protect by this MIL It might be gathered from the debate  that  there are no workers to be considered  in  connexion with the hop-growers who have entered into contracts. I point out that those growers employ at least  150  families throughout the year, in addition to a large number of casual workers during harvesting operations. We should not Jo them an injustice. I understand that there are many returned soldiers among the families employed by the growers who have entered into contracts. I make that statement in reply to one by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> claiming that we shall throw many returned soldiers out of employment if we reject the bill. </para>

                    J.  B. Hayes put the matter very clearly when he stated that the hop industry in Tasmania has for some time been in a very difficult position through over-production, that the demand for hops has been decreasing, while the production has increased considerably. It is essential that there should be a curtailment of the growth of hops in that State.
                </para>
                <para>This bill cannot appeal to any fair-minded man, because it provides that those who are producing two-thirds of the total quantity of hops grown in Tasmania are to have no voice whatever in the control of the marketing of their hops. The measure provides that the members of the board that it is proposed to set up shall be elected by the growers, each grower who has two acres and over under hops to have a vote. There are 44 or more growers who have been able to make contracts, and 120 who have not been able to make contracts. Does it not follow that the 44, who are producing more than two-thirds of the total output, will have no voice in the election of the board that is to control the industry in the future? I have never heard of a more unfair suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I remember an occasion when there was a magnificent crop of plume in Tasmania, and no market for them. That firm paid every plum-producer in the island State a price per bushel for his plums on an estimated crop calculated by an official appointed by the firm, which did not take delivery of one plum. It did that in order to help those people tide over the had season. I should be less than a man if I did not resent imputations cast on the memory of Henry Jones, a name that is respected throughout Tasmania. There is always antagonism towards any man who does well out of industry, particularly in Australia.

                        - The approximate production per annum of these growers is 2,000 to 2,500 bales, and the amount required to finance the growing and harvesting of this quantity would involve an expenditure of, roughly, £25,000 to £30,000 per annum. Owing to the inferior quality of hops produced by the majority of these growers, it costs considerably more to market their product than is realized in the sale of them. Ninety per cent. of the hops grown by the growers referred to would not be acceptable to the Australian brewers, and, therefore, would (and have been in previous years) be shipped overseas, if it be possible to effect a sale, at about6d. per lb. f.o.b. Hobart, which would result in a loss to the growers, or the company financing, of half the cost of production.

                <para class="block">That offer would partially overcome the existing difficulty. If it were supplemented hy a scheme based on that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, I feel that the position could be met, and that, eventually, the small growers, some of whom will have to go out of production in the near future, would be much better off than they would be under the protection that would be afforded by this bill. This bill would not give them protection. The whole thing would break down with its own weight eventually, and for that reason I cannot see my way to support the second reading of the bill. If a measure came before us which I felt would meet the case and there was nothing in it to inflict an injustice on a portion of the people engaged in the hop industry, I should be found supporting it, but I am not going to be a party to breaking a contract or a party to preventing the possible realization of the ideal in regard to this industry as I understand it, namely, that its future depends entirely on the quality of the article produced, together with a limitation of the output to the bare needs of the consumers in Australia. For the reasons I have mentioned I oppose the second reading. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [4.32 a.m.]. - I have taken advantage of the presence in Canberra of the Premier of Tasmania, and an Honorary Minister of the Tasmanian Government, to invite their opinions on this measure, and they have both given me clearly and definitely to understand that they do not appreciate the interference of the Commonwealth Government in this matter. I am greatly enamored of the suggestion thrown out by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline>
                    B. Hayes that a bonus of 8d.  a  lb. should be given to every hop-grower for all the hops he does not grow, and I suggest in all seriousness that the idea be carried to its logical conclusion - that we remove entirely the present duty on hops and import our hops paying for them about1d. or 2d. a lb. in the countries in which they are grown, and that out of the money .  we save in that way we pay 8d. a lb. to all the present growers of hops in Australia indefinitely on condition that they permanently refrain from any further growing of hops. We should be considerably better off by doing so and should get cheaper beer. I challenge any honorable senator to find a flaw in that argument. I also contend very seriously that there are a number of industries in Australia which we bolster up under equally unsound, uneconomic conditions, and that it is largely because of that we are rapidly drifting into national bankruptcy. I oppose the second reading of this bill.
                </para>
                <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [4.34 a.m.]. - It appears that the hop industry is in a very queer condition. We Are told that the law of supply and demand rules these matters, but it is apparently working backwards in this case, because more hops are being produced than there is demand for, and hops that could be obtained from overseas are so very cheap in comparison with the cost of production in Tasmania that the whole industry is in a more or less hazardous position. There are, I understand, 44 growers whose interests are diametrically opposed to those of 26 others; so that although the industry is confined to a small corner of the Commonwealth there are so many engaged in growing hops that they form two diverse factions and one section, in order to save itself, is willing to send the other to perdition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> Bays that it would pay us to allow hops to be imported free of duty and subsidize the Tasmanian hop growers on condition that they cease growing hops. Obviously the honorable senator fully realises the anomaly of the present situation, but at the same time he does not see that the capitalistic system of which he is an upholder is founded on equally contradictory and idiotic methods. It is only as that system progresses to the fulfilment of its destiny that we find it is condemned to destruction by reason of its inherent contradictions. Time after time we see sermons in the press, and politicians and publicists tell us that the economic salvation of this country depends on more production; but as soon as we start producing anything, we get orders that we must destroy some of our crops or cease to produce so much in order that a market may be found for a smaller quantity than is capable of being produced. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Your policy is the same in regard to butter. We send our best butter to England and sell it there at a price which is less than that which we pay for the second grade quality we consume ourselves. That policy is not singular to Australia.. It is followed more or less all over the world. It is due to the fact that instead of producing for use as sane beings would do we are idiotic enough to try always to secure a profit whether the article we produce is good or not, and, unless we can sell it for more than it is worth, we are plunged into poverty. There waa a time when the human race suffered actual shortage of necessities of life because people in these days were not sufficiently advanced in the use of irrigation and other methods of fighting the powers of nature. Now we find that the more we produce the poorer we are. When our marts and stores are glutted with an abundance of the good things of life every second man is thrown out of employment and cannot find means of livelihood.  We  perish in the midst of plenty. I invite honorable senators to consider the fundamental causes of these things. If they do so they will find that the whole system we are trying to bolster with this palliative legislation is doomed to destruction because it is inherently self-contradictory :md destructive of all the best elements of human kind. </para>

                    <para>. - A most extraordinary set of circumstances has developed during the time this bill has been before the Senate. Honorable senators were first of all assured that certain interests most whole-heartedly supported the measure, but a few days afterwards similar assurances from other quarters indicated an entirely opposite view. My main reason for rising at this late hour of the morning to offer a few observations on the bill is the hope that some of those who have changed their minds during the last few hours, may again change them. We have listened to most extraordinary arguments, more particularly from some honorable senators representing the State which is most vitally interested in the bill. We are told by one that this proposal is an unnatural interference with trade. I venture to suggest that the proposed action of the Government is that of the policeman who steps in to protect a weak section of the community from the oppressive action of a strong section. The action of the strong section of the community in squeezing out an industry which exists under the tariff wall built by this Commonwealth seems to me to be something in the nature of restraint of trade. I remind honorable senators that there may come a time when the majority of this Parliament may reconsider the giving of protection to the hop industry if those who happen to have the power today use it to smash the weaker but more numerous section of the industry. I do not say that I advocate that course. I think that the saner course is for the Commonwealth Parliament, which has already protected the industry, to see that the benefits are reasonably distributed among all who are entitled to participate therein. The result of the defeat of this bill will be that growers who have been growing hops, some of them for 40 years, others on holdings selected by their forefathers a century ago, will be forced off the land, and thrown into an already overstocked labour market to work as -employees for those who will benefit by the arrangement which will be consummated if this legislation is not passed. So much for the alleged unnatural regulation of the industry. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We are told that the principal difficulty as regards the marketing of hops, is the huge surplus which hangs like a dark cloud over the industry. I have searched the various documents that have been submitted in connexion with this proposal, and I have not discovered any evidence of a serious surplus. I do not blame Jones &amp; Co. for the arrangement which they have made with a limited number of Tasmanian growers. I have never taken up an attitude of hostility to any big combine merely because it is a combine. If the people of Australia are foolish enough to approve of a Constitution under which big business organizations can obtain a strangle-hold on industry, they deserve to suffer. The remedy lies in an alteration of the Constitution to permit this Parliament to legislate against that condition of affairs. The Hop Growers Defence Association contends that the surplus is not nearly so serious as honorable senators would have us believe, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn's</inline> report seems to endorse the views of that body.. In a review of the hop-growing industry from 1921-22 to 1929-30 he states that the average annual production is 9,726 bales and the average annual consumption 10,548 bales. That does not look like a. serious over-production. - I understand also that it is possible to grow in Tasmania a type of hops which will render it unnecessary to import hops. That statement has not been denied. It is not fair to. base any argument of over-production on figures relating to production and consumption for one year only. The only safe course is to consider these figures over a certain period and the longer the period the more accurate is the estimate likely to be. A period of ten years is, I suggest, sufficiently long to arrive at  a  correct estimate of the position. During the period mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn,</inline> the acreage under crop ranged from 1,400 to  1,500 acres. This does not bear out the contention of those who oppose the bill that the Australian market cannot absorb the present production. </para>

Failing action by this Parliament, the alternative is for the Tasmanian Government to restrict planting and arrange for the disposal of the production of that State. But legislation passed by the Tasmanian Parliament will be ineffective because the consumption of hops in Tasmania is infinitesimal compared with the demands of the market in the mainland States. Because of its power to control interstate trade, the Commonwealth Parliament is the only legislative authority which can regulate the industry. It has been urged by opponents of the bill that the small growers are inefficient. These people have been producing hops for the last 40 or 50 years. It was not until the Government had announced its intention to introduce this bill that critics of the scheme discovered that the small hop-growers of Tasmania were inefficient. It is indeed remarkable that it is only at this late hour that we hear complaints of inefficiency as regards the 120 growers who are to be squeezed out of the business by the arrangement made between H. Jones and Company and the 26 selected growers. </para>

                        <para>- It will help them by compelling all those engaged in the industry to take their fair share of the market which is available on the mainland. This Parliament passed legislation on similar lines with regard to the producers of dried fruits. No contract made between certain hop-growers and H. Jones and Company need be prejudicially affected. There is ample provision in the bill to guarantee those who made the contracts as to quality and quantity, if the business is properly regulated. I trust that despite the opposition of Tasmanian representatives in this chamber the Senate will pass the bill, so that arrangements may be made to assist the hops industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes propounded a scheme for the repatriation of surplus growers of hops. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> immediately pointed out that a much more effective proposal would be to remove the import duty upon hops, to allow the Belgian product to be imported at1½d. or 2d. a lb., close down the industry in Tasmania, and pay the growers8d. per lb. on the understanding that they ceased production. He went on to point out that if this policy were adopted the people of Australia would be in pocket over the transaction. But I do not favour that proposal. I believe that the period of low prices in the continental market for hops will soon pass. Even in cheap labour countries I cannot visualize the possibility of continued production at present price levels. I believe, therefore, that the Australian industry should be regulated and encouraged. I hope that the second reading will be passed. When the bill is in committee we shall be able to consider carefully any amendments that may be suggested. </para>

                <para class="block">I fail to see how this measure can prevent over-production, which has been the trouble for a number of years, or stabilize the industry. Some years ago, a deputation of hop-growers which waited upon the Treasurer in Melbourne, asked for a substantial advance on surplus production which was then being exported at a loss. Those supporting the bill have stressed the fact that a number of small hop-growers will be unable to continue in the industry if this measure is not passed. While I and other honorable senators representing Tasmania are particularly anxious to assist such growers, we cannot overlook the fact that our responsibility is to assist all sections of the community and in this instance to record a vote for the benefit of the whole industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> shows clearly in his deport that the demand for hops is diminishing instead of increasing. Even the brewers and the bakers are not using as large a quantity as they did years ago. From whatever angle we study this subject, we cannot overlook the fact that this industry is not likely to expand, and that in common with other primary industries it cannot without substantial financial assistance profitably market its product overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> further states that hops can be purchased in other countries at prices from 50 per cent. to 90 per cent. lower than those now ruling in the Commonwealth. This measure does not provide a solution of the difficulty, and if it is enacted it will be even more difficult to help the hop-growers in the future. </para>

                <para>I  am not aware what attitude my colleagues  from  Tasmania  are  adopting towards the proposed " Hop Control ".  I  have seen a copy of  the  bill and  I  am not enthusiatic about it, and since carefully thinking  the  matter over,  I  fail to  see  how  the  proposal will help the small  grower in any  way,  as the real  problem  la that  hops is not an exportable product beyond our  own  market, and our production exceeds local demand. The market, therefore, for hops, unlike that of other primary products cannot  be  improved  or widened  by  any form  of control, and the inevitable solution is a reduction of area and quantity.  I  think this is a more fitting problem for the State than for the Federal Government. Some growers have undoubtedly to go out or reduce production, and the most efficient must survive or the whole industry will be threatened. </para>

We have also other reports from as far back as the time when the Board of Trade investigated the subject. Honorable senators supporting this measure appear to overlook the crux of the whole matter. It is that there is overproduction and hops cannot be profitably exported. In some cases it is difficult to obtain the cost of production. There is no overseas market, and unfortunataely the local demand is limited. The brewers are the masters of the situation. It is easy to provide Government control ; but when we get down to bedrock it is the actual brewers - not the brewing companies - who will say what hops they will purchase and the price they will pay. In his report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn</inline> stated - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It has been laid down by certain brewers that it is necessary to import foreign hops for blending purposes in order to manufacture a mild beer. </para>
                    <para>The managing director of one of the largest breweries in Australia has stated that his company has not imported any hops for the past three years, with the exception of four bales imported for comparative purposes. He aid that the exclusive use of Australian hops has only been made possible by his brewers exercising the greatest care in selection and in blending, and also by providing expensive cold storage for hops purchased. </para>
                    <para>The arrangements whereby the brewers agree to limit their imports to 15 per cent, of their annual requirements is purely a voluntary one, and is renewed from year to year. With the present low prices for overseas hops there is always a possibility that the brewers might refuse to renew the agreement, thus  leaving  themselves free to import any quantity they de lire. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is the crux of the matter. It might be necessary, later, to give effect to the postscript to the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> that an embargo be imposed on imports. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> spoke of the ruthless and cruel strangling of a poor legislative child just born. The bill, which I saw for the first time yesterday, appears to have been ill-conceived and hastily prepared. I- cannot see how by passing this legislation we can assist the hop growing industry. On the contrary, a careful examination of the bill forces me to the conclusion that it is more likely to destroy the industry than to help it. The election of a board to control the industry is to be conducted on the basis of one grower, one vote. That may be democratic, but it is unsound. Why should the grower of ten bales have the same voting power as a grower of 500 bales. It might even result in a person with no knowledge of the marketing of hops being placed on the board. I have received numbers of telegrams supporting the Government's proposal, and just 'as many condemning it. The only thing that can be said for those telegrams is that they will assist the revenue of the Postmaster-General's Department. In dealing with this measure we have to consider its possible effect whether it is likely to benefit or to injure the industry. This bill is another pathetic attempt to do impossible things by legislation. I must confess to my disappointment with the measure ; I frankly admit that I expected something better - something that would really help the industry and not hamstring it as this bill would do. As there is already an over production of hops in Australia the industry must be so controlled that only sufficient hops will be grown to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. It is obvious that we cannot export hops a* a profit, at world's parity. </para>
                <para class="block">A good deal has been said about the returned soldier hop-growers in the Derwent Valley. An appeal was made to the Senate to save them from ruin. As a returned soldier I get very tired of the way in which the returned soldier is used, in season and out of season, as a stalking horse to aid some project or other. What about the returned soldier who has entered into contracts and employs other returned soldiers and their families? What of the 44 growers who have entered into contracts, and provide employment for about 130 families, many of whom are returned soldiers? One group of 35 contractors produces about 7,000 bales of hops from 900 acres. Then we have 100 growers who produce 2,000 bales, of hops from 250 acres. When an appeal is made on behalf of the returned soldiers in an industry, I immediately want to investigate it to ascertain whether it is genuine, because I am a returned soldier myself. I am weary of the way that returned soldiers are dragged into various matters, as though they were persons apart from the rest of the community. When we soldiers discarded khaki, we became ordinary citizens of the Commonwealth and desired to be treated as such. Having carefully considered what action I should take in connexion with this bill, I cannot see that any good can result from it, and therefore I shall not vote for it. The board to be set up might, by incapable management through inexpert knowledge, do the industry a great deal of harm so that its last state would be worse than the first. In the past, so much trouble has been caused by governmental control of industry, that I have no faith that this board could do its job effectively. For the reasons that I have given I am not prepared to support the bill. Whatever appeal the bill may make to my heart, it does not appeal to my head. If I thought that it would assist the industry, and particularly the smaller growers, I would support it, but as I feel that to pass it would be to cause chaos, waste and muddle in the hop-growing industry, I cannot support it. </para>

                        <para>- Believing that the bill was in the interests of Tasmania, the Government expected to receive support for it from Tasmanian senators. For the purpose of this bill I am simply representing the Minister for Markets and Migration. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> said, it is a compliment to this chamber that the bill was introduced here first. I am convinced that the Minister for Markets and Migration honestly believed that the appeal made by the hop-growers met with the approval of the public men of Tasmania. I am not in the habit of repeating conversations, but, in the course of an interview with the Premier of Tasmania within the precincts of this House - an interview which I did not seek - he asked me when the bill was coming on. When I asked him what was his opinion on the matter he said that it appeared to him to be the best thing the Government could do in the circumstances. In answer to his question I informed him that I did not think the bill would come on that day. He said that he was meeting the Tasmanian senators, and I naturally assumed from his remarks that he was in favour of the bill. He said nothing to indicate that he was opposed to it. Had he given me any idea to that effect, I would certainly have gone to the Prime Minister and pointed out to him the absolute futility of introducing into the Senate a bill of this description against the wishes of the Premier of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- That is another instance of the contradictory information which has been furnished to honorable senators. Despite the fact that there appears to he a good deal of confusion, I still believe that the bill would be a very good thing for the hop growers of Tasmania. The Government is not pledged to the actual wording of the bill. I suggest that honorable senators should allow the bill to go into committee, so that it may be reshaped in a manner which will be suitable to Tasmanian representatives. If that is done we may be able to frame a measure which will meet with the approval of the majority in another place. I feel certain that if once the bill gets into committee we shall be able to amend it in such a way as to satisfy the Tasmanian growers, and even make it acceptable to Jones &amp; Co., whose name has been frequently mentioned in the course of this debate. However, if honorable senators from Tasmania feel that there is no merit in the bill, I cannot blame other honorable senators for not desiring to force it on Tasmania. </para>

The honorable senator is correct; but the gentleman in question had my full permission  to  occupy the place. While I  do  not wish  to  make any <inline font-style="italic">tu</inline><inline font-style="italic">quoque</inline> remarks I  may  call attention  to  the fact that when the Wheat Marketing Bill, which is no longer on the business-paper, was before the Senate, we saw occupying a seat in the enclosure for officials on the Government side of the House a gentleman who I have since learned was not  a  public official. At all events, public officials or not, it lies within my province to give permission to any one who I think may be useful and aidful to the respective leaders on either side of the chamber to occupy the seats on the floor of the chamber reserved for officials. </para>
