                            <para>From inquiries made, it appears that there is no standard wholesale or retail price for cartridges in Western Australia, each vendor fixing his own price. The prices of the 'Australian Loaded Eley Grand Prix 12- gauge shotgun cartridge prior  to  3rd April, 1 930,were- Wholesale (in lots of 7,000 ), 16s. or l7s. per 100; wholesale (in lots of 1,000), 18s. to 20s. per 100; retail, 18s. 6d. to24s.  per  . 100.

Thisincrease is said to have had no connexion whatever with the increased customs duty, and was decided upon prior to the date the customs duty was increased. It is attributed to adverse exchange in connexion with the imported components. </para>

That statement clearly explained the position regarding the satisfactory progress of recruiting, and indicated that although recruiting for the month of June might reach the same standard as for previous months, the total strength reached would be offset by the numbers it was anticipated would be discharged.

                    PEARCE (Western Australia) [3.16].  -  I do not propose to discuss this bill at length, as in the circumstances, I amin agreement with what the Government propose. There is, however, a matter relating to the conditions of employment of private secretaries to Ministers and Leaders of the Opposition which I wish to bring under the notice of the Leader of the Government in the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline>
                    and I ask that he will be good enough to give it consideration. The Government has, I think, very rightly made some provision to meet the case of public servants seconded for duty as private secretaries to Ministers' or to Leaders of the  Opposition;  but one point appears to have been overlooked, If an officer selected as a private secretary had remained in a department he would in the normal course of events, have been entitled to increments based upon length of service ; but when seconded as a private secretary to a Minister or to a Leader of the Opposition he receives only an allowance in accordance with the Public Service regulations. If he conducts his work as a private secretary with satisfaction he, of course, holds his position for some time ; but if his services are considered unsatisfactory he is quickly returned to the Public Service. Officers showing adaptability and ability are retained by Ministers, and consequently lose the opportunity to obtain thetherements or promotion they would have received had they remained in a department. A time comes when, in view of the years of service, the salary becomes inadequate - there is a limit to the salary to be paid to private secretaries - and they then have to return to a department.
                </para>
                <para class="block">Provision is made in the bill that the Public Service Board may appoint such officers to positions at salaries approximating those which they received as private secretaries. That is not mandatory upon the board, because a suitable position may not be available. Such an officer may have to wait some time before being appointed to a position in the Public Service at a salary approximating that which he received as a private secretary. I understand that in these circumstances he returns to the Public Service at the salary which he was receiving prior to being seconded for duty as a private secretary; but he does not receive the increments which he would have obtained had he remained in the service. I should like the Leader of the Government to inform the Senate if that position has been met in this bill. It seems to me that it is not. As an act of justice, the difficulty should be overcome, perhaps by an amendment of the Public Service regulations. These young officers - they are usually young - who take these positions should not suffer because they possess ability. If they do not, they are quickly returned to the Public Service. If they possess ability they should not suffer in consequence. </para>

                        <para>. - The point raised by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> agitated the mind of the Government considerably when this bill was being drafted. The difficulties surrounding legislation affecting the Public Service are, however, so great that it could not see how the contingency referred to by the right honorable gentleman could be met. The point is not the period for which a particular man may be engaged on certain work, but the nature of the work on which he is engaged. A man who, in his proper avocation, would earn a salary of £2,000 a year might be employed on work which merits a payment of only £500 a year. Difficulty arises when a man in, say, the Postmaster-General's Department, whose salary and increments are fixed in relation to his work in that department, is transferred to another position in which the sense of responsibility is entirely different. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">There must be a certain discretionary power in respect to private secretaries who are transferred back to their original departments, otherwise the whole scheme will be upset. That difficulty arose when certain officers were transferred from the Development and Migration Commission to the Public Service again. In its endeavour to treat those men justly, the Public Service Board had also to see that no injustice was done to other officers of the Public Service. In so far as it affects private secretaries who are returned to the Public Service, this particular' provision is on all fours with another provision relating to public servants who may be seconded for any other work. The clause is in conformity with the general scheme which operates throughout the Public Service. While the Government would like to alter the position in order to better the conditions of these private secretaries, the terms of the Public Service Act render that impossible. The clause is the best that the Government can do to mete out justice to all the men concerned. </para>

                        <para>. -  It appears that the  consideration  of the board is limited by the language employed. The board is to have regard to the office held by the officer prior to his being seconded for special duty. To that extent the proposed new  section  is satisfactory. The only other thing to which the board must give consideration is the period of the officer's employment as a private secretary. The duties pertaining to the office of a private secretary may be far more difficult  and  onerous than those which the officer discharged previously. I suggest that the position would be improved by the addition of the words " and nature " after the word " period ". That would enable the board to deal with his case in a more generous way than at present. I feel that the special nature of the duties of a private secretary should be taken into account. </para>

The honorable senator will recollect that this legislation was in contemplation during the regime  of  the previous Government, and  I am aware  that some of the officers then acting  as  private secretaries had reason  to believe  that the amendment would date  back to  the 1st July, 1929. I do not think that that would impose any additional expenditure upon the Government, and, out of a sense of justice to those officers, I ask the Minister to accept an amendment dating the provision back to the 1st July, 1929. </para>

                        <para>. - It is rather difficult to consider an amendment until one appreciates what its effect will be. This legislation was fully considered by the Public Service Board, and I know of no protests that have been lodged by anybody who claims to be entitled to be brought under the provisions of the measure. Unless the honorable senator can advise me of any case of hardship that is likely to occur from the retention of the date at present incorporated in the bill, I ask him not to press his suggested amendment. I could not accept an amendment simply to cover problematical cases. The committee is entitled to know what will be the effect of any legislation that is placed before it. </para>

Those officers were all seconded from their ordinary positions prior to the 1st January, 1930. Of course, when they accepted those positions, they took the risk with their eyes open. </para>

                    <para>.- To-day, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, a question in regard to the position of importers in Northern Tasmania who, through the imposition of primage duties of 2^ per cent., have had to pay duty which was not collected on goods lauded from the same steamer a few days previously in Hobart. The Hobart goods were discharged before the primage duties operated; they were imposed after the vessel left Hobart but before she reached Launceston. The question I asked to-day was whether the Government would consider the matter of remitting the primage duties which had to be paid by the northern importers of Tasmania and not by the southern importers on the same class of cargo. The answer I received was - </para>

                        <para>- It would not be the first time a Minister has broken the law in order to remove an injustice. The honorable senator knows of similar cases and that there is a general feeling that the Customs Act should be amended so that there may be no differentiation between different parts of a State with regard to the incidence of customs duties. I hope, therefore, he will do something in the matter. Cases have occurred in which vessels have discharged at Sydney, and have not reached Melbourne before certain customs duties have been imposed, but I do not know of another instance of customs duties being imposed while a vessel is proceeding from one port of a State to another port in the same State. In all earnestness, I suggest that the Minister should, ascertain if it is possible to give relief to the Launceston importers, but if he finds that it is impossible for him to do it, I hope he will take early steps to prevent any recurrence of such a manifest injustice. The imposition of the primage duties at this particular time presses very harshly on a section of importers in Tasmania. In doing business with clients all over the State it handicaps them 2£ per cent, in comparison with the importers in the southern part of Tasmania. </para>

                <para>The Tariff Board Act which was passed by both Houses of Parliament in 192:1, provides that the Tariff Board must, from time to time, report to the Minister for Trade and Customs upon the capability of Australian manufacturers to supply reasonable quantities of goods for which deferred duties are provided in the customs tariff, and if it reports that any Australian manufacturer is in a position to supply a reasonable quantity of a commodity, for which a deferred duty is provided, the Minister may make that duty operative. It is not obligatory upon him to do so. The 1926 tariff imposed a duty of 2s. per 100 square ft. on sheet glass and a deferred duty of l£d. per lb. or 12s. 6d. per 100 square ft., which deferred rate was subsequently imposed on the report of the Tariff Board that evidence taken by it disclosed that a certain manufacturer in Australia would, in a very short- period, be able to provide a reasonable quantity of window glass for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am not discussing the tariff. This preliminary explanation is necessary in order to make myself understood. It was provided that on and after the 1st July, 1926, the duty should  become operative, presuming that glass was then being manufactured. From year to year, the duty was further deferred, and only a few months ago, by a Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notification, it was deferred until August, 1930. Notwithstanding the publication of that notice, the Minister for Trade and Customs took it upon himself on 19th June to bring into operation that duty, although not one square foot of such glass has been manufactured in Australia. Surely the Minister should not be above the law. 1 enter my vigorous protest against this action of a member of the Commonwealth Government in setting an example to the people to break the law. </para>

                    <para>. - If the honorable senator, who has just resumed his scat really appreciated the significance of what he has said about the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> I should take very strong exception to his remarks. The Minister has done nothing unlawful, as the honorable senator would learn if he studied the system of legislation by proclamation. Constitutional provision exists for the repeal of any proclamation. I advise him, before placing on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> a statement which might be misconstrued outside Parliament, to he more careful of his facts, and of his language. </para>
