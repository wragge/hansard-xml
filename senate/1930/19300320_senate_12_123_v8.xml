Legislation  to  give effect  to  the proposals of the Government will be introduced at an early date, when the fullest information possible will he afforded honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> was moving the motion for the adjournment of the Senate on Friday last, he referred to a statement I had made on the adjournment on the previous night relative to certain action which had been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G. Theodore, Commonwealth Treasurer, when he was Premier and Treasurer of Queensland, and he charged me with having inaccurately accused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> of having brought about a reduction of wages in Queensland without the intervention of the Arbitration Court. I have since communicated with Queensland with a view to ascertaining the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said - </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline>stated that the Federal Treasurer, whilst Premier and Treasurer of Queensland, reduced the wages of civil servants of that State without the intervention of the Arbitration Court. That statement in inaccurate. </para>
          <para class="block">As a matter of fact I find that in 1922 the Queensland Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> passed what was known as the Salaries Act, imposing a reduction of 5 per cent on all salaries over £300 per annum, and even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> in the course of his remarks, said - </para>
          <para>A measure was introduced to reduce by 5 per cent, the salaries of the higher paid public servants. </para>
          <para class="block">There could, therefore, have been no inaccuracy in that particular part of my statement. At the time that act was brought into operation there was in existence an embargo against certain members of the Queensland Public Service going to the Arbitration Court. It operated in respect of officers receiving £300 per annum and over from 1917 to 1920, and again from 1921 to 1924. But as it was repealed for a short time just prior to the elections in October, 1920, and re-imposed in February, 1921. there was nothing, had the Queensland Government desired it, to prevent these officers of the Public Service from coming under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, so that their salaries could have been dealt with in a proper way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> also spoke of the reduction of the basic wage in Queensland. I am not at all peeved at his statement concerning me in this respect, because I recognize that it  was  handed to him by the Treasurer. </para>

I want to point out to him that it was the then Government in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> being Premier and Treasurer, which petitioned the Arbitration Court, and that petition, which was signed by every Minister, succeeded in obtaining the reduction in the basic wage payable in the Public Service to the extent I have already indicated. The preamble of the award given by the judge in the Arbitration Court which made this reduction, includes the following :  - </para>

          </quote>
          <para>Clearly, the move to reduce the basic wage in Queensland was not instituted by the Public Service Board or the Arbitration Court; it was the result  of  an appeal made to the Arbitration Court by every Minister of the Grown, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> who was at the time Premier and Treasurer in the Queensland Government. I make this statement now to clear up the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> but I may add that about the same time automatic increases under awards and agreements were stopped by the Government by the issue of Orders in Council, hours of labour were increased by a petition to the court by the Government, 1,120 employees were sacked and 4,247 were affected by a pooling of work. </para>

          <para>I replied that I would have the figures verified. I now wish to state that the figures furnished in relation to expenditure in the State of South Australia were supplied by the State authorities in control of road construction. In a telegram, received yesterday by the Department of Works from the Commissioner for Highways, South Australia, the expenditure to date from moneys provided by the Commonwealth Government is stated to be £25,000. With regard to his remarks in connexion with expenditure incurred in the State of New South Wales, I wish to point out that the figures quoted by the right honorable the Prime Minister were furnished by the New South Wales Main Roads Board as representing expenditure on the roads included in the authorized programme. </para>

            <para>. - I do not intend to delay the Senate at considerable length.I gather from the last sentence in the ministerial statement that honorable senators are invited to express themselves with candour with a view to assisting the Government at this critical period in our affairs. Apparently the statement was issued with the object of encouraging a spirit of co-operation between all sections of political thought in this chamber and elsewhere; and at the same time of administering one or two political thrust? against the party at present in Opposition. In addition to the appeal for co-operation, there is, as one honorable senator suggested, an S.O.S. call running right through the ministerial statement. This invitation to cooperate has been treated much more cordially than a similar invitation extended to the Opposition by the previous Government. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> who said that gibes had been hurled at the Government by honorable senators on this side of the chamber should compare what he terms gibe's and criticisms of the Government's programme with the charges which were made against the Government of which I was a member. Prior to the last general election the olive branch was held out to all sections of the community, and an endeavour was made to hold a peace in industry conference, but our efforts in thai direction were completely broken down by the political activities of those gentlemen who are now in office. These are things which we cannot readily forget. While in the interests of the nation, honorable senators on this side of the chamber will respond to the invitation of the Government, we cannot do so without recalling what actually Happened when a similar appeal was made by a previous Government. Whilst we are being asked to co-operate in endeavouring to improve Australia's economic and financial position, we are also being asked to act in some respects in a way which is diametrically opposed to our political principles. We are reminded of our heavy adverse trade balance; but at the same time we are informed that certain action is to be taken in a direction which violates many of those principles to which we have always strictly adhered. In these circumstances it is almost impossible for us to discuss the Government's invitation to co-operate without commenting to some extent on the other phase of the Government's programme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> angered probably by a statement handed to me when he was speaking, went out of his way to attack the wheat merchants of this country, whom he said were riding on the backs of the farmers. I remind the honorable senator, however, that if there is one section of this community that is entitled to all the assistance it can get, and which works hard for the return it receives, it is the men who work on the land. The Assistant Minister made some derogatory references to- certain big firms whose signatures appear on a document 'concerning the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool. He said that these organizations did not represent the pioneers of this country; but let me remind the honorable senator that one of the firms to which he referred bears the name of a family of which Australia should bc proud, and which has always been closely associated with the progress and development of the Commonwealth. A few days ago the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in opening the Entomological section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Canberra, referred to the name I have in mind. On reflection I feel sure that the Assistant Minister will see that there was no justification for the remarks he made. The honorable senator also made an at tack upon the banking institutions of Australia, which he said were drying up the wells of credit in this country, and that it would not be long before the present Government would make credits available to the producer's. There is an answer to such accusations, particularly when we remember that Commonwealth bonds, which bear interest up to 6 per cent., with certain remissions in the matter of taxation, are the best investment in Australia. It is very easy for the honorable senator to throw bricks at the banks and other such institutions, but what is the real position? There is a shortage of money, as the Government is well aware. When it endeavoured to raise additional funds it found that it had to pay <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> cent., or whatever rate was then ruling, but on its conversion loan it had to pay 6 per cent. That should be sufficient proof of the fact that neither the banks nor any one else is responsible for our position. The banks will advance only on approved securities, and I have yet to learn that the Minister, the Commonwealth Bank, or the Treasury officials would lend money unless there were some security to ensure repayment. If money is to be made available on any other basis Parliament should be informed. The farmers in Australia have been placed in a false position in consequence of the operations of the Canadian wheat pool and the Farmers' Central Reserve Board in America. It was reported that an increased price would be available during the months of February and March,- and, consequently, the growers held back large quantities of their produce in anticipation of higher prices. That is unfortunate for individual farmers as they will probably have to accept less for their produce, and it is also unsatisfactory from a national viewpoint. One has only to peruse the figures to determine that if this wheat had been disposed of in the ordinary way, money would have been available in Australia for developmental purposes. Ultimately the banks finance the" farmers. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; but in the end it is the banks which make credits available to our primary producers. Where do they get the money? Although it is true that some credits are sent from overseas, in the main they borrow it from the financial institutions of this country. The storekeepers of this country get the money they require either from the merchants or the banking institutions. The holding up of our wheat has helped  to dry up the wells of money and to make our financial position more difficult. </para>

              <para>- They have no say in the matter. The adverse trade balance and, to some extent, prodigal expenditure, is the reason for Australia's present economic position. The Government has singled out the main producing section of the community to assist in balancing the ledger, and as an inducement is offering a guaranteed price for the product of their labour. I fail to see any difference in principle between the Government's appeal to the wheat-growers to grow more wheat and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> appeal to the workers of Australia to lay more bricks.

A careful examination of the figures will show him that he has fallen into the error of applying too literally the figures in the budget Statement. The honorable senator said that between 1924-25 and 1928-29 governmental expenditure had increased by £18,000,000. The report of the Auditor-General on the Treasurer's statement for the year ended 30th June, 1929, summarizes the position very succinctly - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator B.</inline>D. Elliott referred to the exchange of preferences between Australia and Great Britain. While on sentimental grounds we are all in agreement with the honorable senator, I cannot help feeling with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> that the people of Britain have been slow to take advantage of the preferences we have given to the Mother Country. It took the British motor car industry, for instance, a long time to produce a car to meet Australia's needs. That the manufacturers of Britain were capable of rising to the occasion is now seen in the favorable comment that one type of British car has evoked. While we all desire an increase of inter-Empire trade, the authorities in the Homeland must see that the goods they send to Australia are suitable. I grant that the problem of providing machinery for a market of 6,000,000 people is one that needs consideration. But Australia must not be thought of in terms of a population of 6,000,000. As time passes her numbers and requirements will increase, and those who visualize this country as a little Britain of the southern seas should think rather of the future than of the present. I do not for a moment desire to throw cold water on the proposed reciprocity of trade between this country and the Motherland; hut I do believe that some of the observations that fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> in that regard were justified. </para>
          <para>The Government has asked for friendly criticism and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> in response, suggested that some of our difficulties in regard to overseas' borrowing are due to the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. I differ from the honorable senator; I do not see any disability in that respect. I draw his attention to the provision in that agreement which makes it possible for the Loan Council, by a unanimous vote, to allow any State to go on the market in its own name to borrow any amount agreed upon. So that the financial agreement does not tie the hands of the States. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> might answer that argument by claiming that the Loan Council would never be unanimous on the point. I believe that the Loan Council would be the first to endeavour to give relief if the position were detrimental to Australia. I share the opinion of eminent British and American financiers that tie inauguration of the Loan Council has done a great deal to stabilize Australia's finances overseas. I have had an opportunity of listening to criticism from a number of people who have the ear of financiers in Great Britain, and they also are practically unanimous that the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States is one of the best things that this country has done to stabilize its finances overseas. </para>
          <para>The difficulties that have arisen are due to the adverse trade balance, which is referred to in the ministerial statement, and to excessive borrowing overseas. I am aware that contrary views are held with regard to a young country such as Australia borrowing overseas. On the one hand there are those who cry, "Let the Government borrow overseas, as money borrowed in the country for governmental purposes is taken out of industry, and leaves so much less with which to develop its national resources." Others, use the argument that, if money is borrowed here, both it and the interest involved are circulated within the country. </para>

              <para>- I agree that it would. I believe that the internal position of Australia is absolutely sound. The best evidence of that is the great success of its internal conversion loans. At the same time the success of our internal conversion loans is not a factor upon which we should preen ourselves too much. I admit having been a sinner in that respect. I remember that, when I was overseas in 1928, Australia converted a loan of £20,000,000 internally, which was over-subscribed a. month or two months before the normal closing date. I took the opportunity to expound to Australia's friends in Great Britain, through the machinery then at my disposal, upon the magnificent financial foundation of this country. Undoubtedly its internal position is magnificent; but there is less evidence of its external financial soundness. </para>

          <para>I am somewhat diffident about discussing our external position, because I hope, at some future date, to debate the matter at length in this chamber. The ministerial statement makes an endeavour to grapple with that position by overcoming our adverse trade balance. The method suggested is to increase the export of wheat. There are other ways in which we could assist matters; by increasing the export of coal, for instance. In previous years our coal export trade was a very important factor in the country's prosperity. We could also stimulate the export of our beef, and I believe that it will be increased very materially within the next few years. The fourth industry that needs stimulation overseas is our wool industry. At the moment our coal industry is a decaying one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> indicated the decreased coal consumption by steamships, , and what might happen to our own East- West Railway. I was reminded the other night that it was originally suggested - I believe by the then Minister for Railways - that the engines traversing that line should be of the internal combustion type. It would probably have been an advantage to Australia had the suggestion been adopted. The country has undoubtedly suffered excessively from industrial unrest in the coal industry. At the same &gt;time the position of Australia's beef industry has improved, and there is promise of a continuance of that improvement. That is due to a few specific measures. As all honorable senators know meat from Argentine arrives in London in a better condition than Australian meat because it is chilled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may tell us that that will be altered as a result of the investigations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but when I was at Smithfield and saw Australian frozen beef alongside Argentine chilled beef, I did not wonder at the consumers' preference for the latter. </para>

              <para>- I hope it continues to do so, but the lack of demand for Australian beef in England is due to the cause I have mentioned, which in all probability would continue but for one great factor in Australia's favour. The United States of America with its 120,000,000 people is fast reaching the stage when it must import beef, and as Argentine is the closest spot where it can obtain supplies, it is making contracts with the beef -producers in that country for shipments of chilled beef. This has given Australia an opportunity to get its beef on the London market. </para>

          <para>There is talk of rectifying our trade position overseas by the export of more wool and mention of a subsidy on wool. The worst thing that ever happened to the wool industry of Australia was the extremely high prices maintained for  too  long a period. The result has been that the chemists of France and Germany and Central Europe generally have been experimenting to find substitutes for the wool, which because of its high price, the people of their countries could not afford to buy; and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has often pointed out in the Senate,, they have succeeded in devising quite a good substitute. The latest factory, built in Alsace-Lorraine, engaged in producing a substitute for wool, has now, owing to the reduced price of wool on the London market, gone into liquidation. The law of supply and demand has begun  to  operate. "When the price of wool was high, artificial substitutes came into use, but they cannot compete with wool at a low price. The lesson is one which the pastoralists and governments of Australia may well take to heart. I venture to think that in the end wool will triumph over these artificial substitutes, but not at the price which  the  people  in the  industry nave obtained in the past. </para>
          <para>Now turning to another paragraph in the ministerial statement, wheat  is to be <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> subject of what I might call a bounty. </para>
          <para class="block">At any rate a fixed price is to be paid for wheat for a period of one year, and the objective, I take it, is that it may contribute something towards rectifying the trade balance. I know that the Australian farmer has suffered a great deal and that he has worked for less than the basic wage; I have every sympathy with him; but I want to save him from himself. In many cases 4s. at railway siding or 4s. 8d. a bushel f .o.b. for wheat will not cover the cost of production, and by the" payment of this price the Government will do twofold injury to the people of this country. It will injure the farmer by stimulating him to produce more wheat, and if wheat is not worth 4s. or 4s. 8d. a bushel it will injure the nation which has to find the money to pay the farmer the fixed price. The wheat, wool and beef markets are all uncertain, and to-day the only one which has an upward tendency is the beef market. In regard to wheat, without any necessity for it, the Canadian Government has established a wheat pool that will result in tremendous loss to the Canadian people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Legge,</inline> who was recently head and shoulders in the pooling system to control supplies and increase the prices of commodities, is now telling the farmers of the United States of America to plant 10 per cent, less land and by that means hold the prices they have hitherto enjoyed. The proof of this is to be found in the steps now being taken by European countries to protect themselves against any attempt to levy on them something more than they ought to pay for wheat. In Italy for some time past white bread has not been eaten. Duties on wheat have been imposed by Germany, France and Italy and in the case of France, there is specific rate of duty on wheat imported from Australia. The people of these countries are eating rye bread which, according to the medical profession, is not at all a bad substitute for white bread. For these reasons, apart from others I can give, it would, in my opinion, be very unwise to take the double risk I have already indicated, that of injuring first the primary producers and secondly the nation. It may he claimed that markets can bc developed in the East, but why are they not developed? 1" know that at  the present moment one Eastern market is being sought for Australian produce but it is a very limited one. 1 have more than once declared that the wheat producers of Australia were living on the top of a volcano which was getting nearer and nearer to explosion. That volcano is Russian production. Russia has been gradually improving the condition of its primary industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford,</inline> the great tractor manufacturer, has already established a factory in the country for the purpose of manufacturing tractors to deal with the harvest there. Russia is approaching the stage when she can export wheat and, when she does, the price of wheat will be one probably unparalleled for lowness in the history of Australia. I trust that our producers will not be allured and led to believe that there is stability in their industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford</inline> would not have gone to the expense and trouble of starting a factory in Russia unless there was some evidence that the Republic was about to take part in production again. When she does, she will flood the markets of the world. </para>

          <para>The Government has invited us to state our views and I state mine frankly and fully. I would have no compulsory pool, it cuts right across my political principle to' hand over to any Government the great primary industries of this country to play with. We shall however have another opportunity to discuss the matter when the necessary legislation comes before the Senate, but one cannot help saying that the proposal . to fix a price for wheat shows how" anxious the Government is to placate the farmer because of the irritation to which he has been subjected for years. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister wants us to sit <inline font-style="italic">us</inline> an economic conference and for that reason I wish to say that the comparative failure of the tariff is, owing first of all to our lack of population - unless the manufacturer has a sufficiently numerous home market, he cannot produce his goods at a low cost - and, in the second place, to the high, cost of transport. That difficulty cannot be overcome. Although an article is produced at a reasonable cost, it must as far as possible be served out in Australia at a level, price, but the transport of the article has added tremendously to the overhead cost. </para>
          <para>There are one or two extraordinary economic statements in the ministerial statement. We are told that employment is the " barometer of prosperity " and that " production would be much increased if those who are now unemployed could be placed in useful work." I do not know whether the Government regards honorable senators as a lot of children in a nursery, but I am sure we can all. subscribe 'to such an economic sentiment of the school-room type. There is, however, another extraordinary statement which I venture to think will hit the economist in the eye. It is the following: - lt would 'be a policy of despair to declare that costs of production and development are too high to permit of the expansion of our industries. </para>
          <para class="block">I venture to think that Ministers do not really subscribe to that brand of economics. That sentence was included in the ministerial statement because Ministers feared that they would be accused of attempting to reduce wages, and they are so politically sensitive and such masters of political strategy that they did not intend to allow even a suggestion that wages should be reduced. On the contrary, they went to the other extreme and declared that there must be no reduction in the cost of production. This is entirely contrary to public opinion in the Commonwealth. Practically the whole of the people arc convinced that the cost of production must come down. This does not connote, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pointed out, a reduction in wages. . </para>

              <para>- It can be accomplished in a thousand ways. The cost of transport, to take only one illustration, materially affects our costs of  production. Before they leave office the Ministry will either have to adopt this policy or allow this country to sink into oblivion.. This economic nonsense which the right honorable the Prime Minister has included in the ministerial statement is in absolute contradiction of economic facts as they affect the position of the Commonwealth. He is now asking the farmers of the Commonwealth to increase production. How will it be possible for them to produce more wheat at a remunerative price under existing conditions? But we are told that the Government intends to give them a guaranteed price which in itself is an admission that the present cost of production is too high. </para>

              <para>- The fact that it is too high, of course, is the reason for the proposed guarantee. This proposal - because, after all, there is only one with regard to our overseas trade balance - is a mere stopgap. Suppose that all I have said is wrong, that the price of wheat keeps up and the Government is able to finance the compulsory wheat pool, the increase in wheat production will not, of itself, square the national ledger. Wool prices are down, and there is little prospect of their recovery in the near future. A more permanent and safer means must be adopted to balance our trade ledger. Although the trade balance is against us at the moment, there is no reason for alarm concerning the internal position of the Commonwealth. I can promise the Government that, having regard to the difficult position in which Australia is placed, I shall give careful consideration to every measure that is submitted to this chamber. I recall how gloomy was the outlook at the outbreak of war in 1914, and I well remember the remark of one eminent man, " Whatever happens we will still have our country." I believe that if, in our present difficulties, we apply safe business principles to their solution, we shall be able to make Australia absolutely self-contained financially and economically. </para>

            <para>.   -  Without exception, previous speakers on the Opposition side have assured us that it is not their intention to advocate a reduction in wages. It is, however, significant that they all expressed the belief that the cost of living must be reduced; in other words, that there must be an increase in production. I cannot imagine production being increased without a reduction in interest, rents, and profits. I cannot imagine, for instance, any building being erected more cheaply unless the value of existing buildings is correspondingly reduced. </para>

What I am concerned about is the statements that are being circulated as to the intentions of honorable senators opposite with regard to the reduction of wages. I doubt the truth of those assertions, and I cite the action of the Premier of New South Wales, who, it is reported, is about to introduce a bill to increase the hours of work on the New South Wales railways from 44 to 48 hours a week. It might be argued that this does not mean a reduction in wage3. It does. If a man has to work 50 hours a week instead of 44 for the same rate of pay, his wages per hour are reduced. </para>

              <para>- And we have proved over and over again that when the hour3 of work are reduced from 48 to 44 there is no material increase in the cost of production. It has been urged that the position of the New South Wales railways demands drastic action to reduce working costs. The causes lie deeper than that. There has been a complete change in the transport system in recent years. The road that is being constructed from Sydney to Newcastle, following the railway line, will be largely used in the near future. Motor traffic haulage on that highway will be a serious competitor with the railway system. Similar difficulties arose when the railway line from Sydney to Newcastle was opened. </para>

          <para class="block">The shipping companies which, up till then, had been doing good business, went out of commission, because they were not able to face the competition of the railway. . Now the railway authorities, in their turn, are feeling the competition by owners of motor vehicles. A reduction in wages will not solve their difficulty, because the railway, as a system of transport, is, like coal-mining, practically a dying industry. </para>

Much more money is squandered in maladministration in one week than is required to keep wages in industry up to their present level for twelve months. In many instances, thousands of pounds are squandered through the use of faulty plans and specifications- in connexion with big undertakings, and very little is said about it. In New South Wales, many such glaring examples have been smothered. Men also have been put into positions for which they are totally unfit. </para>

If it costs £20 to produce a bale of wool, and the grower can only sell it for £15, how can we hope for any increase in our export of wool ? If it costs 4s.6d. to produce a bushel of wheat, and the. grower can only get 4s. 3d. for it, how can he increase his output of wheat? So that the essential condition of any real and permanent increase in production for export is that the cost of production in Australia should be low enough to enable the grower to make a profit when he sells at the prices obtainable in the world's markets. </para>

          <para class="block">That is a most important point, and one which has to be taken into consideration in studying the question of increased production. It is not difficult for us to recall the conditions which prevailed in the wheat-growing and pastoral industries some years ago. I remember the day when only primitive mechanical appliances were available for cultivating the land and harvesting the crop, and when a farmer cultivating a thousand acres of land would require the assistance of 30 employees. But to-day, owing to the use of improved appliances, most of that work is done, by the farmer with the assistance of his sons or possibly a neighbour. During the past ten years, wheat production has increased by100 per cent., and notwithstanding the introduction of improved agricultural machinery, the cost of production is still very high. </para>

              <para>- The workers and consumers are not in a better position, but there are many farmers who possess motor cars, comfortable dwellings and generally live under conditions infinitely better than those which prevailed years ago. Although frequent reference is made to the necessity of reducing wages and the cost of production, no mention is ever made of the necessity of reducing the cost of necessary commodities or of excessive interest, rents and profits. The cry has always been that we should produce more, which means, first of all, a reduction in wages. In 1911, flour was selling at £22 per ton and bread was 6d. a loaf; but in 1928 and 1929, when it was £11 a ton, bread was still the same price. </para>

              <para>- That would not be responsible for the difference. It has been said that the adoption of day baking and a reduction in working hours are responsible for the price of bread remaining at its present high level, but it is nothing of the kind. At present, there are, in this country, thousands of men out of employment who are willing to work, but who find it impossible to buy bread at 6d. per loaf. No attempt has been made by those who are so concerned about increased production to reduce the price of essential commodities. I do not think there is a working man or woman in Australia who would be seriously opposed to a reasonable reduction in wages if the price of bread and other essential commodities were correspondingly reduced. There is no justification for suggesting that the workers' standard of living should be reduced while the banks are charging high rates of interest, and manufacturers are permitted to make excessive profits. </para>

The banking institutions always take advantage of the financial situation, and when borrowers are " broke " the banks arc still on top.

            <para>That trade is all in the hands of five firms.

Those are the five firms that control this trade. Those five firms carry the beef over the Atlantic, bring it to this market, and sell it here. One of them, Vestey's, has, I think, about 3,000 retail stores. It is a pretty big business. It is a very interesting position (A voice, " He has got the cold storage of England."). </para>

          <para>The Government realizes the seriousness of the position confronting Australia. Some honorable senators say that it has sent out an S.O.S. signal. There is no need to do that, for, surely, the need is itself a call to every one to put his shoulder to the wheel. The object of the Government is to stimulate industry. We have in Australia a market for all we can produce; but there can be no sufficient home market if large numbers of our people are out of employment. For that reason, if for no other, the Government is grappling with the unemployment problem. It is offering encouragement to local manufacturers with a view to increasing employment. When our unemployment problem has been solved, the Government hopes to encourage people from overseas to come here. But until that times arrives, it feels that it is advisable to restrict immigration. Throughout the world two different systems operate in industry. In the United States of America, where to a large extent machinery has taken the place of manual labour, there is a large army of unemployed, many of whom are on the verge of starvation. In Australia and Great Britain industry is on a different footing; nevertheless, in those countries unemployment, with its attendant privations, exists. It is the plain duty of the Government to try to find means to alleviate this suffering. In its effort to do so it should receive the support of every person who loves his country. If all sections unite to that end, we shall soon see a silver lining to the dark cloud which now overshadows us. </para>

            <para>. - With other honorable senators who have spoken, I agree that we should all do our best to assist in finding a solution of the difficulties which confront us as a people. I am glad that the party now in power has at last realized the difficult time through which we are passing. Twelve months ago the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> advocated that party differences be sunk and that we should give our undivided attention to the study of our economic position. Apparently the present occupants of the Treasury bench did not then realize the seriousness of the situation, for they were not prepared to work in co-operation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce.</inline> I feel confident that we can overcome our present difficulties, for I have unbounded faith in the worth and commonsense of the people of Australia. But if we are to get out of our troubles, we must all be prepared to do our part. My experience of the workers of Queensland convinces me that if the workers generally realized our true position they would be prepared to give of their best, provided that their industrial and political leaders permitted them to do so. Indeed, we should never have reached our present position if the workers had been left alone. I cannot agree with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> regarding what he called the bad old days when conditions comparable with the days of slavery were said to exist in this country. Industrial conditions have altered so considerably during the last ten or fifteen years that I feel sure there is no danger of a recurrence of those conditions. A fair day's work should be given in return for a fair day's pay. </para>

              <para>- I am not saying that we do, or do not get it ; I am merely stating what should be an axiom. Although I am not a large employer of labour, I have had some experience with the workers of this country. I have always received from them a fair return for the wages they have been paid. But there must be something wrong for the present unsatisfactory conditions to exist. Seeing that all wages are now determined by arbitration, it must be assumed that they are fair wages. There is, however, no authority to say what is a fair day's work. The progress of civilization has made it a great deal more difficult than formerly for an individual to make a success in life. Take, for instance, civil aviation. One can now step into a plane in Brisbane at 8 a.m., and be in Sydney at 12.30 p.m. on the same day. That saves the person concerned some 24 hours that would otherwise be taken up in train travelling. Naturally, it gives that individual another 24 hours, if desired, in which to work. It is a logical influence, therefore, that modern conditions tend to make work more intensive. The man who wishes to be successful must work more strenuously and with greater concentration. And a similar remark applies to national prosperity. Australia cannot afford to be left behind in the world's competition for markets. It cannot safely indulge in a policy of quiet and comfortable isolation. It must adopt the intensive and efficient practices that are in vogue abroad. </para>

              <para>- No; I refer to the methods adopted by countries which have a white population. A sparsely-populated country such as ours cannot expect to be allowed to live in a glass case. It must compete with the world. Australia owes a good deal of its high reputation to its hard-working citizens and its hard-fighting expeditionary force, and we must maintain those traditions in our civil life. This country is extraordinarily well endowed by nature to compete successfully with the rest of the world. It is left to its citizens to assist to develop its potentialities. </para>

          <para>It has been mentioned that organization is the chief factor in the successful carrying on of an industry. To a certain extent I concur. But organization without the co-operation of labour is useless. I cite the Queensland sugar industry as an excellent example of able organization. Worth something like £11,000,000 per annum to Australia, that industry directly and indirectly gives employment to about 100,000 people, and pays £6,000,000 per annum in wages. Honorable senators will appreciate its extensiveness and its importance to Australia. Although it is assisted by the embargo placed on the importation of foreign sugar, it has to compete in the markets of the world when it exports its surplus production. It costs only from £3,000 to £4,000 per annum to administer the operations of the industry. In Queensland the average production is 1 ton of sugar from 7.07 tons of cane - a sugar content extraction that is not equalled anywhere else in the world. That speaks volumes for the efficiency of the organization of the industry. </para>

              <para>- Java has always been quoted to me as one of the most favorably endowed countries for the production of sugar; but I do not think that there is any better land in the world for the purpose than that to be found in the north of Queensland. One of the North Queensland mills averaged 1 ton of sugar from every 6.5 tons of cane crushed - a world's record. I quote those figures to support my contention that organization, coupled with labour cooperation, must achieve success. No men work harder than those employed on the sugar lands in the production of sugar. Yet the high cost of production necessitated by general living conditions in Australia has made it impossible for this country to compete on an economic basis with the prices obtaining in the open markets of the world. Every ton of Queensland sugar exported reduces the return to the grower, so that the industry is now in an unenviable position. The more that the sugar-farmer produces over and above the sugar consumed in Australia, the greater the loss he has to bear. I am hopeful that means will be found to utilize on a profitable basis the surplus production that we are faced with in the sugar industry. </para>

          <para class="block">Something has already been done to reduce costs in the Queensland pastoral industry. The wool industry has been frequently and exhaustively debated in this chamber, and I do not propose to refer to it from a Commonwealth point of view. I shall confine myself to its Queensland section. For some two years the price received for Queensland wool has been less than the cost of production. The average price received in that State  at the recent Brisbane sales for 1 lb. of greasy wool was 10d., while it takes 12½d. to produce 1 lb. of wool in a reasonable season. During the last few years, owing to the necessity for hand-feeding in drought conditions, I have known many instances of wool costing as much as 5s. 7d. per lb. to produce. It must be apparent to all that that condition of affairs cannot last long. If it continues, the small settlers will be compelled to leave their holdings. A large number of pastoral workers will have to join them and carry their swags from the sheep districts, to drift to the cities to swell the ranks of the unemployed. The large holdings will continue to exist a little longer, and will probably re-absorb the small properties. That would stultify the closer settlement activities of our State Governments, which have for some years been cutting up large holdings for closer settlement. It is obvious that a small property with 3,000 to 4,000 sheep cannot be run as economically as a large holding with 50,000 to 100,000 sheep. </para>
          <para>To illustrate the startling decline in the prices received for wool during the past few years, I quote the following figures, which are interesting and instructive. They relate only to Queensland :  - </para>

              <para>- No, unfortunately the pastoralist in Queensland was too busy devising means whereby he could save from the ravages of the drought what stock he had left. The Commonwealth Government did consider a plan of rationing wool for a period. Personally I should be sorry to see the holding up of large quantities of wool at the present time. If 300,000 or 400,000 bales of wool per year were tied up and unsold, the world's buyers would be aware of this and no doubt it would create a grave lack of confidence in the stabilization of the prices of wool. Moreover, the financing of the carry-over clip and the current season's clip would be a severe drain on the financial resources of the country. </para>

          <para>SenatorCOOPER.- We all admit that, but the 1923-1924 season, for which I have given the figures, was a reasonable period. In that year in Queensland we received £12,000,000 for 107,000,000 lb. of wool. Other honorable senators have indicated that the exceptionally high price of wool has probably been one of the causes of our present difficulties. The wool-grower certainly cannot be blamed for this state of affairs. I think all will agree that the pastoralists would be better off if they could be assured of a flat rate, such as the 15d. per lb. they were paid during the war, but so far, no means of arriving at a flat rate has been found. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has called upon the primary industries for greater production so that Australia may have more wealth to export overseas to assist in restoring our trade balance in the markets of the world. It is a very sound idea. But at the same time I think that the primary producer would be better off if some effort were made on the part of the Government to bring about a reduction in the price of the material, implements and goods he has to buy from secondary industries. If the price of the articles the primary producer buys were more on a parity with the price which he gets for his produce in the open markets of the world, it would greatly stimulate the primary industries in the production of more wealth. </para>
          <para>Successful endeavours have been made in Queensland to revise costs of production in the primary industries. Freights have been reduced and shearing rates and the wages of station hands have been revised in an award by the Arbitration Court. It is interesting to note that the heads of the Australian Workers Union recommended the members of the organization to accept the reduced rates. For some years now the pastoralist has been running his property at a loss. I know it is the general opinion that if a man has a bit of land and a few sheep he is wealthy, but it is far from the truth, as I know from personal experience. The pastoralist may make some profit during good seasons, but he may have bad seasons when that profit is turned into a loss. I am, therefore, pleased to note the gesture from the heads of the Australian Workers Union; I am pleased that they recognize the need for assisting the pastoral industry. Of course there is no guarantee that the industry will be able to tide itself over the very difficult time through which it is passing, but the action of the Australian Workers Union shows that there is among the members of the organization some feeling that there is need for their co-operation in order to assist the pastoralists. We have had very bountiful rains in Queensland since the beginning of the present year, and the position is very much brighter than it was three months ago. Grass is assured for the next seven or eight months, and the pastoralists will have an opportunity to ascertain what they can do to put their industry on a profitable basis. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley,</inline>the previous  speaker,  said that banks would only make an advance up to 60 per cent. of the value of the asset offered as security, and that they were always practically certain of coming out on top. Although I am by no means a champion of the banks and financial institutions, I must say, in all fairness to them, that in many cases in Queensland where men have suffered very severely from drought conditions, they have not only advanced up to the full amount of the holding, but have also, now that the season has broken, afforded further assistance to enable holders to re-stock their holdings so that the land may become again productive and be of some use to the Commonwealth. The banks have not always gone in and sold up the pastoralist. I mention this because it creates a false impression not to challenge a statement that the banks practically are just waiting to grab the land of the man who has gone down. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to hear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> did not wish to draw the inference I have attributed to him. The help given by the employees of Queensland to improve the pastoral industry has evidently had the effect of reducing the percentage of unemployment. Although in my opinion the percentage of unemployment in Queensland is still too high and should be reduced as rapidly as possible, it is only 7.05 per cent., according to the figures made available last month, compared with 13 per cent., which is the average for the Commonwealth. </para>

Adding the levies to these figures, the community of coal-miners alone, never numbering more than 24,000 persons at any time, has lost through illegitimate stoppages no less than £9,700,000, or about £400 per employee. </para>

          <para class="block">I hope the Government will not interfere with the Transport Workers Act. That measure has been in operation now for eighteen months, and it has been of immense benefit to our primary producers, particularly in Queensland. Prior to November, 1928, primary products were being continually held up at the various Queensland ports and, as a consequence, the producers suffered heavy losses. The position changed entirely immediately the act came into force. There have been no serious stoppages at Queensland coastal ports during the last eighteen months. On the contrary, all the work has proceeded smoothly, stevedoring costs have been reduced in some of the ports as much as 50 per cent., greatly reducing production costs and the large numbers of men working at Bowen, Mackay and Townsville are thoroughly satisfied with their conditions of employment. If the Transport Workers Act is amended drastically, I am afraid that primary producers throughout Australia will be again exposed to all the loss that follows dislocation of work at our seaports. I sincerely hope that the Government will not tamper with a measure that has proved so satisfactory in operation. </para>

            <para>.- The tone of the speeches delivered by honorable senators opposite, and the manner in which they received the Government's statement of policy, must indeed be gratifying to the Ministry. Whilst there has been some criticism of the Government's proposals and the principles for which the Government stands, there has been running through all the speeches a tardy recognition of the fact that the Government's policy is the only one which will arrest the drift in our economic affairs, and place the people of this country again on the road to prosperity. I was almost afraid when my colleague from South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> rose to speak, that the harmony which had characterized the debate was about to be destroyed because, in the earlier stages of his remarks, he adopted a challenging attitude. He accused the Government of seeking co-operation on political principles concerning which there is a sharp conflict of opinion. It is natural that there should always be a difference in viewpoint between honorable senators who sit behind the Government and those in Opposition. Their presence in this chamber, and in another place, is an indication that there are two important political parties in Australia, each of which seeks to give effect to its aspirations by the strength with which it returns representatives to this Parliament. It is obvious that the majority of the people of Australia believe that the principles for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> and his party stand are the cause of some of Australia's present difficulties. Certainly it cannot be said that the present Government, or the party which supports it, is responsible, because prior to last October it was almost beyond the memory of the average citizen to recall when a Labour Government had last graced the treasury bench, in this Parliament, so long was the interim between the defeat of the last Labour Government and the accession to office of the present Ministry. </para>

It is true that for some years Tasmania had a Labour Government, but it existed more or less on sufferance from the Legislative Council where the party opposed to Labour had a majority. The same position obtained in the other States, with the exception of Queensland, and I presume that even the Leader of the Opposition will not argue that Queensland has been the cause of all the economic and financial evils that now beset this country. </para>

          <para>During this debate, we have heard criticisms of the Government's policy, also some faint praise, and a good deal of generalization as to what should be done to put Australia right. When asked for details of their proposals, honorable senators opposite have always evaded the point. This is natural in view of the fact that, until recently, a government supported by them was in charge of the destinies of the Commonwealth for a lengthy period. The Bruce-Page administration was primarily responsible for the difficulties which now confront us. It has been said that governments, Commonwealth and State, as well as private individuals, have been living beyond their means. I believe this is true. But these difficulties did not begin in October last, when the present Government came into office. As the right honorable the Prime </para>

Although frequent references have been made by honorable senators opposite to reduced costs of production, they have been unable to submit a formula- </para>

              <para>- At present I am dealing with the policy which has been more or less defined by the honorable senator and his colleagues. Later I shall come to the policy that we advocate, when I shall have something to say upon that point. The late Government made a sweeping attempt to dispense with arbitration machinery which has been laboriously built up over a period of years in order to secure reasonable wages and decent living conditions for the workers. The result of the appeal to the people is to be found in the increased numbers in another place of those opposed to the late Government's proposals. </para>

              <para>- The workers were not running from one court to another. They continued their work while their representatives presented their case before a suitable tribunal. The silence of honorable senators opposite suggests, that they have either no solution of this problem which they can disclose at present, or that it is the one which we have suggested, and which they have indignantly denied. What are the difficulties with which Australia is confronted to-day? Our present economic position is due to the fact that for many years we have been living beyond our means. We have been purchasing goods overseas to a greater extent than we have been selling to our customers abroad. The solution of the difficulty which was available to the late Government at any period of its existence is to import less and to export more. This Government has already taken steps in that direction. </para>

              <para>- I shall deal with that point shortly. I do not wish my remarks to be misunderstood. I am not condemning Australian manufacturers, their industries, or their workmen, as I believe that the growth of Australia's manufacturing industries during the past two decades compares more than favorably with the development of similar industries in other civilized countries. Our manufacturers cannot successfully compete with those in close touch with the big centres of population, where extensive markets exist, until we have a much larger population. The exports from many countries represent surplus production, which is usually dumped, and any price is a good price. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>For increased exports we must look to the primary industries, such as wool-growing, dairying, and wheat-growing in order to secure any immediate improvement in the position. Our pastoralists have gone through periods of adversity owing to unsatisfactory climatic conditions as a result of which their flocks have been seriously depleted. They are also feeling the effects of reduced prices for wool ; but the Government may be able to do something to improve their prospects in the future. Some years must elapse before our flocks are restored and our wool production is increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> referred to loss which the wool industry would suffer if prices reached too high a level, because of the restricted use of wool, and also to the disability experienced by the pastoralists in consequence of the price of wool falling below the cost of production. The honorable senator alluded to the conditions which prevailed during the war, when wool was marketed at a flat rate of ls. 3d. per lb., and when the wool-growers later discovered that a fairy godmother, in the shape of B.A.W.R.A. had a very substantial sum to distribute, which gave the growers a much higher price than they anticipated. The regulated price referred to, and which the honorable senator said was desirable in the interests of the industry, was obtained as the result of a co-operative  marketing system. Those engaged in the wool industry should seriously consider whether it is not better to organize and secure some form of co-operative marketing than be forced to do so if the economic position of the industry becomes worse than it is to-day. I trust that some such system in connexion with this industry, in which I have some interest, will be introduced. The only way for the growers to secure better prices is to adopt some system of pooling or co-operative marketing. The dairying industry in Australia is capable of considerable expansion, not so much by bringing new areas under production, as by the application of scientific methods, and by improving the standard of our dairy herds.  </para>
          <para>Any Government would be justified in offering assistance and amply repaid for any help given dairy farmers to improve their herds or to apply more scientific methods to their production. When one travels through the various dairying districts of Australia and notices the ' remarkable disparity between the production of different farms in the same locality where the natural conditions are practically the same, one is struck with the enormous possibilities for improvement that exist in that industry. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable senator suggests that the Labour party is always willing to work the primary producer almost to death and to exempt the wage-earner from the necessity to work at all. The Labour party has done considerably more to improve the position of the primary producers of this country than has the party which the right honorable senator leads in the Senate. If evidence of that fact, is sought, it can be seen in the number of rural constituencies which are permanently represented by Labour men in our Parliaments. </para>

              <para>- I am not aware that any one has advocated 40 hours a week for dairy farmers. Theirs is a peculiar industry which demands attention both morning and evening, although in the middle of the day there is a considerable period during which the dairy farmer is comparatively free. </para>

              <para>- I have had as much practical personal experience of dairying as most honorable senators opposite have had. I know the great disadvantages associated with the industry. I am aware that "Daisy" requires attention regularly both morning and evening, and that therefore, dairy-farmers are more tied to their work than are other primary producers. But is his position any worse than that of the wage-earner who has to be at his job each morning when the whistle blows, and must remain there until it blows again at night? Moreover, the wage-earner is virtually on the job when he is travelling between his home and his place of employment. It is true that his actual hours of employment in the factory or workshop may be only eight or eight and three-quarter hours each day, but actually, his work makes much greater demands on his time than that. If the time taken by the dairy farmer in doing odd jobs around his farm is to be taken into consideration in determining the number of hours he works, then the time spent by the wage-earner in travelling to and from his work must also be counted. </para>

              <para>- Some of them have. In South Australia the Country party desires a system of pooling; yet when a Labour Government proposes to establish a wheat pool the proposal is damned with faint praise by some honorable senators. Some of the opponents of the scheme are not prepared to condemn the policy altogether; they merely reserve judgment. But running through their remarks is a veiled opposition to the principle of a compulsory wheat pool. Again, the Government has been criticized for sending out what has been described as an S.O.S. signal to the wheat-growers of Australia to assist the nation in its time of trouble. The farmers are not the only persons to whom an appeal has been addressed. It is true that the manufacturers have been granted additional protection under the tariff, but they have also been told in definite terms that if they do not immediately get on with the task of producing commodities for the use of the people of Australia that protection will be withdrawn. Moreover, they have been told that exploitation of the people of Australia will not be permitted. </para>

              <para>- Probably that is because " Hope springs eternal in the human breast," and they think that before long the right honorable senator and those sitting with him will return to this side of the chamber, and will wink the other eye at the exploitation of the people. The Government has endeavoured to dissuade all sections of the community from purchasing luxuries produced outside Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that the wheat-growers are not the only people who have been asked to assist their country. And they have been offered some encouragement to respond to the appeal - a guarantee of 4s. a bushel f.o.b. for their wheat. </para>

The Government will bear the cost of transporting the wheat from the outport to the port from which it is exported. That is the same as my statement that the price would be 4s. a bushel f.o.b., which raised such a storm of protest from honorable senators opposite that I was reminded of the old proverb, " A little learning is a dangerous thing." </para>

              <para>- I shall not attempt' at this stage to explain the details of the scheme. The Government will guarantee 4s. a bushel at the siding. That can mean only that the farmer will get at least 4s. for every bushel which he delivers there. There is no equivocation about the Government's guarantee. The cost of transport must be borne by some one. If the wheat does not realize a price sufficiently above the guarantee of 4s. a bushel to pay the cost of transport, the Government will have to pay the difference; on the other hand, if the wheat realizes more than sufficient to pay the cost of transport as well as the guaranteed price, the cost of transport will be paid by the pool', and the farmer will benefit by the higher net price. </para>

              <para>- I am glad of the right honorable senator's interjection, because it reminds me of a matter with which I shall deal presently. We have heard a good deal about tH«* efficient wheat marketing methods in operation in Australia, and have been advised to leave well alone. It has been said that the Australian wheat-farmer has at his disposal the most efficient marketing system in the world. My experience of Australian farmers, particularly in South Australia, is that they have never been satisfied with the methods under which their wheat has been marketed. In the early days 'of wheat-growing in that State, their dissatisfaction was so great that they formed their own co-operative organization to handle their wheat. Unfortunately, it was not so successful as some of its sponsors hoped it would be. In 1907, as the result of reports made to the State Parliament about exploitation in connexion with the marketing of wheat, the then Government - a coalition of the democratic and Labour parties, and virtually a Labour government - appointed a royal commission of inquiry, under the chairmanship the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> H. Coombe, M.P. That commission exhaustively investigated the allegation, and found that a ring of wheat-buyers operated in South Australia which fixed prices and did all that it could to stifle competition. The commission found that the existence of that ring was detrimental to the wheat-growers of the State. It found, further, that when the Govern-' ment reduced the freight on wheat in order to confer a benefit on the wheat-growers - a concession which amounted to approximately £37,000 for the year - the wheat merchants pocketed that benefit and did not pass one penny on to the farmers. Exploitation of the farmers was conclusively proved. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>So the agitation for improved marketing facilities began. During the war a compulsory wheat pool was formed, similar to that which governed the export of wool. No doubt honorable senators opposite will say that that was due to the national exigencies of the moment. Despite the fact that those pools had to operate under great natural and national disadvantages, and that, in some cases, they were hampered by being controlled by Ministers who were not altogether sympathetic to the principles, they were, by and large, a magnificent success. They saved the wheat-growers of Australia from the difficulties then associated with marketing their products, and helped to keep the industry stable during one of the most calamitous times in the history of the nation and of that industry. Following the discontinuance of the compulsory pools of the war period, there were created the voluntary pools that are now operating.. </para>
          <para>These pools have been subjected to a good deal of criticism. The Wheat Merchants Association has circularized honorable senators opposite with figures intended to be used as an argument against any endeavour to establish a compulsory wheat pool. They seek to prove that the prices paid by the merchants for wheat has been higher than that paid by voluntary pools. But no accurate data can be secured to prove that contention. It is well known what price the voluntary pool obtains for its members; but in examining the prices paid by the Wheat Merchants Association it is necessary to ascertain the quantity of wheat sold at both the maximum and minimum prices. It has been stated that, in certain years, the merchants paid 5s. 2d. and 5s. 3d. a bushel. It is known that during the same period, they also paid "4s. 2d. and 4s. 3d. a bushel for wheat. It is impossible to assess the fair average price paid withoutknowingthequantiti.es purchased at the maximum and minimum prices. </para>
          <para>The South Australian voluntary wheat pool has given satisfaction to its farmer members. That can easily be proved. Only a very small percentage of the farmers seceded from the pool when the time came for the cancellation of the contracts, due to the expiration of the agreement, despite the quantity of propaganda that was disseminated amongst them by the Wheat Merchants Association. That association even went so far as to offer legal assistance to the farmers to enable them successfully to repudiate their contracts with the pool. Does that not indicate that the system gave these men a fair deal, and that they were satisfied with the arrangement? I believe that the present percentage participating in pooling in South Australia is the highest attained since the institution of the voluntary pooling system. </para>
          <para>The matter may be summed up in this way: If pooling is not going to be beneficial to the farmers, and will not deprive the merchants of some of the profits they are now making, why are those merchants so concerned about the proposal? Why did they, two years ago, circularize all of the wheat-farmers of South Australia seeking to induce them to withdraw from the voluntary pools? Why did they recently go to the expense of circularizing honorable members of this and another chamber in an effort to induce them to use their influence with the Government to stay its hand in the establishment of a compulsory pool? It is patent that they have something to lose, and that the introduction of a properly organized pooling system is in the interests of the farmers. We are told that, from the stand-point of the taxpayer, the guaranteeing of 4s. a bushel is a risky procedure. I have some figures prepared by the South Australian Government Statistician, which give the average price of wheat over a long period of years. They are very illuminating, and I propose to quote them so that they may be embodied in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> for the future information of honorable senators. <inline font-style="italic">Silting suspended from 6.

              <para>- Approximately it would be that. It must be remembered that for the greater portion of those 67 years prices all the world over were considerably lower than they are to-day. There may be danger in fixing a price on present values which, compared with world prices over a long period of years, are rather phenomenal and not altogether comparable, but the prices over the period of 67 years covered by the table I have quoted indicate a fair margin of safety in fixing the price of wheat at 4s. at the railway siding, or 4s. 8d. to cover transport and other charges. </para>

          <para>We have heard a great deal from honorable senators about the world's wheat production, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has referred to the parlous condition of the wheat industry, but I do not think there is sufficient data available for any one to express the definite opinio"n that in the near future there will be a considerable surplus of production which will prejudice the price of wheat produced in Australia or elsewhere. Whilst the world's production of wheat to-day is not very much greater than it was in pre-war years, the world's consumption of wheat is annually increasing at a very rapid rate. I do not know the average consumption of wheat per head of the population in wheat-consuming countries, but Australia requires five bushels a head for local consumption, and that does not take into account the requirements for seed, or other purposes. Since the war many countries have begun to consume wheaten bread instead of bread made from other classes of cereal or in place of other forms of foodstuffs in use prior to the war, and on this account the consumption of wheat the world over is increasing. There will, therefore, be no danger of a great increase in the world's wheat production leading to a collapse of the market because of over-production. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has expressed misgivings as to what may occur if Russia comes into the market again, and has said that it will probably flood the market in the very near future. I find it difficult to understand the vagaries of some honorable senators opposite. One day they would have us believe that Russia under its present form of government is nothing better than a disorganized rabble, that its industries are going from bad to worse, that its people are on the verge of starvation, and that the country is rapidly heading for national bankruptcy. </para>

            <para>- The records do not bear out the statement of honorable senators opposite that Russia is rapidly heading towards national bankruptcy, nor do they bear out the assertion just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> Figures prepared by the International Bureau of Agriculture in Rome, covering the last twenty years, and therefore covering a period prior to the war and prior to the revolution in Russia show that the wheat production of Russia to-day is greater than it was prior to the war and prior to the revolution. The average for the four years from 1909 to 1913, pre-war and pre-revolution years, was 757,000,000 bushels. In 1924 the production dropped to 472,000,000 bushels, but there was a remarkable recovery in the next year, when the production was 730,000,000 bushels. In 1926 it amounted to 819,000,000 bushels. It fell the following year to 749,000,000 bushels, but in 1928 rose to 856,000,000 bushels, and the estimated yield for 1929 was 920,000,000 bushels. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> I thank honorable senators. The actual yield and the estimated, wheat yield of Russia for the last two years are considerably higher than the average yield for the pre-war years from 1909 to 1913. </para>

Will the honorable senator say that a return issued by a standard bureau, such as the International Bureau of Agriculture in Rome, is not more reliable than sundry statements published from time to time and gathered from unauthorized and unauthentic sources? Personally, I should prefer to accept the figures compiled by the Bureau of .Agriculture, Rome. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not. All I am saying is that if the people of Russia consumed as much wheat as the people of Australia do, Russia would have to produce an additional 270,000,000 bushels per annum. It is a fact that Russia is organizing its agricultural industries, and is rapidly extending the acreage cropped. The estimates for the coming harvest indicate that production will be well over the 1,000,000,000 bushel mark. From this it would appear that Russia, like Australia, is concentrating on the production of a commodity which she can readily dispose of for her own benefit. But my main point is that, with the increased consumption of wheat, not only in Russia, but in eastern countries, where formerly wheat has not been extensively used, there is a hopeful future for wheat production in Australia for at least some years to come. </para>

If honorable senators will study the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> they will find that the average production in Russia is amongst the lowest of the principal wheat-producing countries of the world, being in the neighbourhood of 10 or 11 bushels per acre over a period of several years. It is obvious that as cultivation extends the wheat-growers there will be forced to open up country at. a greater distance from the seaboard. Consequently their transport difficulties will increase. In this respect, the primary producers of Australia enjoy . a marked advantage over those of other countries. The bulk of our wheat-producing territory is situated around our coastline. Comparatively little wheat is grown over 150 miles from any terminal port of shipment whereas wheat producers in the United States of America, Canada, and Russia, have to pay transport charges over long haulages to the port of shipment, and are thus at a disadvantage compared with the majority of wheat-growers in Australia. </para><para>I am one of those who have an abundant faith in the future of thi3 country. It will be .a sorry day for the Commonwealth if, for the purpose of putting our house in order, we acquiesce in a proposal to reduce the present wages standard of the working classes. Our uniformly high wages standard has been of immense benefit to our primary producers because it has given them a wider home market for their products. To overcome our economic difficulties, we should begin at the top. That is what this Government is doing. It is curtailing expenditure of the Commonwealth Parliament as far as possible. It has made substantial savings during the current financial year. I am confident that these savings will increase in volume from year to year.  This policy will have to be continued so as to make possible a general reduction in the burden of interest and rent, and gradually work down the scale until the cost of living can be reduced without inflicting hardships upon the working classes. </para><interjection>

          </continue><para>I believe that the difficulties which are confronting us are already in process of adjustment. There has been a fall in land values in South Australia during the last two years, and I have no doubt that the same influences are at work in the other States. This is a healthy sign, and it must confer substantial benefits upon primary producers throughout the Commonwealth, because during the boom period of a few years ago, land values were at a level which could not be justified by the productive capacity of the land. As values gradually come back to the productive level, all those engaged in the task of producing wealth from the soil will have a better opportunity to succeed. With the elimination of the speculators, land values and house properties are gradually declining, and in the course of time there will be a levelling down in rents. It may be possible for this Government to take certain steps to facilitate this process, though at the moment I do not know that there is anything of a practical nature which can be done. The State Governments may do things which the Commonwealth cannot do, but the federal administration may be able to help. After we get over our present difficulties, it may be possible for the Commonwealth to assist State banks and other institutions which provide houses for the people on long-dated loans to meet the demand for homes, and in that way reduce competition for properties available. </para><interjection>

The party to which I belong believes that the best interests of the Australian nation can be served by the well ordered development of this country, and by the equal distribution of the proceeds derived from the application of labour to the soil. We know that there is no royal road to prosperity, and that we have to make our cake before we can eat it. Surely we are entitled to ask that the workers shall not be asked to produce a cake for someone else to consume. All we ask is that those who produce the wealth of this country, and to whom we must look for its future prosperity and expansion, shall be given a fair deal. On that declaration we are prepared to allow our policy to rest in the belief that this Government will act in such a way that Australia and its people will prosper as a result of its administration. </para>

I trust honorable senators will not run away with the idea that I am obsessed with the subject of defence, and that I am unduly- fearful ; but I do not think that many members of this Parliament realize the gravity of the situation. I am certain that the people as a whole have not the faintest realization of the defenceless position of the Commonwealth. This important subject is mentioned very briefly in the ministerial Statement - </para>

          <para class="block">That is a pious aspiration, and may sound all right. What is meant by " effecting economies consistent with efficiency"? If the proposals of' the Government embodied economies consistent with efficiency I should have no objection to offer. One of the principal reasons which influenced the Australian people in agreeing to federation was that a federal system would provide a uniform and systematic defence for the Commonwealth, and that our safety would not be dependent upon six varying State systems. Australia to-day, as always, is an extreme outpost of the British race. To-day the great question to be settled by all Australians is : Are we prepared to defend our country? Should our ways of living, our language, our traditions, our standard of economic conditions, our political institutions, be threatened by foreigners? Do we propose to rely on the British Navy, to paper agreements, to chance, to our isolation, as the sole basis on which our right to live our lives in our own way is to depend ? </para>
          <para>This is the paramount problem confronting Australia to-day, and the nation that is not prepared to make the necessary sacrifice in training its manhood is moribund - it is not a nation. By its hurried and ill-timed action in abolishing compulsory citizen service the Government has rendered a disservice to the Commonwealth as time alone will show. We are running a fearful risk. The proposal of the Government is to establish a force number- ing 35,000 officers and men under a voluntary system of enlistment. Even supposing that tha.t number could be raised it would be quite inadequate. Australia's defence is, in the first place, a technical and financial problem, and, secondly, it is a question of the willingness of the people to make sacrifices in the way of personal service, which will fit them for the work which may have to be done. The dreadful apathy of the people in this connexion, is a sinister feature of our national life. It is regrettable that the people cannot be roused to a sense of their duty in this matter. If Australia should be threatened with invasion would the people as a whole be prepared to face the dangers, horrors and privations of repelling their aggressors by force? In my opinion, a great proportion of our people would not, unless under compulsion, be willing to do so. There will always be a certain number of proud, fearless, truly independent spirits willing to make the supreme sacrifice for their country. There will always be a spineless class incapable of sacrifice or effort. Between these two lies the mass of the people. But the real strength of any nation or people in the last analysis lies in the willingness of these to use force to repel aggression. Reluctantly I am compelled to the conclusion' that there has been a great shrinkage of this willingness since the cessation of hostilities in 1918. Even supposing the necessary arms were available, they would be of little use unless we had men trained to use them. During recent months, military training has been practically ^abandoned. It is our proud boast - indeed, it is almost an article of our faith - that Australia shall be preserved to the white races. No one can deny our right to a policy of the exclusion of coloured peoples. But let no man or woman in this country be deceived into the belief that it will go unchallenged. The day will come - how soon no one knows - when a world court will decide whether that policy is, or is not, justified. Then will our White Australia pass away, unless we have made ready and are able to successfully defend, by force of arms, our right to this policy. </para>

              <para>- I shall deal with that presently. Australia is set in the Pacific Ocean, isolated from other portions of the Empire, its people, not only unarmed and unready to defend themselves, but actually making no practical effort to defend their much vaunted freedom. Twenty . years ago, public opinion was healthy on the vital matter of defence. At that time all sections of the community, irrespective of class or creed, joined in adopting a system of defence based largely on the Swiss compulsory citizen military training system. That system was truly democratic, and it passes my comprehension that any Government should seek to wipe it out. If we compare a voluntary system of defence with a compulsory military training system we can come to only one conclusion as to which is the more effective. In practice, voluntary systems rarely prove effective. It would be as reasonable to introduce a voluntary system of taxation as to have a voluntary system of defence. In this connexion it is well to point out that a compulsory military training system is no intrusion on the liberty of the subject. John Stuart Mill in the first chapter of <inline font-style="italic">On Liberty</inline> specifies that military service is something which a civilized state has a right to demand from every citizen. It is contended in some quarters that compulsory military service is alien, to Anglo-Saxon traditions. As one who has studied military history, I say that that contention is quite fallacious. The foundations of modern England were laid between 1300 and 1660 during- which period the country's military forces were on a compulsory basis. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

          <para class="block">Honorable senators have before them a memorandum showing the alterations proposed to be made to the principal act, so that it is not necessary for me to refer to them in detail at this stage. The purpose of the bill is so to amend the existing law as to state in clear and unequivocal terms the intention of the framers of the original act. This course is necessary because of recent judgments by the High Court in two cases, to which I shall refer later. In asking the Senate to make these amendments because of decisions of the High Court I am not suggesting that this Parliament exists for the purpose of over-riding the High Court. That body has been set up to interpret the law. If the framers of the law express their intention in words which the High Court feels are not capable of the meaning which the framers intended, the court nevertheless declares what it considers their meaning to be. That is the position in the case before us. The framers of the original act intended that the definition in the act should be wide enough to cover the very cases dealt with by the High Court. The High Court held that the words used conveyed an entirely different meaning. Unless this Parliament is prepared to take the responsibility of giving a definition of "unimproved value," which, while expressing the will of Parliament, will exclude the possibility of further appeals, as well as stop appeals which are now pending, the return of some hundreds of thousands of pounds to taxpayers might be involved. </para>
          <para>By the Federal Land Tax Assessment Act 1910 " unimproved value " in relation to land is defined as meaning the capital  sum which the fee-simple might be expected to realize, assuming that the improvements, if any, thereon, or appertaining thereto, and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made. It had been recognized as long ago as Morrison's case, that the questions involved in this definition were : "What would be the value of 'the land if it had continued in a state of nature " - the unimproved value - " and what is its value now" - the improved value ? 'But until Toohey's case it had been universally assumed that a legitimate method of ascertaining the unimproved value of improved land was to ascertain the improved value and to deduct therefrom the value of the existing improvements. The way in which this method was worked out was, first to determine the improved value. It was then ordinarily ascertained what had been the condition of the land in its wild state. Everything' which had since been done to it which was still effective to give it, or to help to give it, its present improved condition was regarded as au improvement. The value of these improvements was determined by ascertaining what it would cost to carry them out at the date of valuation, the relevant 30th June. The amount so arrived at was adjusted. If the actual improvement was not new, a deduction was made for depreciation. If the effecting of the improvement involved the keeping idle of capital until the la,nd became productive as improved land, an addition was made for interest lost on outlay. If the improvement had existed for some time, and, by reason of its special nature, had an enhanced value on this account, an addition was made for this. The value of the improvements, ascertained and adjusted in this way, was deducted from the improved value; and the difference was taken as the unimproved value. It was recognized that the matter might be approached directly, by considering the land ns it was in its original wild state, and determining what it would now be worth in that state. The question was sometimes dealt with in that way, when there was still in existence comparable land in a wild state, which had been recently sold, so that evidence of its value was available. But such evidence was rarely available, and when it was, it was not necessarily sufficient to establish a standard of value. From this decision a system of assessing the particular value upon which taxation had to be paid grew up. That system continued for years until, probably as the result of the Toohey case, some taxpayer decided that the time was ripe for a test case. Probably the change in the personnel of the High Court was a further encouragement to do so. The test case was that of  McGeoch,  the judgment in which related to the application of the definition of " unimproved value." The court upheld the ' appellant's contention that the present wording of the definition of " unimproved value " when being applied to an improved property required the Commissioner to ascertain the value at which a sale could be made of the land if it were in that condition in which it would probably have been at the date of sale if it had never been improved. The appellant's land in question was situated in an area thickly infested with prickly pear, but was not itself infested with the pest. In order to prevent infestation, the  apellant  adopted certain modes of cultivation and claimed that because he did so he had effected an improvement, the cost of which could be deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the amount that he should be charged for land tax. The High Court held that as the appellant's land was situated in' an area thickly infested with prickly pear and had been kept free from infestation only by the annual expenditure of money, it had to be assumed that if the improvements on the land had never been made it also would have been thickly infested with pear. In that condition, of course, its selling value would have been negligible. The Court declined to pay any regard to the fact that the appellant, when purchasing the land a few years previously from the owner, who lad kept it free from pear, had fixed his purchase price having regard to the necessity to expend an amount annually in order to eradicate any new plants which might have begun to grow. The department, up to that time, had acted upon the rulings previously laid down by the High Court in several judgments, that the unimproved value of an improved piece of land could properly be deduced from its improved selling value by deducting from the improved selling value the value of the existing improvements on or appertaining to the land. That practice had been followed by the department ever since the Land Tax Act was introduced in December, 1910, and it had not previously been challenged by any taxpayer. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator has appreciated the point. I think honorable senators will agree that the practice followed by the department was certainly in conformity with the intention of the framers of the act, although it may not have been expressed in the language of the statute. The department says that so far as what is termed " improved " land is concerned, anything clone to prevent it depreciating in value is not an improvement for which a deduction could be made, but anything that is done which adds to the value of the virgin soil is an improvement in respect of which a deduction could be made. The block with which we are dealing was in an area infested with prickly pear. If precautions had not been taken the land would have deteriorated by becoming infested with the pest. In the circumstances the department contended that the owner was not entitled to make a deduction for that expenditure. </para>

              <para>- As honorable senators will see there is an express provision dealing with fencing. The Government admits that there must be some limitation, but that matter will be more fully dealt with when we go into committee. Following its usual practice when dealing with the McGeoch case, the department took the price which the appellant had given for the land, as representing the fair market value of the property as it stood. Seeing that that price had already made allowance for the annual outlay necessary to keep the land free from prickly pear, the department merely deducted from the sale price the value of the structural and other improvements, including the cost of clearing the timber which had originally grown on the laud. The court rejected that practice, although it was one previously sanctioned by several judgments of the High Court. </para>

          <para>Honorable senators will realize that the latest judgment of the High Court is applicable not only to what may be termed " prickly pear land " but also to lands situated in parts of Australia where other vegetable and animal pests abound and would over-run land if not kept in check. Take, for example, St. John's wort. That pest is gaining ground in the Clare district of South Australia. When a farmer takes every precaution to keep his land up to high standard by preventing the intrusion of St. John's wort, that expenditure is not a permissible deduction for taxation purposes. </para>

If he desires, it, I shall quote an opinion from the junior and senior counsel in this case, who had no axe to grind, and who advised the Government as to the exact language of the amendment which should be introduced. In considering this matter, honorable senators must take into account the operation of the present system of land taxation and its possible effects in connexion with taxation affecting the eradication of vegetable and other pests. There should be no necessity for me to point out that, if the present position were allowed to continue, it would involve the Government in a very heavy loss of revenue, because a large percentage, of country lands would cease to be taxable, as their unimproved value would be either nothing at all or so low as to be outside the scope of the tax. </para>

          <para>I submit that it is clear that that result was never intended by Parliament when the measure was originally passed.

An eminent judge like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs disagreed with his brothers of the High Court Bench, and contended that even with the definition as it stood the department was entitled to adopt the policy which it had adopted. But the majority of the High Court decides what the law is, and whilst that judgment stands and the- definition is in its present form the practice followed by the Taxation Department has to be altered, so as to bring it into line with the McGeoch case. </para>

              <para>- I do hot, because all these cases have to be decided on a certain set of facts. But I do say that a practice which had been built up by previous taxation decisions was held in that case to be. in error. Honorable senators will realize that that practice has been in vogue since the origination of the Land Tax Act in 1910, under the jurisdiction of different governments occupying the treasury benches. Taxpayers have received their taxation assessments, and those principles were followed. It is for this Senate to decide whether Parliament, if it believes in the principle of a land tax, is going to impose one that is just and equitable. If a certain amount of revenue has to be raised by the country in the form of land tax, and Parliament reduces the number of taxpayers, it stands to reason that those who are left have to pay a higher proportion of the taxation. I ask honorable senators seriously to consider how far-reaching will be the position if the statutory position remains unaltered. It will result in an immediate loss of revenue, so far as the Government is' concerned, and the possibility of increased taxation so far as the remaining taxpayers are concerned. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. However, it is not a final test ; but merely an appropriate starting point. The alternative method will be to ascertain the unimproved value of the improved property by first ascertaining its improved selling value in the light of all disabilities and all liabilities to which it may be subject, and deducting therefrom the present-day cost of making the existing improvements on the land, that cost being adjusted so as to make reasonable provision for any depreciation which may have taken place in the physical condition of the improvements compared with a new condition. </para>

Supposing I had walked into the honorable senator's land in 1929 and noticed the conditions of the pasture were such that the land could not suitably carry one sheep to the acre; but in the following year, through top dressing and planting of subterranean clover, that capacity was made possible, the improvements would be visible. An allowance is made for the improvement when the land is re-assessed. </para>

              <para>- If the land tax valuer applies that principle the taxpayer has the right of appeal. But we are not now dealing with the administrative act of a particular officer. We are dealing with principles, and I. hope honorable senators will confine the discussion within that ambit. The principle immediately at issue is whether we are to allow a definition to stand which will tack on to the exempted portion something which is done to prevent depreciation, or whether we are to adhere to the System which has been in operation ever since the land tax has been imposed in the Commonwealth, that of ascertaining first of all the improved value and then the cost of bringing the land to that value and subsequently arriving at the unimproved value by a reference to the matters to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>The new definition of unimproved land value proposed in the bill has been the subject of a conference between the departmental officers and counsel who represented the Commissioner before the High Court in the recent appeal, and it is considered that it would completely and effectively overcome the judgment of the High Court and restore the practice previously followed by the court and the department. The question is whether the Senate will stand by this particular practice. While the High Court decision remains, and the legislation is unaltered, it is impossible for the Taxation Department to carry into effect the express will of the legislature. If on the other hand Parliament says that the list of taxpayers liable to pay land tax should be further limited, and that this particular class should be, if not in theory, at least in practice, excluded from taxation, the Treasurer will have to find some other means of meeting the loss of revenue, which I am advised runs into something over £300,000. All that the Government can do is to point out the interpretation placed on the law by the High Court and indicate what the consequences of that interpretation are. If Parliament is not prepared to alter the law, it must accept the responsibility. The Government can simply urge the consideration of its request that the law be amended. </para>

              <para>- I should say it would be an improvement if it were a matter of keeping on for a couple of years until all the suckers were killed, and I am instructed that it is allowed for at the present time by the Taxation Department. It is certainly a border-line case when it is a question of cutting suckers in order to grow wheat. The work of converting semi-forest or mallee lands into wheat-growing lands is different from that which is done by the man who fears the spread of St. John's wort on to his property from an adjoining holding. He takes precautions to prevent a noxious weed from causing a set of circumstances which would bring about depreciation in the value of his holding. </para>

          <para>I come now to the second portion of the amending bill. The provision sought to be amended is sub-section 3 of section 28 of the principal act. The Northampton Pastoral Company's case has shown, the need for the alteration. It raised the question whether the present terms of sub-section 3 of section 28 imposed the liability to pay land tax on leases from the Crown where a lease is subject to resumption of the whole or part of the land or where the rent for the lease is subject to  reappraisement  during the term of the lease. The court held that the present terms of the sub-section do not impose a liability to pay land tax on leases from the Crown where the lease is subject to resumption of the whole or part of the land, or where the rent from the lease is subject to  reappraisement  during the term of the lease. The court's reasons for this decision were that the words of the existing law can only refer to leases where the period for which the lease is granted applies to the whole of the land covered by the lease and where a definite rental for the whole of the period of the lease is reserved by the lease. It is another illustration of the methods of this body which has been set up to interpret the law. The court does not say what the law should be or indicate other words that might have been used for the purpose of conveying the true intention of Parliament. It simply says that the words used do not refer to the class of lease at the moment under consideration. The court pointed out that if the land or any part of it is subject to resumption upon the expiration of a specified period which is less than the period of the lease, it cannot be said that a lease in that land or part of the land exists for the full period specified in the lease, and where rent reserved by a lease is subject to reappraisement during the currency of the lease, it cannot be said that the annual rent for the unexpired period of the lease is ascertainable for purposes of the calculations required by the act. </para>
          <para>If honorable senators will look at the memorandum which has been circulated they will see the effect that judgment will have if no alteration is made to the act. It will release from taxation another class df taxpayers, and the result will be that the taxation not collectable from them will have to be made up by other classes of land taxpayers. The judgment in the Northampton Pastoral Company's case is applicable also to all kinds of leases, whether they are leases of Crown lands or of privately-owned lands, where the terms of the lease expose it to a resumption of the whole or part of the land or to reappraisement of the rent during the currency of the lease, thus adding to the num'ber of classes already exempted. </para>

          <para class="block">The two first-mentioned types of lease were specified in the original Land Tax Assessment Act. The third class was not specified in the law until the passing of the 1914 Amending Act. There are some private leases which have been granted for definite periods at a rental fixed for part of that period subject to alteration for the remainder of the period of the lease. These are leases where the rent is subject to reappraisement, and in the light of the judgment of the court in the Northampton Pastoral Company's case, would be exempt from land tax. Conditional leases or leases with right of purchase from the Crown and perpetual leases from the Crown without revaluation, which means, without reappraisement of rent, are, in some cases, subject to resumption of part of  the  land. Therefore those particular leases would not be taxable in the light of the judgment of the High Court referred to. It is clear from the wording of the statute, and from the scheme that was evolved, that it was the intention of Parliament that this class of lessee should be taxed. Once we admitted the principle that a Crown lessee should be subject to land taxation, on what principle could we exempt the man whose land might contain a condition providing for reappraisement? Once Parliament admitted the principle of the taxation of Crown leases, it intended to cover all Crown leases. Unfortunately, it used language which, the High Court held, does not convey the meaning that the Government says should be attributed to it; therefore, we are asking the Parliament to amend the law accordingly. The amending bill has been designed to cause the original intention of Parliament to be effective not only for future assessments, but also for all past years, but without depriving those taxpayers who have been successful in their appeals to the court from the benefits of any judgment they may have obtained before the passing of the bill as an act. </para>
          <para>If the judgment of the court were applied for all past years in all cases in which assessments include leases where the land is subject to resumption wholly or in part, or where the rent reserved by the lease is subject to re-appraisement, the Commonwealth would be obliged to refund over £1,100,000. </para>

          <para>SenatorDALY. - I suppose that if I had said, when the original measure was passing through Parliament, that it did not cover those classes of leases, the Leader of the Opposition, who was then a Minister, would have replied to me in no uncertain language - "You know that is not true. I have a legal opinion here which clearly states that the definition in the bill will cover all classes of Crown leases." Now he tells us that there is no legal liability. When I was in practice at the barI gave what, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> will agree, was good advice, " Avoid litigation if possible." There is not much satisfaction in knowing at. the conclusion of a case that a mistake has been made in the interpretation of the law. The Government desires to remove even the possibility of a claim for £1,100,000 if Parliament is satisfied with the principle that once Crown leases are to be taxed the whole of them should be taxed. </para>

              <para>- No; that is not a function of the Parliament. To the lay mind it may be a distinction without a difference, but there is a big difference from the legal point of view. We are not attempting to undo anything which the High Court has done. We are not attempting to evade any obligation imposed on us by the court, or by reason of a threat of proceedings. The court did not hold that the principle of the taxation of Crown leases was wrong. It said. "If Parliament intended to cover all classes of leases, then the words by which it gave expression to its intention do  not convey that meaning. Therefore, as we are here to interpret the law within the four corners of this act - not to be guided by what Parliament might have said, but by what it has said - -we find that all classes of leases are not covered." In view of that interpretation, the Government is attempting to make the law clear, so that no claims can be lodged against the Government, and so that there will not be even the possibility of a claim for this £1,100,000. This sum exceeds the total land tax which has been assessed for all years in respect of those Crown leases which were included in the Land Tax Assessment Act by the 1914 amendment, because it includes land tax assessed on some conditional leases or leases with right of purchase and perpetual leases without re-valuation, which were specified in the original Land Tax Assessment Act, 1910. The amount does not take into consideration the tax paid on private leases where rents have been subject to alteration during the currency of the lease. The sum I have mentioned relates only to Crown, leases; but there is the private lease for a period of years under which re-appraisement is provided for, and all these lessees have a claim against the Government. </para>

              <para>- I am inviting the Senate to guard against even possible legal or moral claims. The Government is anxious to amend the law to make it conform to the intentions of its framers. If we remove the possibility of these claims we shall do no injury to anybody, except those persons who might feel inclined to earn a decent living in testing the matter before the High Court. That is the reason why the bill provides for retrospective operation for all assessments back to and including those for 1914-15. This will cover all assessments of Crown leases without right of purchase for agricultural, pastoral, or grazing purposes, and homestead, mining and timber leases which Parliament sought to make taxable in and after that year. Those particular leases ceased to be taxable after the 1922-23 assessment. The past assessments of the remaining types of lease previously described will also be validated, and statutory authority will exist for the inclusion of those types of lease in future assessments. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I now come to what I suppose will be a contentious point. I stated erroneously that the- Government was not asking in this bill for the inclusion of another class of taxpayer. We are, but I am sure it is a class on whom, no hardship will be inflicted. Honorable senators will note that there is a provision by which the exemption from land tax previously allowed in respect of golf links is to be withdrawn. The Government considers that there is not sufficient justification for the continuation of the exemption of golf clubs. These are exclusive bodies. They are not public, in character like football or cricket clubs, membership of which is open to the public. Whilst it is true that golf links are wide open areas, and assist  in maintaining the surrounding atmosphere free from dust, they do not act in that manner to any greater extent than similar areas which are under cultivation or are used for grazing purposes, all of which are subject to land tax. </para>
          <para>It will be observed that the bill contains, in clause <inline font-style="italic">1,</inline> provision for the retrospective application of certain of the proposed amendments. Retrospective operation is necessary for those amendments which are intended to remedy the defects in the existing law which have been disclosed by the two judgments of the High Court already mentioned in order that all past assessments which have been made under the existing law, but, in the light of the judgment, are not in strict conformity with the law, should not be capable of amendment in accordance with the terms of the judgments. The bill specifies that the retrospective operation of any of the amendments made by it shall not apply so as to affect any judgment of the High Court or of a Supreme Court of a State obtained prior to the commencement of the bill as an act- by any person in his favour in respect of an assessment made under the existing law. This saving provision represents the usual practice of the Commonwealth Parliament in connexion with retrospective legislation. For the reasons I have given I invite the Senate to pass this measure. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia)  [9.44.].  - I take it that Parliament, in allowing the land tax to remain on the statute-book, is acquiescing in that form of taxation; but I submit that in tie law itself there are certain limitations. For instance, there is the limitation of a £5,000 exemption, and there is a limitation, too, as to the principles on which the tax shall be levied. There is the principle that it shall be placed on the unimproved value of the land. When this legislation was under consideration a question arose as to how the unimproved value was to be arrived at, and Parliament laid down in the measure how it believed that value should be determined. After it had expressed its will, two other factors operated. In the first place, the Commissioner of Taxation proceeded to give his interpretation of what </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament meant by the words that it had put into the statute. I altogether dissent from the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> that Parliament is bound to accept the interpretation of the Commissioner of Taxation. There is another factor to be considered - the High Court. Parliament deliberately set up the High Court to interpret the law. I do not accept the view that the interpretation of the Commissioner of Taxation necessarily represents the view of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- We did collect, but the interpretation of the Commissioner of Taxation has since been challenged, and the High Court has declared that the intention of Parliament was not correctly interpreted by the department. The Commissioner of Taxation has been doing certain things in accordance with what he believed to be the intention of Parliament. Up to a certain point, his interpretation of the law had not been challenged, but it having been contested in respect of certain assessments, the High Court, to whom the matter was remitted,- declared that the Commissioner's interpretation of the law was wrong. Now the Government, by introducing this bill, is inviting Parliament to over-rule a judgment of the High Court and declare that what the Commissioner has been doing for years interprets the will of Parliament. - </para>

          <para>Two judgments are affected by this measure. One has relation to what is meant by " unimproved value," and what is an " improvement," and the other deals with the taxable value of Crown leases. The two are distinct. Therefore, we have to consider the two principles dealing with these two judgments. Even if Parliament accepts the view of the Government and passes this bill, why should this legislation be made retrospective to  1910  and  1914  respectively? As I understand the law, there is a period during which a taxpayer -may lodge an objection or appeal against the Commissioner's assessment. If he does not avail himself of that provision he loses his right of appeal. </para>

Either he has paid his tax without protest, in which case the matter is dead and cannot be re-opened, or he has not paid, and the tax is still collectable, but the retrospective provisions of the law cannot go back to 1910 or 1914 in either case. Therefore, there can be no argument in favour of making this bill retrospective to those years. If the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> still contends that this legislation should be retrospective, I invite him to consider what may be the position 30 or 40 years hence. If his view is the correct one, and if this legislation must be retrospective to the years mentioned, all future alterations to the act dealing with some new point that may be raised by a High Court judgment must similarly be made retrospective tq 1910 or 1914. But the honorable senator has given no valid reason why the bill should be made retrospective to those  yean. </para>

In any event, the retrospective provision should go back only to the period in which a taxpayer is liable. Obviously, no taxpayer in 1910 or 1914 is to-day liable for taxation in those years. </para>

I am quite sure that if Parliament understood this to be the intention of the department, the bill would have no chance of passing in any shape or form.

I can assure the Leader of the Senate that I have read carefully the speech delivered by the Treasurer in another place. He made a statement similar to that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> this evening, but afterwards he amended it by saying that the sum. of £1,100,000 had already been paid in respect of taxation of these leases, and that there was no legal obligation on the Commonwealth to  refund that amount. This statement makes it clear that there are two amounts in respect of which there could be a claim upon the Commonwealth. One is £160,000, which has been paid under protest, or covered by some letters from the department to the taxpayers concerned, and the other amount is £180,000 which is still outstanding, and which the department claims is collectable. No one can say with certainty that the department will be able to collect the latter sum, because it is an arbitrary amount based on assessments which have been varied as a result of further information placed in the hands of the department.

          <para class="block">The reasons for the issue of the circulars are obvious. The taxation of Crown leases was the subject of inquiry by a royal commission, and no doubt the department desired to safeguard its position, whilst at the same time recognizing the inadvisability of collecting the tax pending a decision as to the basis of assessment. How was the sum of £180,000 mentioned by the Minister arrived at? I believe that a considerable proportion of it represents assessments, such as those referred to in the letters I have read, which are subject to variation.

Of the £1,100,000 which the Minister said may have to be refunded, over £770,000 represents collections on assessments to which no objections have been lodged. Therefore, to that £770,000 the taxpayers have no legal or moral claim. The amount was collected in accordance with the law as it had been interpreted by the High Court up to that time, and the taxpayers knowing that they had the right of appeal lodged no protest, but paid in accordance with the demands of the department. The money was paid into the general revenue and that closed the transaction. I would be surprised if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> as a lawyer, would argue that in those circumstances the taxpayers have either a legal or a moral right to a refund of the money. If he does admit that, he may land the Government in considerable trouble in regard to both land taxation and customs taxation. If a person pays a tax without protest or objection, he thereby forfeits all rights, legal or moral, to the money. Therefore, I advise the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> not to endeavour to influence us by suggesting the possibility of the Commonwealth having to refund the £770,000 which has been already "paid without objection. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the merits of the bill. Unimproved value, as interpreted by the man in the street, means the value given to land by the presence and needs of the community. Value is added to land in two ways; the first is by the carrying out of public works such as roads, railways, water supplies, jetties, &amp;c. That value is created by the community and not by the individual, and as such is fairly subject to taxation. The other value is that created by the activity, energy and thrift of the owner. Believers in land taxation agree that such a value, which is the product of individual effort, should be exempt from taxation. "We should endeavour to bring that guiding principle to bear when dealing with this measure, and we can do so regardless of the procedure adopted by the Commissioner of Taxation in the past. </para>
          <para>Clause 2 of the bill proposes to omit the existing definitions of unimproved value and value of improvements, and to insert in lieu thereof the following - " Unimproved value," in relation to unimproved land, means the capital sum which the fee simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require..... " Value of improvements " in relation to land, means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act irrespective of the cost of the improvements. </para>
          <para>Provided further that in ascertaining the value of improvements no amount shall be included in such value in respect of any work done or expenditure incurred for the purpose of preventing land, or any improvements thereon, from deteriorating, or of maintaining land which has been improved, at its improved value whether by means of destroying animal pests or vegetable growths, or of preventing such pests or growths from- establishing themselves, or by any other means, but, in respect of fences and other structural improvements, effected for any of those purposes, which are oh the land at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purpose of this act, an amount shall, subject to the preceding proviso, be included. </para>
          <para>That definition may not be very plain, but if I understand the English language the Minister was not correct in replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> that the removal of suckers from land would be admitted as an improvement. Suckers are a vegetable growth, and vegetable growths are specifically excluded. In Western Australia if a red gum tree is felled, the stump produces in the following year a crop of suckers, which if neglected for three or four years will cost as much to remove as did the original tree. </para>

Stock cannot be depastured on land until the poison plant has been eradicated. You cannot eradicate that in one year; it must be done over a series of years. I take it that expenditure under that heading is, however, specifically excluded according to the wording of this section. It is not permissible to include in the cost of improvements expenditure incurred in the eradication of vegetable growths, or on preventing such growths from establishing themselves. Then let us consider expenditure on the removal of stones and rocks from land. When you have done that there is no improvement on the land, pertaining to the land, such as fences and other structural improvements. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.That is so. Let us see what the High Court has said in regard to some past cases. One might have thought from listening to the Minister that this was the first - occasion upon which this issue has come up ; but if honorable senators look at the consolidated act, they will see printed there notes relating to a number of cases that have come before the court on the question of unimproved values, and on the value of improvements. I propose to refer to some of those cases because they have an important bearing on the subject under discussion. In the first case mentioned it was held that: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To arrive at the unimproved value of land for the purposes of the act the improvements existing at the time of the valuation upon the land itself as legally incident to its enjoyment are to be assumed as not made, but the existence of part improvements, and the effect, which they or their use have had in bringing the land up to its then value, are not to be ignored. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That was in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Hie</inline><inline font-style="italic">Commissioner of Land Tax</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Nathan,</inline> (1913) 16 C.L.E., 654. AH the forms of improvement to which I have referred are very important elements in bringing land up to its existing value, and the High Court has ruled that they are not to be ignored. Another note reads - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Held bv the High Court that the word " improvements " in the definition of the term " unimproved value " includes such operations of man upon the land since it has ceased to be Crown land, the benefit of which continues at the date of valuation, and operations of nature which are only effectual by reason of what man has done as have contributed to bring about the present enhancement of the value of the land. <inline font-style="italic">Morrison</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Federal Commissioner of Land Tax,</inline> (1914) 17 C.L.R. 498. </para>

          <para>The next case is reported as follows: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Held by the High Court that the term " value of improvements " includes the present enhancement of the value of the land attributable to the operations of man upon the land effected since the land ceased to be Crown land, the benefit of which continues at the date of valuation, and also includes the present enhancement of value attributable "to those operations of nature which arc only effectual by reason of what man has done. <inline font-style="italic">Morrison v. Federal Commissioner of Land Tax.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I submit that if we pass this bill, we shall nullify those judgments of the High Court, because it is by the act of man in destroying and keeping destroyed vegetable growths that improvements which add to the value of the  land are effected. Yet  these improvements are specifically excluded by the clause I have quoted. If we pass clause 2 we shall be doing this thing with our eyes open. As a layman it appears to me that we shall be affecting not only the judgment to which the Minister referred, but past judgments of the court over a period of many years. It seems to me that clause 2 is indefensible as it stands, and I cannot support it. It ought to be amended in some way to give the owner of the land the benefit of those improvements which he effects by his own energy and skill, or the application of science to the working of his land. The value we want to tax is that which is created by the community. That is a fair principle in land taxation. </para>
          <para>I have already made certain references to Crown leases, but I wish to add something more. I was a member of Governments that were confronted with this difficulty for a great number of years. It became a veritable Serbonian bog: The more we tried to remedy the position, the worse it became. I well remember the Herculean efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing</inline> to find a solution, but he was unsuccessful. Finally, as a measure of desperation, the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> in 1919, suspended the collection of these taxes because the provision was unjust and unequal in its incidence ; it was doing no good ; it was injuring the pastoral industry; and it was hampering the land settlement policies of the States. No one knew just where he stood. We are endeavouring to tax the value of Crown leases, of which there are seven different kinds in Australia. There are the leases of the six State Governments, besides those in the Northern Territory, and they all vary. There are varying terms over which the leases extend; in some leases there are rights of resumption for all sorts of purposes; some have limited rights of resumption only. Some are subject to reappraisement at the end of ten years: others after twenty years, and others after 30 years. Notwithstanding all these differences, it was sought to frame a system of taxation that would tax the equivalent of the freehold value in all these separate and varying sorts of leases. After getting hopelessly bogged,, the Government of the day suspended the tax with a view to settling the matter one way or the other, either by evolving some sound principle on which we could proceed, or by abandoning the whole thing. Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watts'</inline> action was not followed up for some time, and it was not until considerably later that royal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter. I invite honorable senators, who wish to see into what a hopeless tangle the thing had drifted, to read the reports of the royal commissions of 1923 and 1925. The report issued in 1925 contains about 56 pages, and deals entirely with this subject. The reference to the commission was that it should " inquire into and report upon the method which should, in view of the decision of the Parliament of the Commonwealth that the taxation imposed on lessees' estates in Crown leases under the Land Tax Assessment Act. 1910-16 should be collected, be adopted for determining, upon the basis laid down by the act, the unimproved value of the land held under such leases." I invite honorable senators, if they feel so disposed, to read the involved arguments embodied in the report of the royal commission and to see what they can make of them. An extraordinary feature is that after all these inquiries by that commission, which had the benefit of the information obtained by a previous inquiry, its recommendations are not those which have been adopted by the Government. The recommendations of the royal commission which inquired into the method for determining the unimproved value of land held under Crown leases are to be found on page 44 of the report, and read - </para>

Then capitalize at appropriate rate of interest, and eliminate value of stock and improvements. The appropriate rate of interest to be used should be that disclosed by sales of freehold land nearest by distance and put to similar use as that of the subject area ; </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not know if honorable senators know what that means. I frankly confess that I do not. I have never been able to understand its meaning. When the Government of the day received that report it realized the position was hopeless and, consequently, did not take any action. It had already proposed that Parliament should repeal the whole thing, and Parliament was so convinced of the hopeless and absolute tangle, in view of the case which had been made out, that it repealed it. Put, unfortunately, it gave us this legacy. It said, in effect, to the Government, "You must try to collect the arrears," and this is the result of the endeavour that has been made to collect the arrears. There is a sorry story to tell of the various attempts to arrive at some basis by which the arrears could be collected with some element of justice. We have now, in this measure, another desperate attempt. I am quite sure of one thing, and that is, that this measure, if passed, will not be the end of our troubles. It will be the beginning of a fresh chapter. If it is passed it will lead to a fresh crop of litigation. The whole thing is so hopelessly involved that if we endeavour to stop one gap, we shall find a dozen others to-morrow. I know quite well what will happen immediately this measure becomes law. The lawyers will set to work; case after case will be brought before the High Court, and in three months the Minister will be coming along with another stop-gap. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.Golf has long ceased to be a prerogative of the aristocrat. One has only to visit golf-courses in Australia to find working men playing the game alongside capitalists. Luckily it is a game which can be played without any great expenditure - I can say that from personal experience. It is useless to speak of a golf-links as being exclusive. Some may be so regarded, but the same can be said of certain football and cricket grounds. I cannot enter the Melbourne Cricket Ground without paying, although the members of the Melbourne Cricket Club can do so by producing a pass. It is exclusive to that extent. I venture to say that Hagen or any other great golfer can only be seen at play by those who are prepared to pay. Prominent cricketers may be seen at play on the Melbourne Cricket Ground by those who are ready to pay for admission; but those who do so cannot play unless they are members of the club. It is all " tosh " to say that golf is an exclusive game, and in this instance the Government is playing to the gallery. </para>

              <para>- I desired to show that people were being driven off the land by taxation of this nature. In the year 1927-1928 the total value of the products of Australia was, in round figures, £453,000,000. Manufactures accounted for £158,000,000, and primary production for £294,000,000. Of our exportable products - and that is our real wealth - the primary producers were responsible for £100,000,000 out of a total of £144,000,000. Our chief export is wool. If this taxation is imposed upon Crown leaseholds in the outback parts of Australia, the wool industry will be seriously handicapped. </para>

              <para>- It is proposed in the bill to tax Crown leaseholds and to make the tax retrospective for twenty years. The operation of such a law must be detrimental to our primary production. "With one voice the Government is calling upon our primary producers to work harder, if that is possible, and produce more wool, mutton, beef, wheat and grass. "We all realize that we must produce more and export more if we are to balance our ledger. But what encouragement does the introduction of measures like this give to the pioneers who go into the hinterland of this great continent to work ? It seems as though every effort is being made to strangle the men who go out and blaze the trail of settlement. Not only are they called upon to pay heavy taxation, but on account of our high tariff they are obliged to pay inflicted prices for everything they require. They have to take all the risks of primary production and combat the pests which affect their various industries. On top of all that they are at present obliged to market their products under the most unfavorable conditions that have prevailed for a long time. Any attempt to collect this taxation from Crown lessees in the outback areas of Queensland in particular and throughout Australia in general will cause many settlers to abandon their holdings. It is most unfair that the settlers who paid taxation of this nature without protest, and who did not lodge an objection, will have to suffer for it. I have only to quote one concrete case, to show the absurdity of the whole position. I was managing-director of a leasehold property in the Northern Territory years ago. Although we spent £50,000 in fencing, bores and improvements generally, we were glad to sell out for £17,000. Yet we were taxed on the ludicrous unimproved value of £80,000. "We took legal advice and paid the tax under protest. It has since been refunded to us. Under the provisions of this bill the unfortunate persons who paid the tax without protest, will have no redress. In any case, after the series of bad seasons which has been experienced inland, many of the settlers will be unable to pay the tax. Several successive years of drought have been experienced in many pastoral areas, and, in addition to that calamity, the price of wool has decreased tremendously. Sheep are responsible for 50 per cent, of the exports from the Commonwealth, but the average price of wool last month was only 9.47d. per lb. For the first eight months of this financial year the average price was 10.58d. per lb., compared with 17d. for the similar period of last year. The price of wool is actually lower to-day than the average for the five years prior to the war, when it was 9£d. Seeing that the cost of producing wool has doubled since pre-war days, any attempt to collect this taxation under existing conditions must fail. The Government cannot get blood out of a stone. The people have not the money to pay, so that even if the High Court rules that this taxation may be legally imposed - and to do so it will have to reverse several previous decisions - the people will be unable to pay. In the 'last ten years the world's production of wool has increased by 20 per cent, but the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> consumption of it has decreased by 20 per cent. For the five years prior to the war the average price of wool was, as I have said, 9Jd. per lb. ; during the war years the average was 15£d. per lb., plus certain profits; and the average for the post-war period to the 30th June, 1928, has been I9d. per lb. The boom year was in 1924-25, when the average price was 26d. per lb. It appears that the average price for this year will be not more than lOd. per lb., which is between 3d. and 4d. per lb. below the cost of production. Prior to the war it was estimated that it cost about 8d. per lb. to produce wool. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In all these circumstances a severe hardship will be inflicted upon our primary producers if this taxation is imposed upon them, and particularly if the law is given a retrospective effect. Crown leaseholds have been taxed. It is an unfair class tax which singles out one section of the community, our primary  producers,  the people upon whom the country and all of us are dependent for the very existence and creation of wealth. I do not think it is just that these taxes should he collected. I believe that the Government is wasting its money and time in endeavouring to pass this bill at this juncture. </para>
          <para>I draw the attention of the Leader of the Senate- <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to what was recently said by the Prime Minister when he received a deputation from the Graziers Association. The right honorable gentleman expressed surprise and disapproval that a land-owner, who, by the application of work and science, made two blades of grass grow where only one had previously grown, should suffer by being subjected to additional land taxation. I can see no provision in this bill which encourages a farmer or grazier to improve his land by clearing, draining, sowing down permanent pastures, or improving his pastures by the application of artificial fertilizers. Those are not visible improvements. </para>

              <para>- It is not. It is because those men have applied scientific principles, and have spent money in improving their properties. I maintain that there is nothing in this bill to safeguard a man or to encourage him to improve his property. The Government should make every endeavour to encourage those on the land to put their properties to the best possible use, and to make them more productive. This bill tends to discourage that sort of thing. The method of assessing unimproved value for taxation purposes is to accept as a property's value its value in the market today, allowing deductions for buildings and similar visible improvements. What about those years which have been spent in effecting invisible improvements? I defy any one to assess the value. A land tax valuer does not take into consideration the labour expended, perhaps over a period of 50 years, in ring-barking, burning-off, and so on, or the improvement of pastures. Those are all invisible improvements. There is nothing in this bill to protect a man against an increase in land tax on freehold because he has done the very thing that he should be encouraged to do. </para>

          <para>I maintain that this land tax should be abolished. I have no time for the large owner who sits idly by and takes any increased value that might accrue from the efforts of the Government or his neighbours. Neither have I any time for the large land-owner who locks up his land and refuses to make it available for closer settlement, particularly by refusing to throw it open to people on the share farming system. I should like the Government to amend the bill to provide for the people who are using their land to its utmost productivity - such as for production and maintenance of registered stud sheep, which are national assets - also for those who make their land available to farmers who have not sufficient capital otherwise to settle on the land. I feel that this Government favors closer settlement. I would not object if it penalized those who lock up their land, but it should encourage those to whom I have referred. Take the effect of this measure on stud sheep flocks. </para>

              <para>- Sometimes, but there are a great many people in Australia to-day who have made a hobby of importing and establishing studs of various pure-bred animals. Many of these enthusiasts who import high class stock from Europe are losing money thereby. I admit that there are others who are very successful stud flock breeders, particularly of merino sheep. By the application of scientific methods and because of the suitability of the country for the job, they have' made a great deal of money. I supported the Government in its endeavour to safeguard our great national asset by prohibiting the export of merino stud sheep. </para>

              <para>- Our land taxation is full of anomalies. Who will go to outback leaseholds and subject himself to the hardships of such a life if he is to lie heavily taxed for his labours? There are certain pioneer pastoralist families now developing at great expense otherwise useless country away north of Leonora in <inline font-style="italic">dry</inline> outback areas of Western Australia. One I know has recently spent £100,000 in trying to develop his leasehold, and now it is proposed to tax such people on improvements to their properties, and to make the tax retrospective. That is not a fair or wise policy. The incidence by which it is proposed to assess the unimproved value of freehold land is all wrong, and I give notice of my intention to move later an amendment to the effect that land made available on just terms for share farming, and land being used for the production of stud stock, be exempt from land taxation up to an assessed unimproved value of £20,000. At present the exemption is only £5,000. We should give some encouragement to those men who have thrown open their estates for closer settlement under liberal share farming agreements, and also to those men who are building up and maintaining, at great expense, stud flocks. The smaller man has not the money with which to establish stud flocks, and he, therefore, has to rely upon these breeding establishments for the necessary sires. I intend at a later stage to move the amendment that I have foreshadowed'. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to say only a few words at this late hour in regard to the bill. Wherever I have been in Australia I have generally found that the objection that the primary producer has to land taxation is that the unimproved values assessed by the department are always inflated and fictitious. I am sorry indeed that the first action of this Government in regard to land taxation is to tighten up the law, and to increase unimproved values which are already the main cause of complaint among land-owners throughout this country. Wherever I go I find that the valuers do not pay proper regard to invisible improvements. The contract price for clearing land in a certain district may be 35s. an acre, but years of work in improving that land are necessary after that preliminary payment. There is root picking, stone picking, the provision of water and hundreds of other little improvements. A man will spend perhaps ten years in improving his property after the first clearing has been paid for. Yet, the taxation officer will come along and say that the cost of improving that land is 35s. an acre, although that is only the cost of the original contract. Poison plants have to be eradicated. The poison plant that grows in many parts of Western Australia is a big bush. It is easy to get rid of in the first year, but soon after it is chopped out hundreds of seedlings spring up. Clearing in that case is a recurring expenditure. It seems to me that one of the proposed amendments is specially designed to prevent the cost of the eradication of the poison plants from being regarded as an improvement. In the heavier timbered parts of Australia, such as Gippsland, and the south-west of Western Australia, the bracken fern is very troublesome particularly after the timber has been ring-barked, and the land partly cleared. Yet it is proposed under the bill that the destruction of vegetable growth that springs up after the first clearing is not to be taken as an improvement. This legislation will nullify to a great extent the valuable work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in the direction of eradicating pests in various parts of Australia. It is a wrong policy and, if carried out, will do a great deal of injury to the land settlement schemes which the States, with their limited resources, are endeavouring to carry out in different parts of Australia. As a matter of fact, in many parts of this country the real unimproved value of laud is next to nothing, or no more than a few shillings an acre. In Western Australia for years we invited men to settle on the land. Although the land in its unimproved state was worth very little, we knew that it would be of value in time. We gave each man 160 acres free of cost, provided that he lived on his property. We sold the settlers first-class land at 10s. an acre; second-class land at 6s. 3d. an acre, and third-class land at 3s. 9d. an acre. Those prices ruled for many years. </para>

              <para>- Yes. We charge only the cost of surveying. We gave the settlers twenty years in which to pay 10s. an acre for first-class land. If the price charged were 12s. 6d. an acre, we extended the term so that the settlers would pay only 6d. an acre a year without interest. The real unimproved value of that land was the price paid for it, or even less. It certainly was not more, because this land in its unimproved state was waterless and unproductive. Some of it grew poison plants, and in many instances was a menace to adjoining land-owners. It was the home of the dingo and the kangaroo, and any sheep or cattle venturing upon it were likely to be poisoned. After years of work and industry that land has been made one of the most valuable wheat and sheep areas in Australia, yet we are faced with the fact that the unimproved value is either nothing at all or only a few shillings an acre. A man and his family may have put in years of hard labour on the land and perhaps given up the struggle. Some one else may have taken possession, and, through his strenuous efforts, made that land valuable. Now legislation is brought down to assess the unimproved value of that land, regardless of the work that has been done since the first clearing. One of the great mistakes that we have made in regard to land taxation in Australia - and this legislation makes no alteration in this direction - is to permit the Taxation Department to carry out the valuations. This is a wrong principle, because there is a recurring and growing tendency on the part of the taxation officers to base their values on the last sale in a particular district. A man will very often pay from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. more than che proper value of land in order to give the property to his son. as a wedding present, and to keep the family close together. In that case, the taxation official would come along and value the whole of the district on the basis of that sale, despite the fact that it had been effected really for sentimental purposes. </para>

              <para>- It would certainly be better to avoid this duplication, and to recognize land taxation as belonging to the States and not the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth should vacate the field of land taxation altogether. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>High valuations are of no value to the bona fide settler. An official comes along and says "We think the land, which you regard as of little value, because you do not want to sell it, as valuable" because someone five miles away has sold his block at a high price. When the taxation on a man's block is increased he cannot pass it on. He is really better off when his valuations are not increased. Very often men who for sentimental reasons refuse to take a good price for their homes have had their valuations put up on that account. </para>
          <para>I object to the retrospective effect of this legislation. It is amazing that the House of Representatives should have passed a bill to enable a man to be re-assessed on his land as far back as 1910 and 1914. When a man pays his annual tax charge he thinks that it is done with, just as he thinks he is finished with his storekeeper when he pays his account. An honest man shows on his land tax return particulars of the whole of his land, and when he is assessed, and has paid taxation on it, there should be an end to the matter. Neither the Commonwealth nor a State should have the right to come along and say, even one year afterwards, " We want to re-assess your land and make retrospective collection." Why the Commonwealth should claim the right to assess a man for sixteen or twenty years back is incomprehensible. It is absolutely wrong in principle to do so, and I hope the Senate as the custodian of State rights will not permit such an injustice to be inflicted upon a worthy section of our community who, under existing conditions, are unfortunate enough to be land-owners. There is no time more unsuited for retrospective and unjust legislation of this nature than the present. Owing to drought and the low prices for wool and wheat, the producing interests already have the utmost difficulty in meeting their engagements in regard to the taxation they expect. </para>
          <para>An unjust feature of land taxation in general is that the tax is levied on people who, because of drought, may have no income for several years, whereas income tax is levied only on people who have income. It is wrong that a man whose capital is invested in land should be taxed whether he has an income or not. The person who puts his capital into a mortgage is not nearly so valuable to the country as he who will take up land and spend his capital on it. Yet the Government rightly, of course, taxes only the income from the mortgage, whereas in the case of the man who puts his capital into the land, it taxes him whether he derives an income or not, and it now goes further and claims the right to tax him back to 1910 and 1914. The Senate would be well advised to say "Away with this legislation altogether." Those who enjoy incomes, even if they have been  supertaxed  to the extent of 5, 10 or 20 per cent., are probably in a position to pay, because the tax is levied only when they have means to pay. The land-owner in the north of South Australia or in the dry districts of Victoria, Western Australia or New South Wales must meet his land taxation whether he has secured an income from the land or not, and he should certainly not be subjected to this retrospective and harassing legislation. It is most difficult to reconcile this proposal with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin's</inline> plea to the farmers to grow more wheat and to the pastoralists to increase the wool clip. It seems to me that the bill is ill-advised, and that the present is an untimely period for proposals to increase retrospective land taxation, and tighten up the definition of unimproved land value, which has already been more injurious to the interests of the producer than the rate of the tax itself. </para>
          <para>Land values are now receding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> pointed out this afternoon that in South Australia the price of land is decreasing, yet the Minister representing the Treasurer, in reply to a question asked by me, says that it is not proposed to levy the land tax for this year on the decreased values, and that the suggestion to do so will be a matter for consideration later. Judging by this legislation, it appears to me that the taxation officials are looking round for means to increase the revenue from the Land Tax by tightening up the provisions of the act. </para>
          <para>One of the most objectionable features of the bill is the clause which declares that no allowance is to be made for expenditure incurred in destroying animal pests or vegetable growths if the land has already been cleared. In many parts of Australia rabbits are a very grave menace. Their burrows are everywhere, yet no allowance is to be made for getting rid of them. According to my reading of the clause, no allowance is to be made for destroying animal pests or vegetable growths or preventing such pests or growths from establishing themselves. </para>

            <para>- The cost of erecting a fence is very little compared with the expenditure involved in getting rid of those big burrows that unfortunately exist on many Crown lands that are now being taken up by settlers. This bill specifically declares that no allowance shall be made for getting rid of these pests, yet no greater improvement can be effected to virgin land. If mallee and other suckers are neglected after timber has been rolled down, it becomes much more expensive in after years to get rid of them than the cost of the original rolling. I have already referred to bracken fern and the poison plant. It requires years of vigilance on the part of a farmer to combat them, and often his wife and even small children can be seen helping in this work. The poison plant is responsible for great loss of stock, and it seems to me that improvements of the kind to which I have referred ought to be taken into consideration. Similarly, allowance should be made for the value of improvements due to the destruction of the prickly pear. I hope that this bill will be carefully reviewed. Land tax has to be paid by the settler, whether he obtains a reasonable income or not; it is a charge that he cannot pass on. I hope that the Senate will not permit any further unjust penalties to be imposed on those who have their capital invested in land instead of in mortgages or government bonds where it is safe. </para>

            <para>. - I do not profess to be familiar with all the land legislation that has been enacted, but I have listened carefully to the objections taken to the bill. While some of them may be valid, others are certainly not. One of the chief objections urged by honorable senators opposite was that no tax should be levied in respect of improvements that require to be continued from year to year, such as the destruction of poison plants and bracken fern. If such objections were allowed, we might as well repeal the land tax altogether. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> referred to an added value which he thought the use of superphosphate gave to land. I have used a good many tons of superphosphate, and I contend that it does not add permanent value to the land to which it is applied. It has been proved by chemical analysis that its application, while enabling the farmer to produce a few good crops, will also stimulate certain chemical constituents in the soil in such a way as to cause valuable ingredients in that land to be exhausted. Therefore, the application of fertilizers is only of temporary value. Suppose that an area of prickly pear land has been improved. If we included in valuing the improvements, the cost of keeping the land free from prickly pear, we should soon swallow up not only the land tax being paid, but also the value of the land itself. I admit there is something in the argument about invisible improvements. In some cases there is no difficulty in distinguishing between improved and unimproved land. When a settler carves out a home for himself in the bush, it is easy to ascertain what his improvements have cost him, but when improvements are widespread the valuer does not know how much to attribute to nature and how much to credit to individual settlers. Improvements such as fences and other structures ought not to be taxed, but it would be absurd to say that because a farmer had destroyed certain weeds or burrs that had sprung up on his land, he should be relieved of taxation to the extent of the value of that work. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The measure is not intended to prevent the levying of taxation; its object is to stop a leakage of tax that was not contemplated when the act was passed. I understand that the High Court has ruled that land cannot be taxed where a leasehold is liable to resumption, owing to the difficulty in ascertaining its value. In the case of an area of 10,000 acres, possibly only 50 acres are liable to be resumed. To say that the subtraction of such a small area from a large holding  would render it difficult to arrive at a fair valuation of the taxable amount of the leasehold is an absurdity. Then again, the idea that land, the rental value of which is liable to re-appraisement, cannot be properly and accurately valued, seems to me to be" a fiction. There should be no difficulty in arriving at the annual value of such land. Action to overcome these difficulties is not only necessary to conserve the revenue, but desirable also, because it will not permit certain taxpayers, on a mere technicality, to evade taxation which others are compelled to pay. Most of the objections that have been raised to this measure are not valid. As to its retrospective provisions, I assume that they will not in any way permit the department to re-assess for taxation from 1910 or 1914 land which has not already been liable to taxation. These retrospective provisions have been inserted, I take it, for the purpose of preventing evasions of taxation which has been legitimately levied, but through some technicality, has been evaded by the respective taxpayers. If there is a possibility of any injustice in the operation of these provisions I am sure that, in committee, the Minister in charge of the bill will welcome any amendment to provide against them. Speaking generally, the bill has been discussed by honorable senators opposite as though it were a proposal to impose new taxation, instead of being -merely a machinery measure to prevent leakage in taxation, the principles of which have been previously confirmed by this Parliament. </para>

            <para>. -  I hope the Senate will unanimously reject the bill. In the course of the debate on the ministerial statement to-day we heard honorable senators supporting the Government explaining why it was necessary practically to subsidize our farmers to remain on the land and increase the production of wheat. Now the Government- proposes to extract every penny it can possibly get from landholders by this taxation. Why should a man who has invested his money in land be taxed on his capital as well as on his income? There is in fact no justification for this system of taxation. The excuse is advanced that the Government should obtain some revenue from what is termed the unearned increment. But in addition to taxing the unearned increment, the Government is seeking to whittle away the basis upon which the original Land Tax Act was drawn, and is endeavouring to tax part of the improved value. In the original definition, " unimproved value " was stated to mean the value the land would have borne had the improvements on it not been made. Gould anything be plainer than that? The new definition of " unimproved value " to be found in this bill reads as follows : -  " Unimproved value " in relation to improved land means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> a bona fide seller would require, assuming that, at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act, the improvements thereon did not exist. </para>

              <para>- Then why is it considered necessary to change the phraseology and confuse the people? Some mention has been made of the invasion of land by bracken fern. During the war a considerable area of farm property in Gippsland, valued then at from £20 to £25 per acre, became valueless owing to the growth of bracken fern and invasion by rabbits. Hundreds of original selections, subject to mortgage, to-day have no value at all ; but here and there where farmers' sons did not go to the war, are to be found properties still in good condition and worth £20 per acre. Under what system is the value of these properties to be determined. Is it the view of the department that land covered with bracken fern and invaded by rabbits is still worth £20 or £25 per acre, or has the department written down those properties to their unimproved state? And if so, why should a man who has kept his land in good condition be penalized by taxation on a basis of £20 or £30 per acre whilst his neighbour who, through misfortune or from other causes, has allowed his property to be overrun with bracken fern and rabbits, escapes? </para>

              <para>- If it were possible for a man to obtain a block in its virgin state to-day, and if he bad to pay the ordinary labour costs to clear it, and bring it to a cultivable condition, it would cost him about £40 per acre. But the land to which I refer was not occupied in that way. Thirty or 40 years ago a man with his wife and family took up a selection and set to work to ring-bark the big timber, and cut down and burn out the scrub. For the. first five years or so, he and his family practically had to exist on opossums and wallabies. A considerable area of that country has reverted, not to its primeval state perhaps, but to a condition approaching it, owing to the growth of bracken fern and infestation by rabbits. </para>

              <para>- There are larger areas which the settlers have been obliged to abandon. The proposed definitions will make the law more uncertain and difficult to administer, and I am unable to understand why the Government should propose to depart from the old definition that unimproved value means the value that the fee-simple would realize " assuming that the improvements (if any) thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made." Those words have not been affected by any decision of the High Court, and I can only assume that the alteration proposed in the bill is due to the reasons mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce. Apparently, the Government is pursuing the old vendetta against the wealthy squatters, and desires to rub their noses deeper in the dirt. Recent events should have brought deeper wisdom and greater breadth of vision to members of the Labour party. For several years Australia has been living on the sheep's back, but, owing to the slump in the price of wool, that support has been withdrawn from us. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that people who take up new holdings in the outback portions of Australia should be subsidized rather than penalized.

              <para>- The honorable senator takes care to keep off the land now. The Leader of the. Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> has said, emphatically, that this bill involves no change in the law as it was understood. But there is nothing to indicate that the cost of clearing or removing rocks from the land will be included in the allowance for improvements. The definition refers to improvements " on the land " but cleaving is not on the land, and the bill seems to indicate an intention on the part of the Taxation Department to escape making allowance for improvements of that character. An assessor may not be able to realize that a paddock, now cultivated, was so covered with stones a few years ago that it could not be ploughed. All improvements are not, "on" the land; in this case the absence of the stones, which constituted an impediment to cultivation, is the improvement which makes the land valuable. I do not pretend to the omniscience of the Leader of the Senate, but as I understand the bill, the only improvements to be allowed are those " on the land ".

            <para>'. - If there was any strength in the arguments of the Leader of the Senate, it was; in respect of the second part of the measure which he said was introduced in consequence of the decision of the High Court in the Northampton Pastoral Company's case. The court decided that the lease did not come within the combined operation of sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Land Tax Assessment Act. The  majority  judgment said that the section which is now proposed to be amended was a reasonable provision to apply to private leases. The court went on to say - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The majority of the court came to the conclusion that Parliament had never intended this provision to apply to Crown leases. It is obvious that Parliament did. intend it to so apply, and the Government has said, in effect, that if the  language in the original act is not sufficiently clear, the intention of the Parliament shall be again expressed in unmistakable terms. There is one aspect, of this matter which, I think, has escaped the attention of the Minister. It is the extraordinary situation that will obtain if this legislation is amended after the issue of the notices which, as I heard for the first time to-night, were sent to leaseholders, and which were calculated to lull them into a false sense of security. Now, despite those notices, the Government proposes to alter the law so as to place them in an entirely different position. No leaseholder who received one of those notices could come to any other conclusion than that conditions would not be altered until he h'ad an opportunity of appealing, or of taking other steps to protect himself. Unless the Government can assure us that other notices were sent out subsequently it is only reasonable to assume that leaseholders have all along been under the impression that their interests were secure. The notices of which I speak were sent out by the department, and were signed by the  Deputy  Commissioner of Taxation.. It does not matter under what government they were sent out ; they were issued through the department, and we are now asked by the Government to alter the legislation which? directly affects the leaseholders. Very strong language would be used to describe such procedure in private life. </para>
          <para>Another aspect of the matter which requires consideration is that covered by the second portion of the bill. I venture the opinion that the Government will not be a single half -penny better off under the new legislation than it. would, have been under the old. I suggest that if the exigencies of the financial position are such that it is necessary for the Government to take steps to safeguard this £160,000, it should, when bringing in any retrospective legislation, not only exclude those persons who have obtained judgments of the court, but also all those who have entered objections,, or who have given notice of appeal. We all know that in many cases notices or objections are not sent on, or set down for appeal. The taxpayers rely on the result of test cases. Probably the Northampton case was regarded as a test case. I am not in a position to say, but probably scores of others were relying on the outcome of that case. Is the Government, by means of this legislation, going to allow a man to escape merely because he was fortunate enough to be the subject of a test case, while all the others who were interested with him to an equal degree are to be made to suffer? I suggest that, for the credit of this Parliament, we should not allow sections 4 and 5 of the bill to pass without altering them so that they may not affect any assessment that is the subject of an objection or a pending appeal. </para>
          <para>In regard to the other portion of the bill, I confess that I do not think that the Leader of the Government in the Senate made out a case for the alterations which are proposed. I have not yet had an opportunity to read the decision in  McGeoch's  case, but I trust that I shall be able to do so before we reach the committee stage to-morrow. I believe, however, that it was stated that that decision was a confirmation of the principle laid down in the Morrison and Fisher cases. In the Morrison case we have this principle emphasized in the most unmistakable language by that master of his profession, the late Chief Justice Griffith. After quoting the section of the act, he said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It seems plain enough that that means that the value of the improvements is the present enhancement of the value of the land attributable to the operations of the man upon the land, the benefit of which is continuous, including also, in some cases, improvements not actually effected upon the land itself, to which qualification it is not necessary to refer for present purposes. What operations of man are improving? When I say "operations of man," 1 think the term should be limited to what is done by the owner for the time being, that is, after the land has ceased to be Crown land. </para>

          <para class="block">I cannot distinguish between "suckering" and keeping land free from prickly pear. "  Suckering  ", as I understand it, is eliminating those growths which proceed from the roots of the mallee or other kindred gums, and which constantly appear unless careful attention is given to their removal over a period of years. If this was the principle applied by the High Court, what earthly reason is there for the Government, or the department, to ask Parliament to alter it. It has been known ever since 1913, up to the present, that it would be applied. The High </para>
          <para class="block">Court has applied exactly the same principle, and at this late period in the administration of the act it is said, in effect, that Parliament and the High Court were wrong. If it is said that the same principle is being applied as in the McGeoch case; it would be an extraordinary act on our part to allow this measure to pass in its present form. Without having given detailed consideration to the whole of the circumstances, I submit that the departmental view in the McGeoch case appears to turn on the fact that the appellant in purchasing his land allowed for the eradication of the prickly pear year by year. There is no principle behind that. It is, I consider, an individual case, and comparable with the decision in the Jowett case, which turns on fact alone. I venture to say that the whole situation has been misconceived, and that no case has been made out in support of the proposed amendment of the law. Further difficulties will arise necessitating fresh litigation, to which I, as a member of the legal profession, do not object. But it seems to me that when' we have a settled method of dealing with the improved and unimproved values of land, including judicial decisions on the subject extending over nearly twenty years, and the whole position clearly defined by the High Court, the Government is taking an extremely dangerous step in endeavouring to amend the legislation in the direction proposed. If the latest judgment embodied a reversal of the principle laid down in other judgments, I could understand the department being eager to deal with the subject in this way. But as I am informed that these judgments merely confirm the principles laid down in previous decisions, I do not feel disposed to agree to an amendment which would overthrow the settled practice as determined by the legislature, and as confirmed by the High Court from time to time. I do not wish to enter into a controversy as to the amount to be collected. That seems unarguable, particularly as it is to be made retrospective. If we examine the definition very carefully it will be seen that, notwithstanding the decision in the Morrison case, and subsequently in the Keogh case, the  draftsman has eliminated anything in the way- of improvements that are not actually on the land. Further, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> mentioned, the bill clearly indicates that the department is not going to allow for the suckering of land, although such work was allowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich in the Keogh case. All I can hope is that the Leader of the Government who I know appreciates the value of the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will protect those who are engaged in the era diction- of prickly pear. I think that the Senate should oppose the first portion of the bill unless adequate reasons are given for its retention. If the Government is still anxious to chase this will-of-the-wisp and is able to retain this £160,000 to the Crown, we shall have no objection to offer. "We should, however, do justice to those people who have taken steps to protect themselves by forwarding notices of objection. </para>

If we refer to the Land Tax Assessments Acts of New Zealand, Victoria and Western Australia, we shall find that they are almost identical in this regard. I am not aware that any trouble has ever arisen in connexion with their administration.

            <para>- If this were a bill for the repeal of the Land Tax Assessment Act I should put up both hands for it, but this bill in my opinion should be rejected. I think that the Commonwealth  i  should never have entered the field of land taxation. I remember that away back in 1910, when, God forgive me, I voted Labour, paeans of praise went up because under this act the midlands of Tasmania were to be made to blossom like the rose, because a few bloated breeders of merino sheep, who were absolute excrescences on the landscape, were to be turned out ' and the land was to be taken by hundreds of other settlers, who would develop, small holdings. The object of the land tax was, of course, to break up large estates but it failed to do so. The experiment was tried in three instances in the Tasmanian midlands, and it proved a most dismal failure, for the reason that the land had to be most carefully nursed and fertilized to enable it to carry an absolute maximum of one sheep to the acre. The wise acres who entered upon this scheme knew nothing whatever about land, or primary production, but they set out in  theory to revolutionize the pastoral industry, increase the population of Tasmania, and add greatly to the productivity of the island. We were told that the land was being used in a most shocking and wasteful manner by the big merino breeders of that day and that everything was to be altered. Now we know that all these great schemes have come to naught. I regard the entry of the Commonwealth into the field of land taxation as an absolute intrusion. This field should have been left to the States. </para>

          <para>I wish to refer briefly to the proposal to tax golf clubs. I do so, not merely because I play golf, but because I regard this as class taxation. An interjection was made during this debate to the effect that these people should get a "kick in theneck," and should be taxed. As a matter of fact, they are already being taxed up to the hilt apart altogether from golf. All golf clubs are not like the big clubs of Melbourne and Sydney. Years ago I was a member of a little golf club in a bush town. After a hard struggle the club managed to get a piece of land near the sea coast which was practically worthless. It was covered with marram grass and no one would ever have wasted time on it in the ordinary course of things. But almost the whole village played golf, and every Saturday afternoon the members of the club formed a working bee until they got the ground into decent condition. Occasionally we had 30 or 40 school children down and paid them 6d. each for helping to clear the bracken from the links. There are hundreds of similar clubs throughout the Commonwealth. It is insanity to propose class taxation of this description. This is nothing but an attempt to vent spite upon the people who play golf, because they are supposed to be the representatives of " fat." I should like to see the members of this Government and their supporters take up golf. They would be better men and better sports. They would become broader in their outlook and in their forehead. They would be better men in mind and body and soul. I intend in committee to move an amendment to delete this objectionable provision. </para>

It has been considered by the Senate more than once. The class of club referred to by the honorable senator would not possess land of an unimproved value' of £5,000 and, therefore, it would not be taxable. After all, golf is a luxury.

Bowling is perhaps a greater luxury than golf ; but it would be entirely misleading to, say, the people of England, to put a provision into this bill which would suggest that some of our bowling clubs are using land the unimproved value of which is £5,000.

          <para>Mention was made of bracken infested land, and of the poison land of Western Australia. Some honorable senators oppose this bill because they do not believe in land being taxed by the Commonwealth Government. But this is not a debate on the merits or demerits of the system of land taxation; we are concerned now with the question whether certain classes should or should not be exempt. Assuming that the land tax is an equitable one, let me take the case of a man who buys land which is liable to be infested with bracken, and which has to be cultivated each year in order to keep that bracken down. What is his position in relation to every other man holding land? The Government has to decide the most equitable manner of imposing taxation on land values. If it were not for the bracken that land would be worth, say, £10 per acre, unimproved; but, owing to the necessity for eradicating the bracken, its unimproved value is set down at £9. That man pays £9 per acre for the land, and accepts the liability of having to expend £1 per acre to keep it clear of bracken. All that the Government claims is that, having made him an allowance of £1 per acre in the unimproved value, he should make no further claim for a deduction. It is the value of the land with the bracken on it that has first to be determined in fixing the tax. </para>

The Western Australian Government decided upon a 3,500 farms scheme; but, after trees upon the country selected had. been cleared, the soil analysis of the adjoining area disclosed that the alkali previously lying dormant had suddenly become active. Salt came to the surface and the land was ruined. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator will not realize that, if you buy land on the terms that I have described, it is the value of that land with the pest upon it that has to be determined in fixing the tax. He wants the value of the land declared upon what it was sold to the purchaser for. But that sale was made upon the distinct understanding that the buyer, to keep it up to standard, would have to pay £1 per acre to fight the pest. </para>

          <para>If the principle of land taxation is sound, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> must realize that the land-owner cannot claim the value of his property's potentialities. Once you demonstrate those potentialities the land that you bought at £2 per acre might be worth £10 per acre. Surely the honorable senator would not contend that any human agency was responsible for the difference in value between the £2 and £10 an acre to which he referred? Yet he claims that the whole of the £8 should be deducted when assessing taxation. </para>

              <para>- Certainly; but in the final analysis it is necessary to decide what is the most equitable way of distributing the tax, which the honorable senator's party considers should be collected. Similar remarks apply to the rabbit pest. The Government has taken the best advice and submits amendments to the act in the best of faith. It merely asks the Senate to agree to a bill which has been sent up to this House, with its purpose to substitute appropriate words in the place of inappropriate words, so that the clear intention of Parliament might be adequately expressed in the statutory laws. </para>
