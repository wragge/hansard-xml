                            <para>- Yes. Great Britain charges a fee of £10 for naturalization; New Zealand, £2 ; Canada, five dollars ; and the United States of America, twenty dollars. The inquiries and reports necessary to determine whether an applicant is entitled to the privileges given by naturalization involve the Commonwealth in considerable expense, and there is, further, a contingent liability, as naturalized persons are eligible for old-age and invalid pensions. Naturalization gives those material advantages, together with the privilege of Australian citizenship. That aliens residing in Australia are, to a greater degree, seeking to be naturalized, is evident from the fact that last year 1,732 naturalization certificates were issued, and only 909 in 1925. I understand that the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition regards the bill as a non-contentious measure. </para>

                        GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [11.17].  -  My only comment on the hill is that I am astonished at the moderation of the Government in regard to the proposed fee for naturalization, which, I am of opinion, might very well have been made higher. This is a step that should have been taken long ago. I am heartily in accord with the object of the bill.

Why is it " to be prescribed " ? It is conceivable that some future government might take advantage of this provision to prescribe a prohibitive fee as an obstacle to naturalization.

                            <para>. -  Whether the amount of the fee should be stated in the bill or left, to be prescribed is, I think, a matter to be discussed in committee. The work involved in dealing .with the applications for naturalization varies greatly. As a Minister, it has been my misfortune on one or two occasions to have to sign some hundreds of letters of naturalization, and I know from the documents which thus came before me that while, in some cases, the procedure is perfectly simple, in others the amount of work involved is considerable. Therefore, I think it is better to provide that the fee shall be prescribed. The Government may find it necessary to vary the charge in some circumstances. A government must be allowed a certain amount of discretion administratively. That is the only reason that I can suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> for the fact that the  amount has not been specifically stated in the bill. I speak out of a personal experience of the difficulties that are encountered in such matters. </para>

Until the present time a fee has not been charged. While it is the intention of the Government to charge a uniform fee, circumstances may arise necessitating a departure from that practice. The Government is anxious not to make this a revenue-producing measure, but simply to prescribe a fee that will recoup the Treasury the expense incurred in prosecuting necessary inquiries. </para>

I admit that a government must be trusted not to use improperly a power of this kind; but it is obvious that it could be used to increase the difficulties of persons, who legitimately desire to take out naturalization papers.

Although in the past trades unions were rather generous in the passing of resolutions against compulsory arbitration, nothing was done to give effect to these resolutions. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions found it necessary to adopt a decision recommending all unions to boycott the Arbitration Court as the tool of the bosses, from which the workers can expect nothing but reduced wages and the lowering of the standard of living. This decision will, we hope, help to disillusion the workers in regard to Arbitration. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREID. - I admit that many employers have spoken in a similar strain, but as their remarks have been quoted in the Senate previously, I shall not repeat them now. I admit also that many trade unions are strongly in favour of the Arbitration Court, and have always spoken in support of it. Those unions have obeyed its awards, as have also many employers. But the "die-hard" employer, and those who have been hurt by the dual system of control, have not a good word to say for the Arbitration Court. I cannot understand why the Government should profess to uphold the Arbitration Court when the engineers who control the machine - their  own followers - condemn it. All the powers which the Constitution could vest in a government would not satisfy men who have opposed awards which were against them, notwithstanding that these awards were based on economic facts. Only when the Bruce-Page Government sought to amend the act in 1928-29, in the interests of peace in industry, did these people revolt. </para>
                    <para>I was pleased to hear that the Government has decided to withdraw the referendum proposals for further consideration. They certainly require more careful examination. To-day, the men in the Labour movement who have condemned the arbitration machine are silent, because they expect the present Government to introduce class legislation which will enable them to exercise more tyrannical powers than in the past. <inline font-style="italic">No reform</inline> of the Arbitration Court or of arbitration laws can alter economic facts, or satisfy people who are opposed to arbitration. The duty of the Government in this time of depression is to find work for the unemployed rather than to improve still further the position of men who, while enjoying the privileges which arbitration has brought, condemn the system. Senators Barnes and Hae are as well acquainted as I am with the conditions in industry which resulted in a demand for arbitration. They know also what arbitration has achieved for the workers. </para>
                    <para>When I was a member of the Labour movement I thought that by nationalizing our industries we should assist the workers and place industry on a proper basis. Experiments in that direction were made in Queensland; but, although many thousands of pounds were spent on big " schemes, not one of them proved successful, notwithstanding that the workers were paid high wages and given good conditions. For instance, two coal mines in which the men worked under the best conditions possible were opened. The men- employed there caused such trouble that, although the Minister in charge was a big-hearted man who wished to help them all he could, he was finally compelled to close down the enterprise in order to avoid further loss to the Government and to the people. Nationalization of the coal industry has already been attempted, and the attempt has been defeated by the workers themselves. A recent example of the refusal of Labour leaders to face economic facts was furnished during the negotiations between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary,</inline> Commissioner of Railways in New South Wales, and the railway employees. The Railway Department in New South Wales was losing heavily, as, indeed, are the railway services of all the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> asked the men to meet him in conference to arrange some method of stopping the drift in the department's finances without inflicting undue hardship upon themselves. All his efforts to arrive at a settlement were opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jock</inline> Garden and other extremists, who tried to stir up trouble among the employees in the workshops, and on the permanent way. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> was unable to achieve anything until he negotiated with the men themselves. He put the position before the men and they, with their natural commonsense, recognized that something would have to be done. A settlement was reached under which the men were required to work longer hours, but that was better than the prospect of starvation which otherwise faced thousands of employees. It may be said that the settlement involved an increase in working hours and a reduction in wages for the railway workers, but no fair-minded person can deny that, in the circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> did the best thing for the public and the men themselves. I do not propose to debate the matter further because, after all, the issue is no longer a live one ;  but, in conclusion, I propose to quote an extract from an address delivered a long time ago by the Greek philosopher, Pythagoras, who was one of the outstanding products of a civilization which has never quite been equalled. This is what he said - </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat referred to the proposal of the Government as being no longer a live issue, but the Government will probably find, as other Governments have found before, that ghosts of t his kind can cause much uneasiness. When considering proposals of this kind one should try to remember the object which the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they introduced into the Constitution even those limited Commonwealth powers which it is now the wish of the Government to have extended. There is no doubt that when the Constition was framed most of the statesmen responsible for it had in mind the great industrial troubles of the 'nineties, and were determined that the Commonwealth Parliament should be empowered to function in respect of what they regarded as Australian-wide industrial matters. The great objective of arbitration, whether compulsory or voluntary, has always been industrial peace. The framers of the Constitution recognized, as we recognize now. the need for obtaining and maintaining industrial peace, and avoiding the wastefulness of industrial strife. Honorable senators supporting this measure may have read the observations of the  President  of the American Federation of Labour, who said - </para>

I am confident that we can minimize industrial controversy through a proper regard and recognition of the rights of both employers and employees. The right of the employer to manage his industry, to control it, and to receive a fair profit upon his investment should he maintained and recognized. The right of the employees to organize, to bargain collectively, to be represented in conference with employers through their chosen representatives, is a right which should be readily accorded and completely recognized. Supplementing the recognition of these simple rights must come understanding, co-operation, and the manifestation of a mutuality of interests in the management and conduct of industry. </para>

                    <para class="block">The American Federation of Labour has declared that the standard of living depends upon productivity, and of that contention I think there is a general recognition. A paragraph recently appeared in a leading Australian journal to this effect, "There is in our midst the will to industrial peace; the problem is how to make that will prevail." I do not entirely agree with the conclusions reached by that journal, but I submit that an overwhelming majority of honorable senators believe that there is in our midst a will to secure industrial peace, and are endeavouring to make that will prevail. In furtherance of the great objective which the framers of the Constitution had in view, the Government has suggested an amendment of the Constitution to extend the power of this Parliament to enable it to make laws to ensure the industrial peace of this country. The limited industrial powers granted to the Federal Parliament under the Constitution have been interpreted in various ways; but I direct the attention of honorable senators to some observations made by the framers of the Constitution when undertaking their important task. Their desire was, not to set up a huge legal system with which would necessarily be associated many entanglements, but to provide a simple method of settling disputes between employers and employees. They were anxious to devise a means that would be acceptable to both parties, and in which both sides would have confidence. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who, at the Federal Convention, was the sponsor of this proposal, said that there was a desire that the Federal Parliament should be empowered to establish such industrial courts as it thought fit. He did not ask the convention to say that arbitration should be compulsory, or" that steps should be taken to secure the settlement of industrial disputes. He only wished the Federal Parliament to be given power to legislate on the subject of the establishment of industrial courts. In that contention he was supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs, the present Chief Justice of Australia, who said that if the Federal Parliament, in attempting to legislate satisfactorily, did not do so effectively, the Parliament would be able to repeal its enactments. I direct the attention of honorable senators to one or two observations of gentlemen of that time who were not so sanguine as to the success of an Australian-wide arbitration system as was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> "Higgins, and some associates of mine. The opponents of the system urged that it was a dangerous power, and that to pass legislation of the nature suggested was in itself - I am now using the language of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Downer - to extend the area of quarrels. One can realize in the light of subsequent happenings how prophetic were those words. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin  dealt with the. intricacies of the problem, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton strongly opposed the inclusion of the power and expressed his agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, who said - </para>

                            <para>- If conditions have improved to a marked degree during the past twenty years there should be no necessity to amend the legislation in the direction proposed. The submission of this proposal, is a recognition by the Government and by the employers and employees that industrial harmony does not prevail in this country. However honorable senators may view these proposals, they must admit that we would be in a much better position industrially if we had some method of settling disputes other than by recourse to the courts. The present procedure usually results in a battle of wits between "the experts employed by the parties to a dispute. The limited industrial powers granted to the Federal Parliament were inserted in the Constitution only on ;i narrow majority, and under these powers various arbitration acts have been passed by this Parliament from time to time.. The present proposal is to extend the.1 powers of the Commonwealth Parliament to a marked degree, but even if adopted by the Parliament and the people, will not give the Commonwealth Parliament exclusive power to legislate in that regard. As the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> indicated, the whole field of industrial legislation may be covered, except in one particular to which I shall later direct particular attention. I do not think any honorable senator ha3 any objection to industrial disputes being settled ; any opposition raised is based on the method by which they are to be settled. It is the difficulties of dealing with the problems arising under our present system that cause so much trouble. The thing is complex, though it should be simple, and full of entangling legalisms though it should be direct. Men who do npt understand the intricacies of different industries are obliged to deal with them. It is on these grounds that exception has been taken to the Arbitration Court system by employers and some trade unionists. </para>

                    <para>The question is, where should the power rest in order to get the best results? Is it desirable that it should rest with the Commonwealth authority or with the States? We have heard numerous speeches in this chamber about the difficulties that are caused by the dual" control of industry, but the policy which the Government is now advancing will not lead to the abolition of duality in control. It was the duty of the Government to have advised honorable senators in unambiguous terms of the policy that it intended to adopt if the people grant the extended power it desires, but it has not done so. Some little time ago I coined a happy phrase when I referred to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as an " industrial bigamist ". Evidently he still desires the parties in industry to have the right to take advantage of whichever industrial authority they please* at any given time. Under the present system the workers may take advantage of the State authorities if they desire, but unions which have brancb.es in more than one State may easily bring themselves within the federal jurisdiction. It is this fact that has led to chaos in the management of industrial affairs. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately, the policy of the Government is obscure, though it should have been stated clearly. "We have been left to draw conclusions from stray phrases in the speeches delivered by Government supporters upon this measure. I desire to know definitely whether the policy of the Government is conciliation, or control by some judicial system, or some system of committees, such as prevails in Queensland. I also wish to know whether the penalties provided in the Arbitration Act, are to be abolished. During the regime of the previous Government an effort was made to ascertain the opinion of the leaders of the industrial movement on this subject. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions was asked by letter whether it desired the penalties to be abolished. It seems to me that if we are to retain the rule of law, the penalties should remain, but should  be made  effective. If, on the other hand, we are to adopt a system of conciliation with the object of promoting harmony and good-will, though that will be difficult to achieve, the penalties should be abolished. But if that is done, I suggest that we shall get back to the rule of tooth and claw visualized, a few days ago, by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes).</inline></para>
                    <para>So far, the only thing that has been compulsory about our arbitration system has been the arbitration part of it. There has been no effective power to compel either party to abide by the awards of the court. We are faced with a particularly difficult problem. In 1927 the previous Government consulted both the employers and the trade union leaders freely with the object of ascertaining exactly what they wanted in regard to the retention of penalties against strikes and lockouts, and neither side was agreeable to the complete abolition of penalties. When the Australasian Council of Trade Unions was asked whether it was in favour of the penalties, it delayed replying for a considerable time, and then wrote to the effect that the different unions would have to be approached specifically on the subject. All further attempts to obtain a definite answer from it were abortive. </para>
                    <para>The Senate is surely entitled to some information as to the policy the Government will adopt if extended industrial power is given to this Parliament. This is particularly necessary in view of the failure of the previous Administration to get any definite information from either side in industry as to the kind of machine it desired to be established for the settlement of industrial troubles. We are all familiar with the difficulties of the present situation. It is manifestly impossible for an arbitration judge to settle effectively the disputes that occur in intricate industries. I saw one judgment of an Arbitration Court judge which ran into 123 foolscap pages. Many judgments fill more than 60 pages of typewritten manuscript. In one case I remember a judge was required to fix the price of hundreds of different garments. It takes the employers and employees in that industry many years to qualify themselves to determine these matters, and it is impossible for a judge to do it in a few weeks. It is equally impossible for us who wear the long robe to deal effectively with these subjects. When one comes to consider the enormous scope of industry one must realize that it is beyond the mental or physical capacity of one human being to speak with authority on the whole subject. </para>
                    <para>In the few years which preceded the last election, the previous Government endeavoured to formulate some acceptable alternative method of controlling industries. The subject was discussed also on the hustings a few months ago. It has been truly said during this debate that the result of the election seemed to indicate that the people desire a continuance of the system of dual control, although it is impossible to say whether that was the real issue on which the election turned. All sorts of cross currents intruded themselves during the campaign and obscured the issue, which shows- that the introduction of politics into industry has been a curse. It has been suggested that certain industries have become federalized; but there is not much in that contention, for, as I have said, unions that have branches in more than one State can place themselves within the federal jurisdiction without any difficulty whatever. No government can. say authoritatively that the people desire complete industrial authority to be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. This is particularly so in view of the fact that in July or August of last year there . were 420,000 employees in Australia working under Commonwealth awards and more than 600,000 working under State awards. That seems to show that the employees favour the State tribunals more than the Commonwealth Court, The statements of certain alleged industrial leaders, quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> this morning, were made for the deliberate purpose of reflecting upon the system of arbitration with a view to its ultimate destruction. Labour has consistently failed in its attitude towards arbitration, particularly at critical junctures in the industrial history of this country. Whatever may be the decision of the arbitration tribunal, I conceive it to be the duty of the political leaders of all parties and of this Parliament to support its awards. This support has not always been forthcoming. When we see a distinguished representative of the Labour party, a gentleman now occupying a position on the treasury bench, conveying resolutions of congratulation to the rank and file of the coal-miners and to the timber-workers on their splendid stand against what was described as a general attack on wages and hours of working in that industry, we can readily understand how, in its attitude towards arbitration, the political Labour party is influenced by considerations of party strategy. One prominent representative of the Labour movement declared that he endorsed heartily the action of the timber workers in striking against an award of the court. "I believe in arbitration," said this gentleman, "but not arbitration as administered by a prejudiced court." </para>

                            <para>- This is the sentiment that commands the plaudits of certain sections in the Labour movement. Apparently every award that does not give one side what it wants is prejudiced. These gentlemen, who rank high in the counsels of the Labour party, are now supporting this movement to amend the Constitution in the direction of giving this Parliament extended powers with regard to arbitration. And what of the trade unionists themselves? I have here a list of at least 70 trade unions the members of which agreed to a levy to support the timber-workers in their fight against an award of the Arbitration Court. Even that great organization which hitherto had won the respect of the people for its obedience to the court - I refer to the Australian Workers Union - made a levy of 5s. on its 160,000 members for the purpose of supporting those who were without employment, as a result of the timber workers' strike against the courts' award. Do they really want arbitration as we understand it, or do they want to have it in their own hands to say what the awards of that tribunal shall be ? Obviously they cannot have it both ways. If they stand for arbitration they must abide by the awards of the court. I have heard of organizations and individuals submitting disputes to arbitration with an umpire, but firmly believing that the function of the arbitrator was to support their claim. This is an entire misconception of the functions of an arbitrator.  His  duty is to make awards according to the evidence placed before him and according to what he thinks to be right in the circumstances. </para>

                        referred to the misrepresentations indulged in during the last election campaign by responsible, or perhaps I should say, irresponsible, industrial leaders with regard to arbitration. Apparently, they were prepared then to do everything in their power to injure the system, and, in fact, to abolish it altogether. It is unfortunate that the responsible members of the party now in office did not, at the time, take these industrial leaders to task. These people, it seems now, support the Government in asking for this extension of power to legislate with reference to wages and conditions of labour in industry. But this amendment will not mean peace in industry. The time of the industrial leaders would be better occupied in endeavouring to localize disputes and to bring about a better feeling between employers and employees. I am aware, of course, that there are those in the community who do not want to see a better feeling between the two sections in industry. The Bruce-Page Government endeavoured to constitute a Peace conference, but for political considerations the representatives of one section withdrew from that gathering, and the efforts of the Government to ensure peace in industry proved unavailing. The statements quoted by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline>
                        this morning indicate clearly how the system of arbitration is viewed by certain sections of trade unionists. In 1926 the Bruce-Page  Government asked for extended power to make it possible for the Arbitration Court to function more efficiently. I ilo not propose to delay the Senate by emphasizing the difference between the proposals then made and those now before this chamber. This has been done by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline>
                        I have always regarded the intrusion of political considerations into the industrial affairs of this country as one of our chief curses. Industry should not become the plaything of any political party. When the welfare' of the nation is obscured by party considerations it is impossible for our arbitration machinery to work efficiently.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline>
                        has assured us that he and all the members of this Government arc anxious to perfect the existing machinery. I am afraid that our difficulties will be added to by the Constitutional amendments contemplated in this proposal and that we shall have a further intrusion of political considerations into the industrial arena. When statements detrimental to the principle of arbitration were being made prominent members of the party opposite had not the courage to denounce those industrial leaders who were responsible for them. On the contrary, some Labour candidates endorsed them because of the political value to them of that section which was in revolt against the law. It is a highly undesirable state of affairs, but still it exists. There is no getting away from the fact that these things have happened, and I suggest to the Government that the position will become worse if, by any unhappy chance, these powers that, are sought by the Government; are granted to it. One outstanding feature in connexion with the bril is an omission from it. There is in it no proposal to ask for power to control trade unions. It is essential that where the industrial power lies there shall also lie the power to control the trade unions of this country. The great industrial organizations to which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline>
                        has referred are the bodies that approach the Arbitration Court for awards, and I suggest that there should not only be judicial control' over them while they are before the court, but that their internal affairs, sUCh as finance, forms of rules and secret ballots should be regulated, and we should have power to prevent the tyranny -which is now exercised by certain union leaders over their own members. The regulation of the unions in that way would give the rank and file a proper say in the control of. their organizations. That, in many respects is not the case to-day, and 1 suggest that something in the nature of a secret ballot should be prescribed. The position of Australia to-day in regard to trade union control is the most lamentable in the world. The control of trade unions in Great Britain is placed in the hands of the Registrar-General of friendly societies. From an examination of the affairs of trade unions in the interests of the trade union movement itself, emerged a number of things which are summarized in an article which appeared in the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Quarterly Review</inline>
                        of October, 1926. The article, although somewhat florid in places, gives the pith of the inquiry. It reads -

                        <para>There is a flutter in the dovecotes of trade union officialism. Well-paid prosperous gentlemen who have done very well out of the contributions of the rank and file, are much perturbed because certain members of Parliament, by asking the Minister of Labour pertinent questions relating to trade union funds and their disbursement, have turned the glaring light of publicity on the extremely heavy working expenses of some of the most important organizations. It is all very well for Labour M.P.'s, themselves well-paid union officials, to say that the information could  easily  have been obtained from the annuall? returns of  the  Registrar-General of Friendly Societies. No doubt the questioners were well aware of that - probably they had already read those returns - and did not need the information for themselves, the object being to give the matter the widest possible publicity. </para>

The newspaper already referred to is strangely silent on these " excellent " ways of incurring working expenses from moneys provided" by the hard earned pence of the rank and file.

                    <para class="block">The article then proceeds to set out the figures, which betray an extraordinary state of affairs. While the total receipts have decreased, the total expenditure in respect of management, salaries, and allowances to various officers, has increased. The defalcations which were analysed and examined in 1923-24, have reached an alarming figure. Are we, who claim to represent the people of this country, to allow an opportunity like this to pass without making provision in this legislation for some control of the trade union movement, its funds, management, rules and organizations? This power is to my mind fundamental to the settlement of the whole industrial problem. </para>

Unless this legislation includes the power of control of these trade unions, of what use is it likely to be? It would lead to the criticism to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has already referred. There would be no control over the rules, the funds, the management, or the ballots of the trade unions. If a secret ballot were permitted how many of the union leaders, who now preen themselves as the mouth-piece of the unions, would remain in that position? It is only by instilling sheer fear into and exercising harsh tyranny upon their members that they are able to occupy their positions.

                        <para>There is one general secretary in receipt of £1,000 per annum salary, whose parliamentary and other public duties prevent his giving much time to his secretarial duties. Fortunately, a large staff, supervised by a competent private secretary, are able to do all the work with some degree of efficiency. He is by no means the only general secretary getting £1,000 a year. During the war the salary of another secretary - which varied with the fluctuations of the members' wages - rose to more than £3,000 per annum. This official also has large interests in a flourishing business. </para>
                        <para class="block">There are many others whose salary approximates £1,000. Just prior to the recent general strike, the general secretary of one of the big unskilled unions, already receiving £750 per annum, applied to his executive for an increase to £1,000, which would probably have been granted had the strike not then happened. After a ten days' strike, this union found itself unable, through lack of funds, to meet its obligations to its members. The salaries of the officials were, however, continued. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the short period of three years the trade union funds were thus reduced by about £6,200,000, and there was a drop in membership of 2,600,000. With the aid of the balance-sheets submitted to the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, the <inline font-style="italic">Morning Post</inline> attempted to ascertain where the money had gone. Attention was first directed to the matter in British trade union circles in 1921, but. when the dwindling membership and finances and the higher ratio of managerial expenses were brought to the attention of the unions the latter made no attempt to furnish an explanation. The <inline font-style="italic">Morning Post</inline> accused them of extravagance. Still no reply was forthcoming. </para>
                    <para>At this stage I should like to draw attention to the figures taken from the preliminary report of the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies for 1923 published in November, 1924, showing in round figures the growth and decline of trade union membership from 1912 to 1923 inclusive, and the marked increase in the proportion of management expenses. A whole series of unions is taken and the figures are very illuminating. In 1922 the number of agricultural workers in the unions was 90,643 and their income was £37,287 ; managerial expenses amounted to £37,556. In 1923 the membership had dropped to 79,707 but the income had increased to £38,549 ; the managerial expenses were £22,276. In the paper-making and printing trade in 1922the membership was 129,580; the income £472,745, and the managerial expenses £104,815. In 1923 the membership was 130,515, the income £434,211, and the managerial expenses £101,501. The cost of administration in both years was nearly 25 per cent. of the total income. The mining and quarrying unions had in1922, 759,286 members and their income was £1,921,235. In 1923 the membership had increased to 822,913, and the income had dropped to £1,713,385. In the former year the managerial expenses were £414,869 and in 1923, £404,528. The transport unions show a shocking disproportion of managerial expenses to subscriptions. In 1922 the membership was 562,947, the income £1,020,600, and the managerial expenses £574,966. The figures in 1923 were: membership, 600,533 ; income, £927,242 ; and expenses, £503,243. In both years the expenses of management were more than 50 per cent. of the total income. It is obvious from these figures that there is a tremendous wastage in connection with trade union management in the Old Country. </para>

                            <para>In 1918 management expenses had increased to £2,100,000. Assume, if you will, that that is a fair figure. Very well. But what about 1923, when the membership had decreased by roughly 20 per cent., income from members had increased by more than 25 per cent., and management expenses had increased by more than 50 per cent? Or, to make it clearer still, the affairs of 5,250,000 trade unionists cost, in 1918, £2,100,000 to manage, while in 1923 the affairs of 4,360,000 members involved management expenses of £3,200,000. </para>

                        <para>I now turn to the paragraph dealing with the defalcations of trade unions. This is a very difficult problem with which the unions have to grapple. If the eye of the public, in the form of the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies or a similar official, were granted sufficiently wide powers to deal with the matter it would be better for the trade union movement and for the rank and file of the unions. This is an extract from the report of the Registrar - " In some instances suggestions from this office have resulted in security being obtained or the amount of the guarantee being increased. " Defalcations involving heavy losses, however, are still brought to light. The union referred to in the 1921 report as showing deficencies amounting to £2,063 wrote off a further sum at £1,650, in 1922. " In another case the treasurer, who had given no security, misappropriated £108, and was subsequently sentenced to four months' imprisonment. A branch secretary in another union who misappropriated £121 was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. In another case £120 was stolen from the house of a branch treasurer, and as the culprit could not bo found the amount had to be written off. "The number of auditors' special reports was comparatively small. Where, however, a special report was made, it was usually by a professional accountant, and of an exhaustive character.

                        <para class="block">There is evidence, at all events, of the benefit that trade unions would get if such an examination were carried out by the Chief Registrar. When these disclosures were originally made the unions took considerable umbrage at their nature, and a conference was called somewhere in the South of England by the union leaders to debate the subject. It was attended by some men whose names are well known in this country. A curious attitude was taken by some of the delegates, one of whom declared that the attacks " are quite beside the mark," that the " benefits were, after all, an exceptional thing - valuable but incidental, and a trade union could exist witheut anything but a strike fund." Another advocated that the trade unions give point blank refusals to supply the figures to the Registrar, and let the Government do its worst. That seems to me to be the policy adopted in this country. So far as I can see there is no attempt at compliance with the trade union law. If there were it would be ineffectual and would give this Parliament no power in the matter at all. At that conference it was suggested that the whole attack was inspired, but the facts remain and the occurrence has been repeated. It was found necessary to embark on a " back to the union " movement, as the trade union movement in Great Britain suffered to the extent of 1,000,000 members in a very short time. That effort was not satisfactory and endeavours were made in some quarters, I do not say by the high officials, to justify the managerial expenditure to which I have referred, and also certain other losses to which I have made reference. </para>
                        <para>In this excellent article appears a comparison of the development of the movement between 1918 and 1923. Honorable senators may fairly draw the inference that we are of the same race; indeed, that we are practically the same people as those managing the affairs of trade unions on the other side of the water. I do not think that we can expect any greater efficiency or honesty from those in charge of the affairs of trade unions in Australia. After all is said and done, why should a body of such magnitude, in point of numbers, and with such tremendous financial interests as the trade union movement go without any proper form of control? I submit that this bill should contain some provision to that effect, if it is to be workable. There must be that control over employees' and employers' organizations such as was visualized in the amendment to which I have referred. I have indicated what has already been done overseas and, in reply to an interjection, I have intimated that recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Buckland addressed some very pointed remarks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jock</inline> Garden concerning an amount of ?3,000 which was contributed by the Australian Workers Union for the purpose of assisting the timber workers' strike. I have seen no explanation in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buckland's</inline> inquiry, and assume that some arrangement has been made to the satisfaction of those concerned. </para>

I am not blaming the rank and file of the trade union movement, who have little to say in this matter. Take the two cases, which must be fresh in honorable senator's minds, having been reported in the press this week, showing the absolute tyranny of these official aristocrats of trade unionism. It was reported in the press yesterday that, at Hobart, two men, employed under the terms of an award had done something in the nature of not working after their ordinary hours of employment had terminated. They refused to do so, and were brought before the court. Their defence was that if they had gone on, the union threatened to fine them ?3; but they were fined by the court for not obeying its direction to continue work. The threat by the union was made in flagrant defiance of the terms of an award. It was a case similar to one mentioned in the House of Representatives last week, in which an employee of the taxpayers of this country was threatened by his union with a fine unless he divulged information which it was his duty not to give, unless with the consent of the head of his department. I am glad to know that certain action is to be taken with regard to this position. Rules such as these are bringing the trade unions into bad odour with the community. We are allowing a tyranny, such as the world has never known, to be built up by these petty men, who, after all, are put into their positions by the rank and file of the great trade union movement. In Sydney, recently, there was an incident somewhat similar to that in Hobart, and I understand that the men have been punished by the union. There was a shortage of labour on a vessel, and the workmen concerned went out on the ship. For doing this each of them has been debarred by the union from earning his living for a period of six months. Union officials responsible for actions of that kind are the autocrats that we desire to control, and, if such control could be exercised, there would be less internal strife in Australia than there is to-day. </para></talk.start><para>Reviewing for a moment the present operation of compulsory arbitration, in regard to those who, unfortunately, owing to economic conditions, are unable to obtain employment, it is obvious that the Government must seriously consider whether some measure of relief cannot be given. The present legislation is preventing a free flow of charity in many cases in which work could otherwise be given. I venture to say that it is better to provide a man with work of some kind than to hand him a dole. Employment enables him to maintain a certain degree of self-respect that he cannot have if payment is made to him by way of charity. Arbitration awards have operated in such a way in Queensland that, in order to get over the unemployment difficulty, some of the awards have had to be suspended, and I understand that one of them was the rural workers' award. There is no such provision under federal legislation, and I do not think that it would be welcomed by some of those who stand for arbitration. I myself have stood for arbitration for many years, and </para><para class="block">I know the great difficulties experienced in putting it into operation. The system is not elastic enough to deal with problems such as those with which we are now faced. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> has said that it would be absurd to suggest that Parliament should deal with wages and hours of employment, and in that view I entirely agree with him. But in his next breath, he said that he would not give the judiciary power to determine wages and hours of employment. He said that the fate of the country would be in the hands of the judges and that they were not to be entrusted with those powers. If Parliament is not to exercise them, and the judiciary is not to do it, are we to have a go as you please system? I can only conceive that what the Minister has in his mind is some system of committees, and I venture to suggest that this Parliament will find it rather difficult, from a constitutional point of view, to legislate in that way. The machine that the Minister desires to build will be found very difficult to construct, and if he succeeded in establishing it, I think that the court itself would have trouble in carrying on its operations within its constitutional limitations. </para><para>I had intended to say something about certain aspects of the industrial legislation of this country. Without reflecting on any government, either that with which I was recently associated or the Ministry now in power, I put it broadly that, if we are to have a rule of law, let us have it ; and the only effective rule of law that I know to have been enacted in this country in regard to industrial arbitration is the Transport Workers Act. Rigid, as my friends may think it to be - its administration, after all, can make it or mar it - the fact remains that, it has proved an effective piece of industrial legislation. I grant that it may be attended with certain cruel results, but, if we fall short of a rule of law, we shall have conciliation pure and simple, and no penalties. Then we shall be forced back to the system of tooth and claw, to which the Minister referred the other evening. After all, I do deplore the fact that these referendum proposals have been brought forward. I indicated to the Government and to the Leader of the House, when I was speaking on the Power  of Amendment Bill, that I think that this is no time to introduce these measures. The nation is passing through a period of stress, and the people will be divided on the questions to be submitted to them. There is conflict even in the ranks of the supporters of the Government, and there is a division of opinion between those two conflicting elements and the Opposition in regard to what' should be done. If any good is to be secured by arbitration, it will be brought about only by some of the industrial leaders on each side, guided, it may be,  by Ministers and members of the Opposition, sitting round a table and evolving a system giving us a permanent working scheme that will secure industrial peace for Australia. This result can never be achieved by means of measures that are forced through Parliament, such as those providing for the powers for which Ministers now ask. For the reasons that other honorable senators have advanced,  and  for the other reasons that I have given, I shall vote against the second reading of this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2151</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYB</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNN, James Patrick Digger</name><name role="display">Senator DUNN</name></talker><para>. - I have listened with a great deal of interest to the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> ' and other honorable senators.

In this connexion I recall the timber-workers' strike, in which approximately 12,000 men were engaged and which ultimately resulted in considerable hardship upon not only the members of the timber-workers union, but also the women and children dependent upon them. During industrial troubles people have sometimes said to me, " Why are your people on strike again, Dunn ?" I always ask such persons if they have considered why the men are on strike. Do they think that the 12,000 timber-workers went on strike merely for the sake of striking? During industrial disturbances of that kind the men are not only without wages, but they are dependent upon their fellow trades unionists for food and clothing. I deny most emphatically the suggestion that men go out on strike merely because they do not wish to work or because they have a petty grievance. Prior to the timber-workers' dispute the men were enjoying a 44-hour week; but as the result of a variation of an arbitration court award their hours were increased from 44 to 48 a week and their wages reduced by 18s. a week. Will anyone say that those men were not justified in ceasing work? During that long strike I went on the platform night after night for many weeks, to advocate the claims of those men and I am not in the least ashamed of the action which I took dur ing that terrific struggle. Men possessing courage and determination and with a knowledge of what is fair should not have been asked to submit to such an award.

My mind carries me back to the time when the unionists of Australia looked to the day when a system of arbitration would bring peace to industry. We looked to it to bring about the fulfilment of the words of the great philosopher who said, " The labourer is worthy of his hire." To a great extent Labour has achieved that object. Arbitration brought about the abolition of individual bargaining between employer and employee. In the " good old days " to which honorable senators opposite so frequently refer, those days when there was no Arbitration Court, negotiations between labour and those who employed labour were carried out on the individual bargaining system. There was frequently no union to protect workers. Men offered their services, not for what they thought would keep them, but for what they thought would enable them to secure preference over others who would be offering their services at the same time. As a matter of fact, the same system is in operation to-day. The greatest protection to the worker is a buoyant labour market. A keen demand for labour is protection for labour, but in periods of depression like the present, the worker cannot protect himself. If an employer were to advertise for 10,000 men at 7s. a day for work not covered by an arbitration award, men would trample each other down to secure the positions offering. There are  now  about 200,000 unemployed in Australia. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2157</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">OGDEN, James</name><name role="display">Senator Ogden</name></talker><para>-  And the number is increasing. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2157</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOARE, Albert</name><name role="display">Senator HOARE</name></talker><para>- I am afraid it will increase for a little while, but if nature is kind enough to give us anything like a good harvest, there will be better conditions all round. Honorable senators opposite have said that there are workers who break the arbitration laws. I think it safe to say that 95 per cent. of the workers who are working under arbitration awards obey them and carry on their work peacefully - that those who kick over the traces and from time to time cause disturbances do not represent more than 5 per cent. Strange to say, both the extreme conservatist employer, anxious to take advantage of an over supplied labour market, and the extreme industrialist say, " away with arbitration ". How any person who claims to be a good unionist can say that we should be better off without arbitration is beyond my comprehension. What would be the state of affairs if there were no arbitration courts in Australia? What wages would be paid? What would be the conditions of labour? With 200,000 men unemployed the power of unionism would be swept aside. If there were no arbitration awards men would offer their services practically for bread and butter. Many are almost doing that now. Quite a number come to my house and ask for a dinner and a couple of shillings, in return for which they undertake to trim my lawn and attend to my garden. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2157</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">OGDEN, James</name><name role="display">Senator Ogden</name></talker><para>-  Does, the honorable senator take them at their word? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2157</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOARE, Albert</name><name role="display">Senator HOARE</name></talker><para>- I do not. Recently a man accosted me in Adelaide and said, " Look here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, can</inline> you give me a day's work ?" I replied that I did not have anything for him to do. He said, " I want a pair of boots and should be obliged if you would give me a day's work. I could come down and do your lawn." I replied, " Very well," and named the following Saturday for the work. When I asked him what wages he needed he said that he would leave it to me, so I offered him 15s. for the  day, also his dinner and tea. As I was walking away he called after me,. " Oh, by the way, how am I going to get to your place?" I gave him ls. for his fare and I have not seen him since! Fortunately, there are very few like him. Many good, men are willing to come along and work for almost nothing, on the assumption that half a loaf is better than no bread. Fortunately, unionism prevents that sort of thing in industry. Awards are promulgated, and they determine the rates of pay in Australian industry. No person is allowed to come along and undercut those wages. Employees are protected by the law; they appreciate the power and the beneficent effects of unionism and grasp it with both hands, determined to retain it for ever. Unionism is one of the greatest boons ever granted to the people "of this country, and the arbitration law is amongst the finest humanitarian laws of the country. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2158</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KLU</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GLASGOW, William</name><name role="display">Senator Sir William Glasgow</name></talker><para>- Industrial arbitration has been abused. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2158</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOARE, Albert</name><name role="display">Senator HOARE</name></talker><para>- I grant that our industrial act is not a perfect piece of machinery. There has been only one perfect Individual in this world, and He was crucified. I recognize that no man-made law is perfect and that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act has its faults. But as a contrast to it my mind goes back to the " Good old days " when bargaining for labour existed. Men who were driving lorries between Adelaide and Port Adelaide, knew the time at which they should start in the morning, but they never knew when they would cease work at night. I have seen them driving their teams home after eleven o'clock at night and in the most atrocious weather, subjected to the buffeting of the winter rain, but never in receipt of overtime. They dared not complain, as they had no organization behind them to support their just claims. Unionism and arbitration have prevented that sort of thing. Arbitration has baulked the unscrupulous employer of his prey. The honest employer has nothing to fear from arbitration. </para></talk.start></continue><para>A good deal of criticism has been levelled against federal arbitration by the workers because of its tardiness and costliness. Some unions have had to wait years for their cases to be heard by the court. That is not right. Their complaints should be heard expeditiously and cheaply. I remember one union having to pay £6,000 merely to obtain a decision as to whether it could approach the court on a certain issue. Eventually it found its own way of settling the dispute. I refer to the Tramway Union of South Australia. Beginning with the basic wage it approved of a sliding scale of pay, varying with the cost of living, and that scheme has proved very successful. There has 'been no trouble in the union for a number of years. It is problematical whether the principle could be employed extensively. </para><para>I think that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> who said that arbitration had not abolished strikes. I do not think that anything will. Despite all restrictions men, smarting from a sense of injustice, will occasionally kick over the traces and lay down their tools. But it must also be remembered that arbitration has not prevented lockouts. It is just as imperative to prevent the one as it is to avoid the other. I have no objection to a secret ballot. In my humble opinion it is the proper instrument to employ in emergencies, and I think that it is the right thing for unionism. It gives an honest majority one way or the other, a decision by which men will probably stand firm. We boast about our splendid principle of electing members of Parliament by secret ballot. Certainly that is one of the grandest privileges conferred upon any community and if the principle is right in connexion with parliamentary representation it should be right in regard to industrial disputes. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2158</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator should endeavour to convert the union 'leaders to that point of view. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2158</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOARE, Albert</name><name role="display">Senator HOARE</name></talker><para>- The Bruce-Page Government introduced a law which insists upon compulsory secret ballots.

Men who are now Ministers of the Crown urged the workers to disobey, awards of the Arbitration Court. They promised that they would stand behind the men if they stuck to their union principles. After twelve months of suffering the men were compelled to accept conditions which they could have had at the beginning. Their acceptance came too late. The industry in which they were engaged has gone for the time being, and other industries more or less dependent on it have also gone. I could name a dozen industries which to-day are unable to employ as many men as they did at the beginning of the timber-workers' strike.

That doctrine is said to be one of the fundamental principles of trade unionism. The trade unionism so greatly lauded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> was, at the time of its inauguration in Australia, a magnificent thing. There is no similarity between the trade unionism of that day and the so-called trade unionism of the present time. Early trade unionism in Australia had as its object the improvement of conditions of unionists and the rendering of service to the community. The position is entirely different to-day. So soon as a worker attempts to give his best to the community, by doing an honest day's work, he is penalized by his union. The official organs of many trade unions record, not by dozens, or even by scores, but by hundreds, the names of men who have been fined for having done what any decent man would do. Is that carrying out the principles of trade unionism? The result of the preaching of that pernicious doctrine is that Australia lacks an army of well trained, efficient workers. Young men of promise, who entered industry ten or fifteen years ago, and were capable of doing something for the good of their fellows, have been kept down to the level of men who had neither the ability nor the ambition to rise. Although Australian workmen, if left alone, are willing and able to do more than they are now doing, the cost of practically every commodity manufactured in Australia has increased to such an extent that prices have far exceeded a rate which the average person can afford to pay. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2161</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1Z</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RAE, Arthur</name><name role="display">Senator Rae</name></talker><para>- That is mainly due to the greed of the employers. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2161</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para>- It is due largely to the policy of dragging good men down to the level of less competent workers. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2161</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>- Do honorable senators opposite contend that a federal arbitration system such as they propose will prevent that? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2161</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para>- I do not think they can.

When I asked him why he should make such an assertion he said that, although he was a young man and capable of making considerable progress in the trade in which he was engaged, he was not permitted to do more than a certain quantity of work. One of the main causes of the present unsatisfactory industrial situation is the preponderance of industrial legislation, and I cannot see how the granting of additional industrial powers to the federal authority will help in overcoming the difficulties with which we are faced. We have heard of the varying conditions in a particular industry as between States, but it appears to me that a common rule would be the downfall of the industry to which it was applied.

Nothing could prevent that course being followed. I recall what occurred in Queensland a good many years ago when, in defiance of the will of the people, the Labour party abolished the Upper Chamber in that State. The Labour party then gerrymandered the electorates and commenced public works in Nationalist electorates so that additional Labour votes could be secured to ensure the return of Labour candidates. Although a majority of the electors supported the Nationalist policy, there was no power to check the Government.

Australia, before any other country, has ever cherished the delusion that for every ill there is a political remedy, and we have been prone to act on those lines. I do not propose to deal at length with the vexed question of industrial legislation. At the recent federal elections, the main issue was the distribution of industrial powers between the Commonwealth and the States, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has so ably  pointed out, 101 issues were dragged in at that election in order to obscure the main issue. As the late Government's proposals were rejected, it is useless to dwell upon them at great length, but a great deal of confusion appeared to exist, particularly in connexion with arbitration as a principle and the Federal Arbitration  Court.  For instance, the proposals of the late Government were not based on any idea of abolishing arbitration, as was so persistently asserted by Labour candidates on the hustings, but simply provided for the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from the sphere of non-maritime industries, which we're to be dealt with by the States under their arbitration or other industrial legislation. Although those proposals were rejected, I am still of the opinion that they are sound, and that Australia will eventually come to our way of thinking. The States should, I contend, be permitted to control conditions of employment in the industries within the States without interference by the central Government. </para></talk.start><para>I should like to read the majority recommendation from the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution in relation to the vexed question of industrial powers. On page 248 of that  report,  I find the following: - </para><quote><para>We do hot recommend that the Commonwealth Parliament be empowered' to legislate with respect to industrial matters generally. </para><para>In our opinion, the reasons which may be urged against the abolition of the federal and the establishment of a unitary system of government in Australia may be urged against the transfer of this power to the Commonwealth. In our opinion, industrial legislation should be regarded as a function of the States. In many matters industrial legislation is experimental, and each State should decide for itself whether it is prepared to test the value of proposed legislation of this character and to accept the responsibility for its consequences. We also think that industrial legislation peculiarly requires local supervision, and should be in the hands of the authority which is responsible for the maintenance of law and for the good order of the community. We think, further, that the general power to legislate with respect to industrial matters should be in the hands of the legislature which has the general power to deal with health, trade and commerce, mines, lands, public works, and the development of a State. We do not think that it  Would  be for the good of Australia that the Commonwealth Parliament should be occupied with industrial questions or that the federal elections should turn on industrial issues. </para></quote><para class="block">We can imagine circumstances in which a federal election turned on an industrial issue, and the over bidding for votes. The last election was bad enough, but it would be almost impossible to conceive the preposterous outbidding and  outpromising  that would arise if this Parliament had power to deal with the rates of pay, hours and conditions of labour in industry. We should have the candidates representing one party promising a working week of 44 hours and the representatives of another party advocating 40 hours. The thing is perfectly preposterous and unsound. Frankly I have no faith or belief in compulsory arbitration, just as I do not believe in compulsory voting, because the objective is impossible of attainment. It may be possible by law to compel a man to go to the poll just as it is possible to compel a horse to go to water; but it is as impossible to make a man vote as it is to compel a horse to drink. </para><para>Compulsory arbitration has been tried in only two countries - Australia and New Zealand - and in my considered judgment the experiment has proved most disastrous for both the worker and the general community. Compulsory arbitration and compulsory voting are equally repugnant to me because of my inherent belief in the absolute freedom of the individual. Many years ago compulsory arbitration was described by one of its judicial administrators as a Serbonian bog. I have not had much personal knowledge of bogs, but I can well imagine that to be in a Serbonian bog would be a particularly terrifying experience. In those far away days no competent critic would quarrel with His Honour's definition, because its essential truth was obvious. To-day the industrial position of the Commonwealth is far worse. It may be described as a bottomless pit. Our arbitration system was devised and the court established to make for peace in industry in Australia and to facilitate the industrial and economic expansion of the nation. But what has happened? In its legal sense arbitration court proceedings have become a vast quicksand in which industries are being suffocated; in its social sense it is a manufacturer of industrial war and social discontent, and in its economic sense it has proved to be the emasculator of the working capital of the community. It produces endless solemn judicial awards which are either habitually and contemptuously violated or simply ignored by many sections of the community. Many of these solemn judgments and determinations are rendered futile by the resistless and inexorable operation of natural economic laws. We may provide legislatively for industrial arbitration regardless of economic effects of judicial awards, but these age-old economic laws are inescapable. </para><para>We poor, deluded and benighted Australians maintain this absurd system, with all the mischief it has caused and is causing, simply because it is a pawn in the game of party politics. Look where we will we cannot find any friends of the Federal Arbitration Court. All its former lovers have jilted it. Now it is distrusted, despised and detested and its awards flouted and abused. It is spuriously represented as a great humanizing, philanthropic machine; whereas in truth it has been an unmitigated curse to this country. It has had a very grave demoralizing influence on our people. As a demoralizing agency it has exceeded, in its proven potency, any legislative experiment that has ever been carried out in any country or time. It has succeeded in infecting a great mass of our working population with a mental and social disease which may bring Australia to destruction. By this I mean the manifestation which expresses itself in massed lawlessness, the violation of all legal contracts which the mob thinks irksome, and a contemptuous refusal to obey the laws of the land. </para><para>If this proposed amendment is accepted by the people, Parliament will itself become an industrial tribunal; but if supporters of the bill believe that this will mean peace in industry they are making a grievous and terrible mistake. I tremble to think what sort of place this Parliament will become under those conditions. Compulsory arbitration has had a long and very fair trial. It has abolished industrial peace and sanity from the land, and in its place has put a bludgeon in the hands of unscrupulous people. Now it is proposed to appeal to the country for an extension of the powers of this industrial plague. Nothing short of its total abolition can cure the ills with which the system of compulsory arbitration has saddled this country. It is time, and high time, that we had done with it before it saps the vitality and independence of the rising as it has impaired the independence of the present generation. But its end is not yet. Even now legislation is contemplated to bolster it up. I believe, however, that the people of Australia are beginning to realize that economic laws cannot be flouted with impunity; that they are far stronger than any legislation ever placed on the statute-book. As a nation we have endeavoured for years to ignore these truths, and because of .a series of good seasons and high prices for our products, apparently for a time we were able to " get away " with it. But the inevitable day of reckoning is dawning at long last, and it is not made the  pleasanter  because of its long postponement. The maintenance of high wages is an ideal devoutly to be wished, but the very highest wages ever fixed by the Arbitration Court mean nothing, if there is no work available for the people engaged in the industries concerned. After having given the industrial situation in Australia the most earnest thought, I have been forced to the conclusion that our system of compulsory arbitration has been .a most potent influence in causing a great deal of the unemployment from which this country is suffering to-day. The Commonwealth </para><para>Parliament should not be occupied with the discussion of industrial matters. It is not the job of this Parliament.

No other proposed alteration of the Constitution has been placed 'before the people on so many occasions as this suggested amendment to . extend the industrial powers of this Parliament and none has been rejected so consistently by the electors. Nevertheless there is something in the contention of the Government and its supporters that since it was elected on its industrial policy, it should seek to give effect to it. Section 51 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament shall have power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in respect of, among other things, " conciliation and arbitration." At this critical stage in the history of the Commonwealth, the Government would be ill-advised to submit to the people contentious measures of this nature. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> at the opening of this Parliament appealed to all sections of the people and all parties in Parliament to come together, practically as an economic council, to devise ways and means of placing Australia in a better position than she is in to-day. In the light of that appeal the submission of this proposed amendment is extremely unwise, because undoubtedly it will divide the people of Australia into two opposing camps, and dissipate the energy and the ability so urgently required to improve the economic and financial position of this country. </para></talk.start><para>It is true that the former administration in 1926 submitted a proposal for an amendment of the industrial power. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> the proposal now before us is practically identical with that put before the people in 1926. But it takes very little consideration to come to the conclusion that there is a considerable difference be tween the two. I supported the measure brought forward by the Bruce-Page Government solely because it sought to do away with the dual control of industry, which I regard as one of the most fruitful sources of industrial trouble in Australia. That proposal, however, was not accepted by the people, and it is known, of course, that the late Government went to the country last year with a somewhat similar scheme for the single control of industry. It is claimed by the opponents of the late Government, that is to say, by the present Government, that the people at the last elections declared solidly against the proposal of the late Government, but with all due respect to the people, I very much dispute the statement that that was the issue upon which the election was decided. There were so many other issues of great importance and so many others magnified to first-class importance by persons interested in getting the election to swing in a certain direction, that many voters lost sight of the real issue, while the great majority of those who had their minds focussed on the real issue, had a wrong conception of what was meant by the late Government's proposal. It was said by the opponents of that Government to be an attack upon the arbitration system of Australia, whereas it was merely an honest effort to bring that system within workable limits. </para><para>If this debate has done nothing else, it has brought forward some of the most remarkable arguments I have ever heard and also a new word, or at any rate, a word new to the debates in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> spoke of the " regimentation " of men in industry.

I agree most heartily with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that there has been far too much Government interference in industry in Australia. That applies not only to the Commonwealth but also to the States. It has done more to sap initiative than anything else. When people do not know what Government interference will be brought to bear on the industry in which they are engaged, it prevents not only initiative, but also expansion, and hampers and cripples the efforts of those who are engaged in an attempt to develop Australian trade and commerce. There are functions which the Government alone can perform, but those engaged in the ordinary trade and commerce of the country should within reasonable limits be allowed to carry on free from interference. I think the people of Australia have become heartily tired of this restrictive business. The ten commandments have not more "Thou shalt not's" in them than have the laws of Australia. Men can be prosecuted for working but no man is ever prosecuted for not working, and it seems to me that the sooner we get out of that position, the better. </para><para>If there is any doubt about the meaning of the proposed alteration to the Constitution, I think the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan,</inline> the Attorney-General, at a conference held here last night, clearly sets out the intentions of the Government.

There is no doubt in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan</inline> that those proposals mean unification, and nothing else. I say, without hesitation, that those who believe in unification should support them, but all who have the least doubt on the point should take the safe course and vote against them. </para><para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was reported, in the press, to have said some thing rather severe about the Senate having delayed these measures. If the right honorable gentleman was correctly reported, he was very unfair. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> pointed out this morning, the Senate has not unduly delayed the passage of these three bills. Only two honorable senators have been granted an extension of time when speaking on them, and I believe that in each case the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> moved that the extension should be granted. On every occasion on which there has been an adjournment of the debate, the desire for it emanated from the Government side of the chamber. It is grossly unfair and uncalled for to imply that the Senate has unduly prolonged the passing of these measures. Now that the matter has been made public in the press, I shall venture to prophesy that these bills will be delayed by the Government, and that the referendum will not be submitted to the people until after the New South Wales State election takes place - for very obvious reasons. My attitude towards this bill is the same as it was in regard to that dealing with the power of amendment bill. When the time comes, my advice to the people of my State will be to take the safe road and not to surrender to the Commonwealth any more power than it now possesses. </para><para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM</inline>GLASGOW (Queensland) [5.3]. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> referred to the fact that New Zealand pioneered the establishment of an industrial arbitration court. .1 point out that Australia is the only other country that has experimented with arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. The fact that no other country has attempted to regulate industrial conditions in this way indicates that the experiment has not been regarded with any favour by the rest of the world as a solution of the problem with which, it attempts to deal. </para><para>Some honorable senators have said that the present proposals of the Government in regard to arbitration are similar to those advanced by the Bruce-Page Government in 1926. I submit that they differ absolutely in nature. The 1926 proposals set out to establish authorities to regulate wages, hours of labour, and conditions of employment in industry. The idea was to take to the Commonwealth absolute power under those proposals. That would have meant a federal authority which would regulate wages, hours, and conditions of labour, and the abolition of dual control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> has very clearly  stated that if the proposals of this Government are agreed to the industrial powers taken over by the Commonwealth will be as complete as human genius could devise. In addition to dealing with wages, hours, and conditions of labour, the Commonwealth would have power to legislate over the whole of the industrial field, including such matters as. i.workers' compensation and shop and factories administration. The last two activities have been very efficiently carried on by the States, and it is obvious that decentralization in those matters is likely to give greater satisfaction than a centralized authority. I am confident that no honorable senator would seriously suggest that the Commonwealth should take over workers' compensation and shop and factories legislation, and am, therefore, opposed to this proposal to legislate over the whole industrial field. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>suggested that the approval of this bill would bring about uniform conditions throughout the Commonwealth. Why this insistence upon uniformity? It is impracticable for all States to be placed on the same basis. For instance, Queensland might be able to grant wages and conditions that could not obtain in Tasmania, due to the relative lack of resources in the latter State. Again, have the unions always sought uniformity ? I recall that in the pastoral industry, the employees of which are mostly members of the Australian Workers Union, if it was thought more advantageous to apply to the State Arbitration Court that would be done. Later on the opposite step might be taken, and an appeal made to the Federal Court. The advantages accruing governed the action of the union. </para><para>No one would suggest that arbitration has been the unqualified success that was hoped for by its sponsors. The reason for that is the dual control that exists, with its attendant disadvantages, such as conflicting awards, multiplicity of awards, and " rival shop." New Zealand, with its one authority to deal with industrial arbitration, has had much more beneficial results than Australia. I am confident that, instead of ushering in peace in industry, arbitration has introduced industrial unrest, and frequently has brought about chaos in industry. Australia is at present going through a very difficult time, but these proposals cannot lessen its difficulties. </para><para>I was rather interested in an extract read by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Anderson's work, <inline font-style="italic">Fixation of Wages in Australia,</inline> to this effect - ' </para><para>Time is no denying that we have a conglomeration of industrial legislation existing in the various States and the Commonwealth, and different parties are enacting alleged solutions each year. One State is  vieing  with the other to place more advanced views on the statute-book. While some of the legislation may be perfectly safe to apply to certain industries, it may be dangerous to others; nevertheless, once the legislation is there, employers bow to it, and the result is seen in the lack of harmony existing. The question is whether legislation is able to deal with such a complex matter, to provide for the minute details to cover practically every movement of a man, and to limit the capacity to which he can be subjected. In attempting to carry out these things, I believe we are usurping the functions of mutual goodwill by a method of compulsion which is inimical to the spirit of co-operation.

This bill will not rid us of dual control, nor will it bring about that co-ordination and uniformity of which honorable senators have spoken. During the last election campaign the present Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr.Forde), when addressing a meeting of railway men at Rockhampton, said that he believed in the two systems of arbitration, for it meant that when the workers could not get all they desired from one they could go to the other.

There has been considerable discussion as to the effect which this measure, if passed, would have on the arbitration laws of this country. Various opinions, both for and against arbitration, have been quoted. At the beginning of this session the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> said that the Opposition recognized that the election had, above all things, hinged on arbitration, and that the electors had given the new Government a mandate to amend the arbitration laws. He said that, so far as arbitration and kindred subjects were concerned, the Government could expect the hearty co-operation of the Opposition, which recognized that in submitting amendments to the arbitration laws the Government would be doing only what it was returned to do. I am not one of those who argue that arbitration was the only issue before the country. At every general election voters are influenced by all sorts of considerations, many of them outside the policy speech of the party which is returned to power. Nevertheless, we hear from time to time that the Labour party, while professing to favour arbitration, has broken away from it, and has condoned the actions of those who have kicked over the traces when unable to get favorable awards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> had stated that men had a right to break away from an award when it was not favorable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> 'made no statement capable of that construction being placed upon  it. What he did say was that, in the case of the timber workers' award, the lengthening of hours and the heavy reduction in wages made the award so iniquitous that there was every reasonable excuse for men breaking it. He did not say that men should break every award which is unfavorable; but he did say that when an award is actually wicked and atrocious, men are justified in not complying with it. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> in that attitude. Indeed, I go further, and say that I honour them for doing so. I came to this place on the day that I heard the news regarding the stand of the timber workers. Being unable to call in person to offer my congratulations, I sent a telegram to the timber-workers, congratulating them on having had sufficient manliness to flout such an obviously infamous award, and offering to levy myself to the extent of £1 per week to assist them. Whether they emerged from the struggle victorious or not, I say without fear of refutation, that the magnificent fight they put up, followed by the strong defence of the miners against infamous attempts to oust them from their position, prevented further attacks by other sections of employers. </para><para>When ex-Labour men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> come here with their crying tales regarding the economic position of the country, and demand that men shall accept lower wages, I say tha U the economic position of the country would be greatly improved if every one whose wages have been menaced took the bull by the horns and not only refused a reduction of wages, but demanded even better conditions. The progress of a country depends on the amount of militancy among the workers and the extent to which they are resolved to fight against attempted reductions of wages or the worsening of their conditions. We shall never improve the economic conditions of a country by a cowardly surrender to reductions when they are threatened. Such surrender can only intensify the existing evils. Honorable senators must be aware that a reduction of wages and an increase in unemployment mean a reduced purchasing power for the community as a whole, and that any further reduction of wages or employment necessarily means a widening of the circle of destitution and impoverishment. The country will indeed go to the dogs unless this dry rot  of surrender to the attacks of employers is met by firm resistance on the part of the workers. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline>quoted from an article of mine which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Pan-Pacific Worker.</inline> I stand by every word that I wrote, and point out that those who are most opposed to the constitution of the PanPacific Secretariat, which issues that journal, are only too glad to read the publication in order to try to find something with which to attack their onetime colleagues. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2169</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator Reid</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator is too obstinate to back down. </para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2169</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1Z</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RAE, Arthur</name><name role="display">Senator RAE</name></talker><para>- My attitude as set out in that article, is consistent with my present attitude towards arbitration.

But what will he say regarding his remarks eleven years later when, with sufficient experience surely to more than complete his novitiate, he took part in a May Day celebration? Can honorable senators imagine the right honorable gentleman taking part in such a revolutionary function as a May Day celebration? I ask them to mark that it was not an ordinary holiday like Good Friday, or Easter Monday, but May Day - the international working-class day. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which is sometimes facetiously described as a Labour journal, in its issue of 6th May, 1912, contained a report of a May Day speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was then a member of the Fisher Ministry. At that time I was a humble follower of that Ministry, sitting, metaphorically, at his feet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> expressed pleasure in being able to take part in the celebration. Befor.3 reading the motion submitted by him, I desire to read a resolution previously carried.

The resolution continues - the prohibition of child labour under the age of sixteen; free secondary and university education, with free requisites and meals for primary school children, with systematical medical inspection; the abolition of all election deposits, and advocates all legislation that will ameliorate the conditions of the workers, pending the reign of justice. </para></talk.start></continue><para class="block">This was followed by a further resolution, which read - </para><quote><para>That in view of antagonism of interests between employer and employed, and the use made by the capitalist class of the machinery of government, this meeting is of opinion, that strenuous efforts should be put forth in order to secure the election of workers to all representative bodies, and to give effect to these resolutions by every legitimate means, including the establishment of a Labour daily newspaper. </para></quote><para class="block">I mention this matter for the reason that we have been told that honorable senators leave one political party to join another, because the party to which they originally belonged having ceased to adhere to its original principles, it is necessary for them to seek some new alliance. But I challenge any one to prove that there has been an essential alteration in the Labour platform of those days as compared with what it is to-day. It is true that, as certain proposals have materialized and have become embodied in statuses they have automatically been deleted from the platform, but the Labour movement is still bound by the principles embodied in such statutes. As new problems arise, additional planks of our platform, designed to meet them, but embodying essentially the same principles, are framed. Therefore, honorable senators who have left the Labour party have discarded those principles which they once so strongly supported. It is possible, of course, that different courses may be followed by different people, in endeavouring to give effect to the same principles, and in doing so, some may be charged with superficial inconsistency. In referring to some of the criticisms levelled against this proposal, I have already quoted a statement, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, at the opening of this session in which, on behalf of the Opposition, he virtually promised to support any arbitration legislation in the direction now proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> expressed amazement that extremists in the Labour movement and in the employing class should meet on common ground in opposition to arbitration. There need be no amazement; the opposition of these two sections is not animated by the same motive. Those who believe that arbitration is not the best way for Labour to attain its ideals do so for two reasons. The first is because, they disapprove of the entagled mass of legalisms involved in arbitration and their objection to the idea that anything that comes within the law, although bad in principle, must, more or less, be reverenced because it is the law. The most tyrannical or vicious legal enactment must be reverenced and obeyed because it is the law. It is said that many weakly organized bodies of employees, or those which were so unorganized before arbitration was introduced, would, if the prop of arbitration were removed, fall to the ground. It is urged also that without some system of arbitration the conditions of the workers would be most deplorable, and that during periods of depression, when there is considerable unemployment, the employers would offer a mere pittance to their employees, who would be absolutely at their mercy. That is correct, and it would be most inopportune to remove something which has assisted the working class. It would he a dastardly act to deprive the workers of any protection which they are receiving under an award of the Arbitration Court or any such tribunal; but my contention' is that if we had never had arbitration the fighting and militant spirit of the workers would have been maintained, they would have been compelled to increase their strength, to resist aggression under a policy of no surrender, and so become a strong fighting force in the industrial arena. They would have gained such supreme power that instead of being condemned to economic servitude, they would have demanded a complete change in our social and economic system. I believe that despite any sufferings and hardships they might have experienced, they would have gained strength, and have been able to demand the wages and conditions to which they are justly entitled. Under the arbitration system they can retain only what they now possess, as awards of the Arbitration Court are based on the cost of living. Under this system the workers receive a fixed wage based on the price of certain commodities necessary for the sustenance of life. If prices increase, wages are also increased proportionately, and if they decline they are proportionately reduced. It was recently announced that wages of workers operating under federal awards were to be reduced from 2s. to 4s. 6d. a week. This means that under our present arbitration law the working class will never be any better off than it is to-day. It is a cumbersome system, and one which is likely to lead to increased militancy and the development of the fighting spirit. Is it not reasonable to suggest that the workers should have some prospect of improving their position in life, and that their wages should not be on a fixed basis for all time?. I have never heard employers oppose the basis upon which a living wage is fixed on these grounds. They oppose the system, because it involves a certain amount of trouble and sometimes compels them to pay that which they would in other circumstances willingly filch from the workers. To that extent our present arbitration system does afford some protection. I am not one of those who believe that pictures can be painted only in black and white, and I admit that arbitration has done some good; it has given some benefit to the weak and to an inadequately organized section of the community. </para><para>SenatorReid. - The honorable senator knows that it has done more than that. </para><para>SenatorRAE. - I disagree with the honorable senator. While it has been of some slight service in the direction that </para><para class="block"><inline font-style="italic">I</inline>have indicated, it is detrimental inasmuch as workers are compelled to accept awards, which result in reduced earnings. Some years ago when the Australian Workers Union obtained an award in a State court, it was said that an attempt would be made to defeat the award on technical grounds. The then secretary of the Australian Workers Union issued a manifesto  stat-ing  in no uncertain terms that if the pastoralists dared to raise the question of jurisdiction in order to prevent the union from approaching the court, the members of that organization would make the demands in their own way and without appealing to the court. The spirit of determination which at that time animated members of the Australian Workers Union was so widespread that if the organization had taken the course indicated, its members would have secured far greater concessions than they obtained subsequently from the Arbitration Court. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2172</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator Reid</name></talker><para>- But they would have paid a great deal for those concessions by strife and loss of time. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2172</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1Z</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RAE, Arthur</name><name role="display">Senator RAE</name></talker><para>- Nevertheless, the concessions which they would have been able to secure would have, repaid them for the effort. The pastoralists had sufficient good sense to withdraw their threatened challenge and allowed the claims to be decided by the court on their merits. The concessions, .although considerable in the aggregate, were long overdue. In view of the prosperity of the industry and the value of labour employed in it, we would have been amply justified in demanding much more than the court gave us. That leads me to this point that nearly all the concessions that were obtained from the court by the various sections of wage-earners during the first years of arbitration, were concessions which should have been granted many years earlier, if we take into consideration the prosperity of the industries concerned, the necessities of the wage-earners employed in them and the dividends which the employers were reaping from the investment of their capital. The court's awards simply meant an end or a partial end to the robbery which had been practised by exploiting employers upon the miserably paid wage-earners for many years. It was no common sight in those days to see pasty-faced women emerging from clothing factories in the city of Sydney, so tired physically, and mentally, as to be scarcely able, to reach their homes. </para></talk.start></continue><para>But prior to the establishment of the Arbitration Court those conditions were largely modified by factory legislation and other enactments. In the skilled industries men and women were taught to have a little pride in their social conditions and to consider they had some rights as human beings and citizens of a country allegedly free. By means of their various organizations they were able to demand a reasonable wage and reasonable conditions of labour. They realized that the more closely they were united, and the more they understood how an injury to one was an injury to all the more they were able to gain for all sections of the workers. With the passing of the years that spirit was becoming more widespread among them. Gradually they were perfecting their trade organizations for the amelioration of their working conditions.

There is nothing in the referendum proposal to prevent the Government from adopting the course suggested by the Bruce-Page Administration, and authorizing a tribunal to deal with the details. The amendment submitted by the Bruce-Page Administration differed from the proposal now under consideration in this way. The former Government really contemplated fettering Parliament instead of extending its powers, because it proposed to establish a tribunal to deal with industrial matters, and Parliament would have had no control over that authority. The fact that this opinion was held by the people was one reason for the defeat of that referendum. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The general belief is that the Commonwealth should have extended industrial powers and that from time to time it  should decide whether it is opportune to use those powers directly or to delegate them to some tribunal. Parliament should decide for itself and not be shackled and prevented from varying its methods as circumstances change and conditions vary. I say, therefore, that if this amendment is made, the Parliament will not be overloaded with the consideration of details concerning industrial matters. On the contrary, it will be possible to arrange for certain matters such as labour and unemployment to be dealt with by some other authority. While I do not think for a moment that all the evils that afflict us will be removed by the acceptance by the people of this proposal, it will, I believe, end the conflict which has been going on between the Commonwealth and State legislatures, and between the electors themselves as to which government instrumentality should have the greater power. There has been this conflict ever since the High Court decided that this Parliament did not possess some of the powers which the framers of the Constitution believed were vested in it when the contract was drawn up. These High Court interpretations have narrowed the scope of the federal power, and what the people believed the Commonwealth possessed. The present proposal is to try to readjust the position and rectify the balance which the High Court decisions have more or less upset. While I know (there was gross ignorance on the part of the multitude as to what was really involved in federation, the general impression was that it would reduce the cost of government by handing over to one central body, not all powers, but the principal powers necessary for the management of the nation; that it would reduce the importance and the flummery connected with State governments, and allow a much more simplified and even more useful form of local government, to be substituted in their place. That being the idea - and the opinion still exists - surely it is reasonable for the Senate, which claims to be a chamber of review, to give the people, after years of experience since the Fisher and the Hughes Governments submitted these questions in a somewhat different form, an opportunity to review the matter again and decide whether they are necessary or not. It is my belief there is an overwhelming opinion in favour of giving increased powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, which is more widespread, more sincere, and more emphatic to-day that it ever has been. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2174</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SAMPSON, Burford</name><name role="display">Senator Sampson</name></talker><para>- That may be so in New South Wales. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2174</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1Z</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">RAE, Arthur</name><name role="display">Senator RAE</name></talker><para>- I admit that I have not travelled very much recently in the other States; but if public opinion in New South Wales is any criterion of the feeling in the other States there is no doubt that these proposals will be carried by an overwhelming majority.

This is a proposal to submit a specific issue to the electors, one upon which they are justly entitled to vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated that there was an endeavour to turn Parliament into an auction room for industrial gain. I assume that he meant that people who sought election to this Parliament would promise all sorts of things that would benefit the people industrially if carried. One party might promise the electors a 30-hour or 40-hour working week, or an increase in wages. But that sort of thing has already been indulged in by this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> dealtvery trenchantly with the whole matter, and I shall not traverse the ground covered by previous speakers. During the last general election I observed that the secretary of the Nationalist party submitted to the people a proposal, endorsed by honorable senators opposite, which was distinctly in the nature of political bargaining. I recall that the Bruce-Page Government promised, if returned, to find £20,000,000 for the purpose of building homes for the people. Surely that was political bargaining. That Government knew it had no more hope of honoring its promise than of inaugurating a 30-hour week. It. has long been the custom to convert this chamber into a political auction mart.

The Labour party is asking the .people to give it full industrial power. I believe that if that power is granted it will be sufficient to enable the Federal Government to legislate industrially for all the requirements of the people, and that there will be no need for State interference. The decision of the people at the last general election was final - that the Commonwealth should control industrial affairs. In the past we have had the experience of one State arbitration court promulgating awards which differed from these of another State. For instance, the Victorian award provided for a 48-hour week, while that of New South Wales set forth a 44-hour week. I cannot understand how honorable senators opposite can remain faithful to their party and subscribe to what is taking place in New South Wales, and still say that they do not approve of political bargaining or the conversion of Parliament into an auction mart. Despite its election promise that it would not interfere with the basic wage or the hours of labour, the New South Wales Government has meddled with both. Honorable senators opposite may claim changed circumstances as a justification for that action, but I remind them that the unionists of the country accepted awards in accordance with the prevailing cost of living. While that cost remains stationary or is increasing no sane man, unionist or otherwise, could honestly advocate that wages should be materially reduced or hours increased. In the circumstances, it was improper for the New South Wales Government to take away from the workers something granted them by the Arbitration Court, and governed by the cost of living. The Nationalist members of this Parliament are advocating that similar action should be taken elsewhere. All that has been done in defiance of tha pledge of the Nationalist Government not to interfere with wages and conditions.

Many honorable senators know the conditions which existed in industry before the introduction of arbitration legislation. They remember the old contract days when men were paid by results. In the days of individual bargaining numbers of contractors engaged on road construction treated their employees shamefully. They would engage men at 5s. a day, but would pay them only half that amount. There are numerous instances of contractors who, having completed their work and received payment for it, left their employees without any payment whatever.

The only means of protecting the workers is by retaining the arbitration system. The great majority of the workers to-day do not desire to cause trouble in industry. The awards of the court should, however, be reasonable. That means that they should provide reasonable living conditions. Honorable senators will accept the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins as an authority on arbitration.  His  idea of arbitration was that an award of the court should provide for a wage sufficient to feed and clothe the worker and his family decently. In his book, <inline font-style="italic">The New Province of Law and Order,</inline> he stated - </para><quote><para>One cannot conceive of industrial peace unless the employee has secured to him wages sufficient for the essentials of human existence. </para></quote><para class="block">No reasonable person would object to that standard. He went on to say - </para><quote><para>The basic wage must secure to the employee enough wherewith to renew his strength and to maintain his home from day to day. </para></quote><para class="block">Surely it is in the interest of the employer that his employees should be sufficiently fed to enable them to do their work efficiently. No sane employer would allow his horse to starve. Should a human being be less favorably treated than a horse? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins proceeded - </para><quote><para>The wages cannot be allowed to depend on the profits made by the individual employer, but the profits of which the industry is capable may be taken into account. If the industry is novel, and those who undertake it have to proceed economically, there may be a good case for keeping down wages, hut not below the basic wage, which must he sacrosanct. Above the basic wage, bargaining of the skilled employee may, with caution, be allowed to operate. </para></quote><para class="block">Every honorable senator will subscribe to that view. Whether conditions be good or bad, whether there be depression or prosperity, surely a human being is entitled to sustenance from day to day. That is all the Arbitration Court has stood for. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins said that the court would not discriminate in wages between the several States, so as to interfere with the freedom of trade between the States, provided by the Constitution. All that the Government is asking for in this bill is the power to legislate as between States. Until the act was amended by the Bruce-Page Government, the court was empowered to deal only with disputes of an interstate character. Although every dispute of any magnitude affects the whole of Australia, it has been found difficult, in practice, to prove the existence of an interstate dispute. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins also said - </para><quote><para>The court will not prescribe extra wages to compensate for unnecessary risks to the life or health of the employee, or unnecessary dirt. No employer is entitled to purchase by wages the right to endanger life or to treat men as pigs. </para></quote><para class="block">There are, unfortunately, some employers who are quite unconcerned as to the conditions under which their employees live. They are concerned only with profits. Honorable senators will admit that the plight of many workers of this country is anything but happy. Like myself, they probably never open their mail without finding in it an appeal by some one for assistance. Only this morning I received a letter from a gentleman in Sydney, in which he stated that yesterday morning he saw women weeping because of the treatment they received from the Government officials who were handing out rations to them. They were not treated as human beings. That is a deplorable state of affairs. When a government is faced with problems affecting the health and happiness of the people, this Parliament should do its utmost to assist it to relieve distress.

If that is so, it would not be safe to abide by the result of an election. I intend to do all in my power to influence the electors to support the Government in this connexion, and I trust that the Government will, as a result of the referendum, be able to give effect to its promise to safeguard the interests of the people and to protect particularly those who are always on the bread-line.

                            <para>- I realize that I have a following in the vicinity of twelve short of a majority in this chamber, and as fourteen of those who spoke on the Constitution Alteration Power of Amendment Bill said that it would be in the best interests of the country if the three constitutional measures were defeated, my pessimism is justified. I sincerely trust that my forecast on this occasion will be incorrect, and that, at any rate, in that spirit of compromise for which this chamber is noted, one of the three proposals may meet with the approval of the majority of honorable senators. In introducing this measure, I desire to direct attention to the fact that the powers of the Commonwealth in respect of trade and commerce are conferred in a manner entirely different from any other grant of power. The grant is extraordinarily composite in its nature. It is a general power over interstate and foreign commerce, including navigation, and there are various specific unlimited powers in relation to such matters as banking, insurance, weights and measures, bills of exchange, copyrights, patents and trade marks, certain corporations and bankruptcy. There is also an auxiliary power in regard to customs and bounties. As the Senate has adopted the policy of expedition in dealing with these constitutional proposals, I do not purpose wearying honorable senators with a dessertation concerning the present powers of the Parliament. I refer them to a very fine digest of its existing powers contained in the report of the Constitution Commission, which was referred to in the course of the other debates. In pages 141 to 159 they will find a complete summary of the position which confronts the Commonwealth Parliament from the point of view of the powers which it possesses and the powers which this Government believes should he conferred on it. If honorable senators will read and study that summary they will be forced to the conclusion that the grant of power was badly conceived and bears all the appearance of a muddle. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Our constitutional difficulties are accentuated by a further provision which deprives the States of full control over powers which remain with them under section 92, which enacts that trade, commerce and intercourse between the States shall be absolutely free. Admittedly that would be a wise provision if the Commonwealth had sole power. In existing circumstances it is mischievous. </para>
                    <para>This Government is accused of attempting to violate the Constitution, because it is endeavouring to provide the remedy. It is charged with attempting to take from the people certain rights which they already possess. Again I remind honorable senators that the Government has no desire to take anything away from the people. Unfortunately in regard to trade and commerce, the people have no power to legislate. Their right or so-called right is simply the right to delegate to this Parliament the power to legislate. Until they exercise that power of delegation, the so-called right remains dormant, so that actually all that they have is the right to prohibit this Parliament from legislating. If it does not legislate, the mischievous state of affairs to which I have alluded continues, and the people are powerless. If, during the regime of the Bruce-Page Administration, the Labour party had been able to give effect to one plank in its platform - the initiative, referendum and recall - one could have understood the contention that these grants of power, which the Government is seeking would, if approved by the people, be equivalent to taking from them some rights which they at present possessed. But this bill exposes the fallacy of that contention. As I have explained, the Commonwealth is endowed with certain powers and the States with the residue, and because the State power is inoperative, the people are impotent. They could return a State Government to power, but it would be powerless to legislate in regard to trade and commerce. This Parliament also is unable to do anything. It will be seen, therefore that the Government does not propose to take from the people the right to regulate trade and commerce. All that it asks is that they shall extend to the </para>
                    <para class="block">Parliament the right to legislate, in regard to trade and commerce, along the only lines possible. </para>
                    <para>I remind honorable senators that those who charge this Government with attempting to violate the Constitution represent a political party which presumably has always been the champion of State rights, and would at all times urge the people to rebel against any attempt to violate the Constitution. I ask them to bear in mind the cases which I mentioned when moving the second reading of the proposal to ask the people to give this Parliament power to amend the Constitution, and to remember that no protest was made against the Wheat Acquisition Act or against any other actions which led up to the litigation to which I alluded. There was no objection in regard to those matters, because every one realized that it was desirable to obtain from the people the right to legislate to remedy the chaotic state of affairs which obtained. Has the voice of any honorable senator been raised against the violation of the spirit of section 92 by States which have exercised the power of eminent domain in order <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prevent the operation of that section? I do not imply that such action has been taken in any wanton spirit, but I wish to show that the division of powers is fundamentally wrong. </para>
                    <para>In the very statement that trade and commerce among the States shall be free, it is implicit that commercial horizons extend beyond State boundaries, and that commerce is not of a domestic nature controllable in a domestic manner. The general power given to the Commonwealth has been used in late years in connexion with the organization of certain rural industries. As with the State in organizing a local industry, so with the Commonwealth in organizing a national industry - a lack of necessary power is immediately evident. In these national marketing schemes resort  has  to be had to a clumsy expedient. Bodies representative of the particular industry submit their scheme to the Commonwealth Parliament and their respective State Parliaments to take the necessary legislative steps. It might be necessary for four separate Parliaments to pass acts to put a single scheme into operation. Briefly we employ four machines to do the work of one. The customs' power is not merely a means of raising revenue. </para>
                    <para class="block">We are using that power and the bounty power to establish manufactures in Australia in order that our wealth may increase and unemployment decrease. Having established an industry in Australia by means of our tariff, and perhaps fostered it by a bounty, are we to be left without further powers in regard to it? Do we not hear to-day complaints as to profiteering under the shelter of the tariff wall recently created? To destroy the wall is a counsel of desperation. It is merely to retreat to the evils we have striven to shut out. It is inequitable, for both the scrupulous and the unscrupulous are penalized. We are compelled to rely on public opinion to do what we should have power to do. I invite those honorable senators who allege that the Government has raised the tariff wall and done nothing to protect the consumer, to pay due regard to the limited powers at the disposal of the Government. If they appreciate its difficulties, they should be prepared to support it in asking for this grant of power to pass the necessary legislation to protect trade and commerce in all its ramifications. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has threatened to make public the names of traders who exploit the people, hoping that the people will defend themselves. Was ever a National Parliament so naked and defenceless as to be compelled to say to the people: "We cannot help you ; look to yourself for protection." We desire that this Parliament shall have the right to give ample protection to trade and commerce and not to be hampered, as at present, by constitutional limitations. In view of the fact that dual jurisdiction does not arise - </para>

                            <para>- I do not object to criticism. On the contrary, I invite it. The point I was leading up to was this: While it is possible, even under this power, to have dual jurisdiction, the National Parliament, vested with full power over trade and commerce, would analyse the position in the light of public opinion, and in giving effect to its policy with regard to trade and commerce, it would leave to the States the powers necessary for the efficient working of the State machinery. This proposal will not create conflicting jurisdictions as between the Commonwealth and the States. It is designed to give to the Commonwealth Parliament the right to legislate in relation to trade and commerce on lines which will enable such power to play its part in the national life of this community. Whatever the Senate may think of the other two proposals it should, in view of the opinions expressed by honorable senators from time to time, be unanimous that the Commonwealth should be given the legislative powers asked for in this instance. </para>

                        PEARCE (Western Australia) [9.1]. - I do not ask for the adjournment of the debate because I appreciate the desire of the Government to push on with business, and I do not know that we need further time to consider this measure. I want, however, to take exception to some statements appearing in the press about the progress that has been made in the Senate on these constitution alteration proposals. I notice that the Prime Minister is reported to have said that these measures were introduced in the Senate many weeks ago, the suggestion being that there has been undue delay in dealing with them here. The facts are that the messages from the House of Representatives transmitting the bills were received on the 10th April, just six weeks ago, and the Leader of the Government in this chamber
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline>
                        did not move the second reading of two of them until the 30th April, just four weeks ago. Surely it cannot be said that this is an undue length of time. Neither can it be said that the Senate has shown a disposition to block the passage of the bills or delay them.

I can understand, however, that it seems a long time to the Prime Minister.  His  position reminds me of the man who remarked to his wife that they had been married for a long time, and when she replied," Why it is only a few years ", said, " Well, it seems a long time ". I can understand that four weeks of the life the Prime Minister has been living recently may seem a long time. </para>

                    <para>This bill is of great importance. Its effect, if carried, would be as far-reaching as that of the bill to take full legislative power to alter the Constitution. If we were to pass it and the people agreed to it, this Parliament would be clothed with power, not to alter the Constitution as it pleased, but to effect something which would have the same result. Unification would be an accomplished fact. The. report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution contains the following :  - </para>

                        <para>The terms " trade and commerce " have a very wide connotation, and if the power to legislate with respect to trade and commerce were transferred to the Commonwealth Parliament, we think that it would be difficult to say what powers were left to a State, or what acts of a State Parliament might not be overridden by federal laws. We do not think that the same reasons against limiting the federal power to trade and commerce with other countries and among the States exist in Australia, as might be urged with regard to the Constitution of the United States of America. In Australia, where the States are relatively few and large, where the population is concentrated in a few cities and each capital is on or adjacent to the coast, it is much easier for the States to control commercial activities and to deal with any abuses that may arise, than it would be if the States were small and approximately equal in size. In our opinion a wise course was followed in the 1891 draft and in the Constitution itself when, instead of a complete power to legislate with respect to trade and commerce being conferred, certain elements of that power were mentioned separately and such powers were conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament as it was thought could conveniently be exercised by a central legislature. </para>

                    <para class="block">The point is put so well there that I do not propose to elaborate it. The term, " trade and commerce " is exceedingly wide. It covers a multitude of subjects - not merely the carriage of goods and passengers, but also the buying, exchange and selling of goods, and legislation governing those activities. It covers fully 75 per cent. of the activities of the States. If this bill were approved by Parliament and accepted by the people, the Commonwealth could strip the States of all their powers in regard to trade and commerce. It would have unlimited power over an enormous field. </para>

                        has mentioned one case in which he claims this power is needed. He says that the Commonwealth has no power to protect consumers from the profiteering that has already taken place under the high tariff and tariff embargoes imposed by the present Government, although the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs have been trying to make the people believe that the Government has the necessary power, but cannot exercise it. The only effective way of preventing the profiteer from taking advantage of a high tariff is to deprive him of the duties under the shelter of which he is profiteering; but, of course, objection may be raised to that because its effect is to punish the innocent as well as the guilty. The power the Prime Minister wants is that which every State Parliament has to-day : the power to fix prices.

                            <para>- I was just about to tell the Senate of the experience we had of price-fixing during the war. Under the War Precautions Act the Commonwealth Parliament had unlimited power - as much power as it would have if this alteration of the Constitution were made. When it was alleged that there was profiteering in the sale of meat, the Government set out to fix the retail price of meat. Our experience reminded us of one of Gilbert and Sullivan's operas. When we fixed the retail price we found that it did not " do the job." We, therefore, went beyond the retailer to the wholesale man, but when we got to him we found that it did not " do the job " - that there was some one else behind him. And so we went on chasing these various people until we had a whole network of war precautions regulations, only to find that as fast as we extended the net in one direction, the fish were slipping through in some other direction. Finally, in despair, we abandoned the whole thing. The price-fixing of meat broke down under its own weight. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> for refreshing my memory of that striking example of the futility of Parliament endeavouring in this way to interfere with the natural laws of supply and demand, which have a nasty knack of slipping through any legal nets that may be spread. The experience the present Government has already encountered in its endeavour to interfere with some of these natural laws will make it very much wiser before twelve months are over. Many of the States have endeavoured to fix prices ; but can any honorable senator point to any State attempt in that respect that has been successful? Fair rents courts have been set up to fix rents, with the unfortunate result that in the cities where the rents are fixed by law the tenants pay higher rents than are paid in the cities where fair rents courts have not been set up. </para>

                    <para>The proposal before us is a most peculiar one.

                    <para class="block">In Victoria, there are railways and tramways the property of the State, and tramways the property of private companies. By this proviso the Commonwealth Parliament would have power in respect of any private railways in Victoria or tramways, the property of the State or the property of a private company, but no power in respect to railways, the property of the State. It would have power to regulate motor traffic. Can we imagine this Parliament taking power to solve the problem of the 'buses? This Parliament - which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> is so fond of reminding us is a National Parliament - is to amend the Constitution so that we can tell the people of the States how to run their motor 'buses. Many State Premiers have become prematurely grey over the problem of motor 'buses; but we are to show them how to solve it ! </para>
                    <para>The previous bill sought power for the Federal Government to fix wages, salaries, hours and conditions of labour. This Government has no compunction in regard to that. It will cheerfully determine salaries, wages, and the hours to be worked on the State railways; but the fixing of fares and freights, from which the States derive the revenue with which to pay those wages and salaries, is magnanimously left to the States. An embarrassing power, indeed, in the circumstances ! Frequently, in times of depression, the States find it necessary to increase fares and freights, so that, under" this provision, the privilege of doing the unpleasant things will be left to the State governments, while the Federal Parliament will have a monopoly of the things that are pleasant. This Parliament is to be a sort of Father Christmas, distributing gifts in the form of higher rates of pay and shorter hours to the State railway employees, and leaving to the unfortunate States the task of finding the necessary funds. The Federal Government also seeks power to take control of intra-state navigation. There may be something to be said for that; but is the Commonwealth to control navigation on the river Murray, or the sending of barges down the river Darling and internal navigation generally? The States evidently are thought to be incompetent to control that sort of thing, so this Government must take it over ! </para>

When companies are registered under six separate company laws the procedure must make for a lot more employment, but employment that is useless and uneconomical. A uniform company law would be of some service to the Commonwealth. Then there is the control of aviation. To-day the Federal Parliament can control interstate aviation ; but the power of regulation generally in regard to aviation remains with the States. I believe that four out of the six States agreed to vest full control with this Parliament. Several practical schemes such as these might have been properly considered by the Government. Instead we are asked to approve of a comprehensive power such as this, which will emasculate the States and destroy their powers. If granted this power the Federal Parliament could practically strip the States of their -authority. </para>

I conclude by pointing out that this proposal, like the Power of Amendment Bill, is merely another step towards giving effect to the platform of honorable senators opposite, in compliance with a " mandate " of which we hear so much. It is a step towards that socialization of industry of which we have read so much in the reports of the Labour Congress now sitting in Canberra. We are informed that the nationalization of industry is not sufficient. The railways are nationalized, but that is not enough. There must be socialization. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> to be good enough to illustrate the difference between nationalization and socialization of industry so that we shall know exactly what the Government is aiming at. </para>

                            <para>- It could be given effect to if this bill were carried. The Federal Government would then have full power over trade and commerce, and could " socialize " the shipping industry and many other industries. According to the Labour conference now sitting in Canberra the only way to cure unemployment is to socialize industry. Nationalization will not effect that cure ; socialization will. What is the difference? I understand that nationalization of industry means ownership by the State, while socialization of industry means not ownership by the State or by the people, but ownership by those who work in the particular industry concerned. That is the ideal for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> strives. If this bill were given effect it would be possible to socialize motor traffic, and 'bus services - transport of every description in the air, on the land, and on the water. That is why the Labour Government seeks this sweeping amendment of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- I am not advocating handing over anything ; I am dealing with the proposals of the Government. To-night I am the critic; the honorable senator is the creator. It is for him to rise presently, unless his leader says he shall not, and tell us what his Government proposes to do under these powers. Whilst the Vice-President of the Executive Council gave us a very learned disquisition upon the legal effect of the measure he did not give us any indication of how the Government was going to give effect to its platform, or carry out the "mandate" that it received at the last general election. With his characteristic caution the honorable senator has not seen fit to lift the curtain to let us see what lies beyond. So I am hoping that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> will tell us what is to be the next step. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> has assured us that the people are "waiting with their mouths open " to get a chance to carry these bills by tremendous majorities when the referendums are taken. It would be extremely interesting to be told what the Government will then do to abolish unemployment. Is socialization of industry to be the remedy? Russia has socialization of industry. There is no private enterprise there at all, yet millions of its people are unemployed and starving. </para>

                            <para>- I have my doubts on that point. The Postmaster-General happens to be a Tasmanian, and he has had some experience of State-owned ships. I venture to say that when it comes to the nationalization of shipping the honorable gentleman will have something to say on the subject. Again, with the Treasurer facing his next budget I cannot see any immediate move towards the nationalization of the industry. In any case, it is not the nationalization, but the socialization of industry that is talked of. </para>

                        PEARCE.The difference is that with the socialization of the industry the men who manned the ships would own them. That perhaps would make things easy for the Treasurer, because he would not have to find the money. I assume that it would be found by the Seamens Union. Of course, the property may be expropriated. That is another word in the lexicon of honorable senators opposite. It is difficult to say what might be done in the way of expropriation or compensation.

If I am able to read aright public opinion in the State that I represent not one of these bills has a chance of obtaining anything like a majority there.

That was only natural, seeing that the other proposals are alternative to this one. Should the people of Australia  Hot  be prepared to give to the Federal Parliament the right to alter the Constitution, the Government asks them to give to Parliament  the power to deal with industrial arbitration and trade and commerce. While I appreciate that anything that I can say is not likely to influence the decision of the Opposition regarding this measure. I wish to emphasize that they have nothing to fear from the present Government should it be entrusted with the power it seeks. It is not the policy of the Government to dismember the States, as has been suggested. I do not think that honorable senators opposite really believe that this, or any other government, would attempt to exercise the powers sought in this bill in the way that has been suggested. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2188</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6I</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAPMAN, John</name><name role="display">Senator Chapman</name></talker><para>- Then why ask for such powers? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2188</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, John</name><name role="display">Senator DALY</name></talker><para>- 1 remember that among the ghosts and fairy stories to which I listened when a boy there was one about a big giant who ground people up and ate them.

The present Government has no desire to do that. Indeed, it has no desire to assume control of any activities which properly belong to the States. If it obtains the power it seeks, it will exercise that power along national lines. In dealing with national questions, it desires that it shall not be circumscribed by constitutional limitations. I want to make it clear that this proposal has not arisen from any conflict of opinion expressed by judges, as has been suggested. I merely quoted that conflict as an example of what any parliament might expect when certain powers are enumerated. One of the maxims of the law is that there should be an end to litigation. In framing its' laws, every Parliament should strive to end litigation. One of the reasons why the Government asks for general powers, as" opposed to specific powers, is that they might obviate the necessity for a third body being required to interpret the power of Parliament. It desires that the Federal Parliament shall be untrammelled by constitutional limitations, and that a governments hall be able to carry into effect every promise that it makes to the people on the hustings. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2189</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>- That would be  dangerous. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2189</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, John</name><name role="display">Senator DALY</name></talker><para>- On the contrary, it would tend to make parties careful what promises they made to the electors.

It has been said that although the Government professes to be desirous of abolishing dual control, its proposals mean the perpetuation of dual control. It is difficult for me to understand that argument, because the Opposition has complained that the Government's second proposal does not go far enough. When we submit a proposal under which the Commonwealth Parliament would have very extensive powers we are told that we are going too far. This Government, which is honest in its desire to terminate dual industrial control, supported the contention of the late Government that the only way in which to end dual control was to place the power in the hands of one authority, but we suggested that that should be the federal authority which should establish State tribunals to deal with purely domestic problems. Under such a scheme we should be able to secure a greater measure of industrial peace than is possible to-day. While the Government pays every regard to the opinions expressed by organizations of employers or employees and is prepared to listen to any arguments they advance, in the final analysis its actions are governed by the policy of the party which elected it to power. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>made certain references to trade union organizations and to the action of the Labour party in declining to stand behind the Government of which he was a member in its endeavour to secure control of the ballots taken by trade union organizations. The real objection of the Labour party to that proposal was because one particular section of the community, whose liberties were to be seriously curtailed, were singled out for special treatment. Surely the morale of the Australian people has not fallen to such an extent that an organization cannot be trusted to take a ballot of its members? We were strongly opposed to placing any stigma upon the members of trade union organizations, or acting in such a way as to make it appear that they were so corrupt that they could not be allowed to control their own ballots. We simply said to the Government of the day, "Keep your hands off organizations which are quite capable of looking after themselves ". Surely it is not suggested that this Government would abuse the powers which it is seeking to obtain in. the way the past Government endeavoured to abuse its power some months ago? It was also suggested that we should allow matters to remain as they are, and that we might even dispense with arbitration and get back to the old system of bargaining. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2190</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3X</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CARROLL, William</name><name role="display">Senator Carroll</name></talker><para>-  The honorable senator would he pleased if Parliament could be relieved of the responsibility of arbitration. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2190</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, John</name><name role="display">Senator DALY</name></talker><para>- Nothing was further from my mind than to suggest that Parliament should be relieved of that responsibility. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2190</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0F</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PEARCE, George</name><name role="display">Senator Sir George Pearce</name></talker><para>-  Arbitration will be the means of getting rid of the Minister and his followers in the long run. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2190</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JTL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, John</name><name role="display">Senator DALY</name></talker><para>- If a majority in this chamber forces us to leave arbitration where it is to-day we may be submerged in the flood of public opinion that will rise against us.

                        outlined objections to federation, such as the extravagance of the Federal Government, the unfair incidence of the tariff on primary producing States, and duplication of services and officials. He declared that secession could be accomplished legally and constitutionally, and explained how, in his opinion, this could be done.
