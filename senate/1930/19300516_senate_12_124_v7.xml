        <para class="block">I have had my attention directed to the. inconvenience and serious consequences suffered by certain policy-holders owing to the practice of some companies in fixing the period at 30 days. The Australian Mutual Provident Society, and a number of other companies, allow one month, but the Mutual Life adheres to the period of 30 days, and the result is confusion. The number of days in the different months varies. February may have 28 or 29 days; some months have 30 days and others 31 days. I am advised that it is desirable to secure uniformity, and that the practice adopted by the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and certain other companies, is preferable to any other arrangement. . </para>

          <para>. - It is more advantageous to policy-holders to have the period fixed at 30 days instead of one month. I may also remind the honorable senators that the period mentioned in this clause is super-imposed upon the period of grace allowed by companies for the payment of premiums. I have no objection to the amendment, but I would point out that in the case of one month policy-holders would have less grace than is provided for in the clause. I hope the honorable senator will not press this amendment, but if its acceptance will facilitate the passage of the bill, I shall offer no objection. </para>

          <para>.- I am advised that it would be more convenient for policy-holders to have the period fixed at one month instead of 30 days. If a policy matures on the 15th of one month the holder will know that he will be allowed until the 15th of the following month for the payment of the premiums. He will not have to calculate when the period of 30 days will expire. There have been serious consequences in certain cases from the operation of this provision governing the period of. grace. My amendment is a small one, and I trust that honorable senators will accept it. It will be a convenience to policy-holders generally. </para>

          <para>.- The clause provides that in the event of any premiums due on any life policy remaining unpaid for a longer period than 30 days, the company may charge compound interest thereon. I should like to know what justification there is for charging compound instead of simple interest in such circumstances. If compound interest is charged it may cause the forfeiture of policies which would be detrimental not only to the individual policy-holders, but to the company. An enormous number of policies are forfeited every year in consequence of policyholders being unable to keep up their premiums. Those who have had experience know that compound, interest is an excessive burden, and in these circumstances the companies should be satisfied with simple interest on overdue premiums. Too many penalties are imposed on policy-holders who are unable to meet their obligations, which, in many instances, cause forfeitures. I move - </para>

          <para>. - If a policy-holder refrains for a considerable period from paying his premium, the company is deprived of the use of that money, and in  the circumstances is entitled to charge compound interest. If the company had the money at' its disposal, it would be receiving interest on it. The contract between the companies and the policy-holders provides for the payment of premiums within a specified period, and if the money is not placed at the disposal of the company in accordance with the terms of the contract, compound interest should be payable. If it were merely a question of 30 days, compound interest would not be charged, but over a longer period it would be a serious matter, particularly where a number of cases were involved. The point we have to consider is whether it is fair to place a defaulter in a better position than the policy-holder who has paid his premiums. If SenatorRae, for instance, paid his premium on the due date and I, as another policy-holder, refrained from doing so for perhaps two or three years, he should not be compelled to suffer indirectly as a result of my default. This provision, I understand, has been taken from the Queensland act, and was inserted for the protection of policyholders. We wish to assist the policyholders, but we should not extend leniency towards some at the expense of, others. If a. policy-holder in a mutual or cooperative company does not in these circumstances pay compound interest he has an undue advantage over those who have paid their premiums on the due. date. </para>

          <para>. - I remindSenator Rae that all interest charged is more or less on a compound basis. The use of the word " compound " in this instance is to simplify bookkeeping. A person who receives financial assistance from a bank, and who does not reduce the amount every six months, or within whatever period may be arranged, is charged interest on the balance, which, in effect, is compound interest. I do not think that the impost is as great as Senator Rae thinks. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [11.21]. - The obvious answer to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> is that instead of simple interest on overdue premiums imposing hardships upon other policy-holders, it would be of benefit to the policy-holders, particularly in a mutual society, because the number of forfeitures would necessarily be reduced, and consequently the general financial position of the society would be improved. We should make it easier for those in temporary financial difficulties, and if provision were made to charge simple instead of compound interest I think it would "be ultimately to the benefit of the companies. Life insurance policies are usually taken out for the purpose of providing funds for the widow and orphans of the person insured. It is usually financial stress that compels policy-holders to get into arrears in the matter of premiums, and every effort should be made to assist them to retain their policies. The payment of simple instead of compound interest would make if easier for those policy-holders who are in arrears, and would not, I submit, be detrimental to. the interests of other policy-holders. </para>

          <para>.-If the amendment were adopted, it would, perhaps, make it easier for policy-holders who were in arrears, but it would be at the expense of other policy-holders who had paid their premiums within the specified time. If the money were in the coffers of the company from the date on which it was due, it would be earning interest. In these circumstances, I do not think it unjust to charge compound interest; to do otherwise would be to act unjustly towards those who had met their obligations. </para>

        <para>SenatorRae.- The surrender value of a policy would be exhausted more rapidly if compound interest were charged. </para>

There is always a danger associated with an amendment that excludes certain things. I believe that it can be argued that if you exclude certain things, you include those that are not so expressly excluded. This amendment says, in effect, that if a non-fraudulent omission or statement is made affecting a policy for less than Â£100, the policy shall not be invalidated. Is it not natural to infer that if a non-fraudulent statement is made in a policy exceeding Â£100, that policy will be invalidated. My recollection is that a previous clause lays down the procedure in respect of policies in. which there has been a non-fraudulent omission or statement. </para><para>SenatorMcLachlan. - That refers to industrial policies. </para><para>

          <para>. - We know what happened in the unfortunate cases referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and SenatorRae, but are they really sufficient to warrant the inclusion of the words proposed? In ordinary circumstances, the woman who insures the life of her husband does so to protect herself and her children against an impecunious husband whom she sees is heading for ruin. It may be an inducement to her to end his days earlier than otherwise might be the case, but if she had a recalcitrant husband who did not wish to be insured, it would be difficult for her to achieve her purpose, because the amount of premium payable and the attitude of the company would be determined only after a medical examination. I think it is better to allow the clause to stand. This provision is to be found in State legislation upon which the hill is based, and I have not heard of its abuse. In any case it would be extremely difficult to insure any person's life without first obtaining his or her consent. If, for example, an honorable senator had designs on my life, and with that end in view attempted to get a cover from an insurance company, the company approached would require first to be sure that the risk was reasonable, and this could not be determined until there had been the usual medical examination. </para>

It is much easier to decide whether something which is in the bill should come out than it is to decide whether something which is not in the bill should be inserted. Acting on this principle, I suggest to tha honorable senator now that he might very well accept this amendment for the time being, so as to allow it to appear in the amended print of the bill. We may then give it further consideration, and, if we do not approve of it, strike it Â»ut. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> with his knowledge of insurance practice, doubtless considers that this amendment is necessary. T am somewhat conservative in matters of this kind, and also with respect to legal procedure. Subclause 1 of this clause provides for a separate instrument, of assignment, as set out in the seventh schedule, and the procedure laid down is similar to that provided' in connexion with a Torren's title under the Real Property Act. An ordinary transfer form is to be signed by the transferor and the transferee; but it is now proposed that the transfer shall be endorsed upon the policy and the document registered. The duplicate retained by the company would be endorsed by the Registrar, and the original document returned to the policy-holder, who, for the time being, would be the person to whom the assignment  had  been  made.  That is contrary to the principles of registration with respect to land transfers. When the instrument of transfer is signed and witnessed, it is handed to the Registrar, and remains with him as a permanent record of what has occurred. This proposal would provide an opportunity for a person who was evilly disposed to destroy any evidence of an evil act. If the companies are obliged to file  a  transfer form, as proposed, with the original policy, the instrument is available at all times. For these reasons I ask the committee to leave the clause as it is, because if these words are included it would give undue opportunities to an undesirable assignee. The proper course is to place the instrument of the transfer in the keeping of the company which has to find the money. </para>

These affairs are generally in .the hands of  a  little clique. I wish to make it clear that I am not proposing that government officials shall undertake this work, but that it shall be undertaken by, auditors who belong to recognized associations of auditors and accountants. I. also desire to embody a provision similar to that which, I understand, operates in connexion with municipal affairs in Victoria, namely, that no auditor' shall audit the same company's books two years in succession, Provision to that effect would not only ensure that the auditors would not be under the thumb of the directors, but also that, the work would be distributed.

          <para>. -  I direct attention to clauses 101 and 103. The former limits the auditors to those persons who are registered as such with the Registrar; it also imposes a qualification standard. Before an auditor could be appointed he would have to furnish evidence to the satisfaction of the Registrar that he was competent to perform the duties of an auditor. Section 103 provides that the auditors shall he elected, not by the directors or officers of the company, but by the shareholders or policy-holders. </para>

            <para>- I think it is a sufficient safeguard that the Registrar, who will be an actuary, must be satisfied with the qualifications of the auditors. Unless there was dishonesty, the work of auditing would be greatly facilitated by having the same auditor to examine a company's books each  year  He would thus become familiar with the method of bookkeeping, and be able to examine the accounts with much greater facility than would another auditor. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>- -I think not. The clause provides for delegated authority. Experience has shown that the more steps we take in that delegation, the further we get from what is most desirable. There is a tendency for all these matters to become routine. Unless something definite were known against  an auditor, he would automatically receive the endorsement of the Registrar. I agree that the more frequently an auditor audits the books of a company, the more familiar he becomes with its system of bookkeeping; but that is a minor matter compared with the necessity - a necessity amply demonstrated by recent happenings in New South Wales - for a stricter oversight of the auditing of the books of public companies than now exists. My amendment would not introduce an instalment of socialism, or  even  of unionism, excepting, perhaps, that whatever auditors were appointed would be members of organizations which admit to membership only persons with certain qualifications. If the appointment of auditors rested with the Government, there would be a distribution of the work among the men qualified to perform it. </para>

            <para>- I think not, although in all human institutions there is a percentage of fallibility. There is less danger to be feared from that source than from the hole-and-corner way in which auditors are sometimes appointed. The policy-holders of a company who may be scattered over a continent cannot be organized to take definite action in  any  direction, so that any provision purporting to give them the right to appoint auditors, is, in reality, of little or no effect. We all know that in practice the control of these companies is in the hands of a small body of men, generally those who live near the head-quarters of the company. Moreover, company meetings are usually held in the daytime, when many of the policy-holders cannot attend. And even if they do attend, should they raise any objection to the proposals of the directors, or seek information, they are frequently frowned upon, or even counted out. The danger is accentuated by the provision that any vacancies on the directorate which occur during the year may be filled by the remaining directors. It cannot be denied that the control of many of these- companies is in the hands of a small coterie. I recollect that a certain judge in New South Wales, when informed during the hearing of a case that certain books had been audited, spoke with some scorn as to the reliance that is to be placed on the accuracy of accounts merely because they have been audited. </para>

            <para>- If my proposal were adopted the auditors would be changed round each year. The man who audited the books of the National Mutual Company this year might audit those of the Australian Mutual Provident Company next year. The activities of the companies are very much alike, and competent men would soon acquire a knowledge that would enable them to move from company to company without difficulty. Such a method would secure the confidence of the public, as an auditor would take care to see that his work was above criticism, in order to avoid adverse comment from the man who followed him. The amendment seeks to prevent the practice of accepting everything that is done by an auditor without demur. I seek only to protect the interests of the public. My proposal would prevent any family arrangement on the part of the directors of a company to appoint an auditor of their own choosing. As things stand the Registrar, in 99 cases out. of 100, would probably offer no objection to the person chosen by the company. That is what I want to avoid. </para>

            <para>- This sort of business is unfair. We have some companies traducing others, and boosting their own concerns at the expense of others. Some form of punishment, should be meted out to them just as an individual may be punished for obtaining goods by false pretences. Under the intense competition of insurance companies, this is frequently done to the disadvantage of not only the public, but also the companies traduced. </para>

If the conduct referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> can he proved, the State law is available to the companies concerned, and they are the most vitally interested, although I recognize what a detriment it is to policy-holders, who are induced by reason of false representations to lose money by throwing up the policies they hold, and make money for the agents by taking out policies in other companies. </para>

It was one of the provisions I hoped this hill would make. Every day of the week .hundreds of policies are surf ended, because of the activities of these go-getters, and I did hope that something could" be done to1 bring punishment to bear upon them. A company should be given every facility to take proceedings against a man who has induced a policy-holder by false representation to throw up his policy, and I hope that before the bill finally leaves the Senate, something will be done to make that possible. I have had experience of men of the type I have described, but if some provision 'is made in. the bill on the lines I have suggested, it should be a warning to  the guilty, and an assistance to insurance . companies anxious to take proceedings to protect themselves. </para><continue><talk.start>

          <para>. - It is possible that the phrase referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> may need to be clarified somewhat. This legislation is confined to life insurance companies. We do not allow persons or firms to function as life insurance associations. The draftsman considered this provision necessary to meet a position that might arise if at some future time firms or persons engaged in the business of life insurance companies. The position appears to be  a  little obscure. I will give it further consideration, and, if necessary, recommit the clause. </para>
