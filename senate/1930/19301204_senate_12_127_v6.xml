          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I desire to inform the Senate that, following representations by the Government extending over some weeks, requesting that a first advance be made by the Commonwealth Bank to wheat-farmers at the rate of 2s. a- bushel at country stations, which would be equal to approximately 2s. 6d. f.o.b., the Commonwealth Bank has now decided to make an advance to pools and organizations at the rate of 2s. a bushel f.o.b. on wheat of the present season's crop, which is equal approximately to ls. 6d. a bushel at country railway stations. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I also wish to summarize very briefly the history of the negotiations leading up to that decision. Two days before the conference of representatives of the wheat industry, held in Canberra on the 12th of November last, the Acting Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> interviewed the  chairman  of directors and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and urged that an advance of 2s. a bushel at railway sidings be arranged. The reply received was that a first payment of this amount could not be made, even if guarantees were forthcoming from the Commonwealth and State Governments. This intimation was conveyed to the members of the conference. On the 22nd November, the Acting Minister for Markets interviewed the  chairman  of the board of the Commonwealth Bank <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Gibson)</inline> iu Melbourne, and urged that favorable consideration be given to the suggestion to pay  a  first advance of 2s. a bushel at country sidings. At the conference between members of the Government and the Commonwealth Bank board in Melbourne, last Monday, the 1st December, very strong representations were made by the Cabinet in favour of  a  first advance at the rate of 2s. at country sidings, or 2s. 6d. f.o.b., as it was considered by the Government that that advance could bc made without any risk of loss to the bank. The Commonwealth Bank has since considered the representations of the Government, and the following telegram has now been received from the  chairman  of the board : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The bank board yesterday evening decided to fix the advance to wheat pools at 2s. per bushel f.o.b., subject to usual conditions as between wheat pools and bank. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>While the rate of advance which the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to make is less than that desired by the Government, and is viewed with disappointment by many wheat distributing organizations, it represents a definite amount, and it is hoped that at a very early date the position of the world's market in regard to wheat will so improve as to bring about an increase in this advance. The Government will continue to do everything possible, having regard to the present financial stringency, to assist the wheatgrowers in the marketing of their present season's crop. </para>

            <para>. - Some weeks have elapsed since this unwanted foundling first made its appearance in this chamber. I remember the day well. No one - not even any supporter of the Government - was enthusiastic about it. The paper before us purports to be a statement of the Government's financial policy as amended from time to time. Whether it will be the last statement of policy which the Government will present to us, I do not know. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I was grieved yesterday to hear some honorable senators, under cover of speaking to this motion, 'make strong attacks upon a gentleman who came here at the invitation of the Government to advise it in regard to the financial position confronting the country. He came here and gave of his best. Nevertheless, during his stay with us, and for some time after his departure, some supporters of the Government, and indeed, some members of the Ministry, denied that he had been invited here by the Government. It was only after certain events had taken place in Australia that the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> issued a statement in which he admitted that this gentleman came here to assist the Government on its invitation. One honorable senator yesterday attacked what he described as " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer's proposals." I remind him that those proposals having been adopted by the Government are no longer <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer's proposals. They now form the policy of the Government, and when honorable senators attack <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer's recommendations, they are, in fact, attacking the Government they profess to support. </para>
          <para>The statement before us contains a number of extracts from the budget speech delivered in July last. It also refers to a resolution unanimously adopted by the Loan Council in August when the Prime Minister represented the Commonwealth Government. That resolution reads - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That as the loan policy of the Commonwealth and States is wrapped up with the balancing of the budgets, representatives of the Commonwealth and State Governments should meet in Melbourne on Monday, 18th August, with the object of balancing the budgets. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>At the conference between the Prime Minister and the Premiers of all the States on the 21st of August last the following resolution was unanimously adopted : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the several Governments represented at this conference declare their fixed determination to balance their respective budgets for the financial year 1930-31, and to maintain a similar balanced budget in future years. This budget equilibrium will be maintained, on such a basis as is consistent with the repayment or conversion in Australia, of the existing internal debt maturing in the next few years. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer advised the Government to do. Whether  we agree with his advice or not, we must admit that at one time the- Government accepted it. I am, therefore, surprised that Government supporters in this chamber have joined with a number of Government supporters in another place to condemn these proposals! </para>
          <para>Honorable senators supporting the Government frequently refer to " the class to which we belong; the section of the community which we represent ". In my opinion, there is no distinct wage-earning class in Australia. There is nothing to prevent any man who to-day is working for wages from working for himself tomorrow, or from employing others th, day after. Probably there are. very few senators who have not at some time or other been wage-earners. I worked for many years for wages on mines and elsewhere. It is wrong to attempt to foster class consciousness by referring so frequently to the wage-earning class. Rather should we foster the idea that every person has "equal rights to be a 'wage-earner or an employer of labour. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Throughout this document, there are references to the legacy of debt inherited by the Government from its predecessors in office as a result of their unwise administration and extravagant spending of public money. Seeing that every government in Australia, whether Nationalist or Labour, is in a bad position financially, it is useless to blame governments for our present unsatisfactory position. Without in any way attempting to excuse any government, past or present, I suggest that no government could have survived long had it acted differently from the way it did act in the days of reconstruction after the war. Every government was forced by the people into an orgy of extravagance. Indeed, the only complaint against some of them was that they did not go far enough. The public urged that more and still more money should be spent. Had any government attempted to curtail repatriation expenditure! - which has perhaps been the greatest drain on public finances - it would have been turned out of office at the first opportunity presented to the electors. Each age has its own besetting sin, and if there is one that belongs peculiarly to this age more than another, it is that of blaming the other fellow for any trouble that may be affecting the world. We are always spotless; the other fellow is invariably the one who has got us into the mess. It is consistently claimed that governments, no matter what brand of politics they may espouse, are the cause of the trouble of the moment; never is it attributed to the people who elect and maintain those governments. Time after time, in Parliament and elsewhere, individuals publicly denounce' governments for their alleged extravagant administration, knowing that their statements will be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and the press, and absorbed by the people. Publicly stigmatizing the Government, privately they run to its Ministers, pat them on the back, and solicit their favours. We should be honest and accept our share of the blame for; the trouble. In times when the country was in a good position, and money easily obtainable, we spent it profligately. Now, when our creditors ask, " What about that little debt of ours ?", we respond, " These governments have put us in a position of penury. Had it not' been for them we should be able to pay you." Let us face the music, stand up to the position like men, and meet our obligations. From my little experience of life I have learned that there is no crooked or twisted way of gaining prosperity, by the evasion of public responsibility and indebtedness. The only was is the honest way. No matter how it hurts, we should play the man and meet our obligations. If it is necessary to obtain an extension of time, why, let us frankly explain the position to our creditors. I am confident that if that is done the pressure will be relieved. </para>
          <para>The position of a nation differs in no way from that of an individual. If an individual finds himself with a diminished income, he does one of two things, or, perhaps, a little of both. He endeavours to increase his income; if he cannot do that, he reduces his expenditure. He is wise enough to realize that he cannot continue to indulge in whisky and cigars, at the same time denying himself an adequate ration of bread and meat. But luxuries must be reduced to a minimum. </para>
          <para>I have no wish to he unfair, but I believe that this Government has not made that effort to reduce its expenditure that is demanded by the needs of the moment. </para>

              <para>- Never mind about wages. Wages account for but a minor portion of our national expenditure. I wish to goodness the honorable senator could lift his mind to a higher plane, and realize that that is but one of many angles to a very difficult problem. Every man has a right to obtain the best remuneration that he can in return for the labour that he sells, but when he is faced with the plain fact that the wages he demands are not available, what is he going to do to re-adjust matters ? I should be very pleased to learn of any untouched fountain pf wealth, some  Fortunatus's  purse, waiting to be tapped, but, candidly, I do not believe such a thing exists. </para>

          <para>When one realizes that the sources of income of the people of Australia have been depleted by 50 per cent, at one fell swoop, one must conclude that it is ridiculous to blame anybody for the pinch that we are feeling. The Minister in charge of the Senate made a statement with regard- to the wheat industry. Wheat has been one of Australia's great staple crops, an asset upon which the nation has- always relied to a great extent. Year after year Commonwealth Governments have imposed burdens upon that industry and their cumulative effect has overtaxed the capacity of the industry. This is particularly so in such times as the present. Only a day or two ago a duty of £2 10s. a ton was imposed on fencing wire. Is it any wonder that in these circumstances the farmers see no ray of hope? The Minister expressed the devout hope that the price of our products will increase overseas. We echo that hope in all sincerity. While that is a factor which is beyond our power to control, we can control the cost of production, and ease the burdens that have been piled upon our important basic industries. The producers of wool, another of our great primary industries, never have, in the past, sought support from a government. Their industry has suffered the burdens placed upon it by natural and artificial conditions and has won through. But now that important industry is also in a precarious position. At last it turns to the Commonwealth Government, urging that something should be done to assist it; that a bonus should be paid on every pound of wool produced. I have just received a telegram from the south-west of Western Australia, soliciting my co-operation in that request. E believe that I speak for that industry when I say that those engaged in it would far rather be relieved of the heavy burdens that have been piled on it than ask for transitory assistance in the form of a bonus. I urge the Government to lighten the load that it and its predecessors have placed upon the primary industries; but I realize that I am practically asking for the impossible. </para>

              <para>- I was in Perth when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and the Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Moloney)</inline> passed through, <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to London. The Prime Minister was too ill to attend a civic reception that was tendered to him at  His  Majesty's Theatre, Perth, and he was represented by the Minister for Markets and Transport. I was honored with a seat on the platform, and was close enough to the honorable gentleman to hear quite distinctly everything that he said, so that I am not under any misapprehension as to his statement. He said that, in order to give effect to its policy, this Government had deliberately thrown away £12,000,000 in customs revenue. Then the Minister went on to explain that having done that the Government was forced to exploit fresh avenues of revenue to recoup itself for the losses sustained. He offered no criticism of the financial policy of the previous Government. The Minister spoke of the sales tax as one new source of revenue, and congratulated the people of Australia upon the fact that never previously had a new tax met with such universal approval. This statement, I remind honorable senators, was made at a time when the newspaper press was flooded with protests from all classes in the community against the imposition of this tax, and complaining of its anomalies. No one seemed to know from day to day what it meant or how it was going to be applied, and daily fresh rulings were being broadcast by the Commissioner of Taxation. If that was the reception given by the people to a form of taxation which, according to the Minister for Markets, had received universal approval, I wonder what would have been the attitude of the people under the imposition of a new tax which had not their approval. Since the occasion to which I refer, the sales tax has been increased, and additional customs and excise duties have been imposed. I say quite openly that it is a fallacy for the people of Australia to think that the Federal Parliament, through its legislation, rules this country. It is now twelve months since the Scullin Government came into office. During that time it has brought down numerous tariff schedules and we have not been given an opportunity to deal with any one of them. </para>

              <para>- I venture the opinion that, before Parliament is given an opportunity to consider the Government's tariff policy, the number of schedules will have been substantially increased. The Constitution provides that the power of the Parliament to impose taxation through customs and excise shall be exclusive. Since the Scullin Government came into office it has collected customs and excise duties under varying tariff schedules which this Parliament has not had an opportunity to consider. No one can say when we shall be invited to approve or disapprove of the Government's tariff policy, but since we have waited for so long I suppose a little further delay will not make a great deal of difference. </para>

          <para>I wish to impress upon the Ministry and honorable senators the urgent necessity for governmental expenses to be reduced to the lowest level compatible with the rendering of efficient service to the community. In view of the fact that the incomes of the great industries upon which we depend for our national safety have been reduced by more than 50 per cent., it is the obvious duty of this Government to take the necessary action to meet the altered conditions. The Ministry should come right out into the open and declare its determination to do the right thing. I well remember the first meeting of this Parliament in Canberra in May, 1927. "We were told then that this was the first Parliament in the Commonwealth, and that the eyes of the English-speaking world were upon us. Naturally, we felt rather proud of our position among the nations of the world at that time. It is, therefore, somewhat humiliating now to realize that, after all, the Federal Parliament is not the paramount governing authority in the Commonwealth; that the measures to be presented to it, and its deliberations on matters of moment, were held in abeyance pending the verdict of the people of New South "Wales in a recent State election. The Government should have been courageous enough to stand by its determination to give effect to the agreement entered into' by the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> with the Premiers of the various States, before he left Australia, to take all measures necessary to balance the budget. That pledge has not been honored. The people of Australia may overlook some of the misdeeds of this Parliament, but they will not forget or forgive the action of this </para>

            <para>.- So much has been said during the course of this debate that there is little one can usefully add; but I desire to make a few general observations on the position as I see it. This is, I understand, a special emergency session. It was called pursuant to the Melbourne conference resolutions which embodied the terms of an agreement on the financial situation made between the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the various States. That agreement followed a series of conferences with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, representing the Bank of England, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, at which every aspect of the financial position of the Commonwealth was fully considered. It bears the signature of the right honorable the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and the signatures of all the Premiers of the States representing every brand of politics ; and we have been called together pursuant to that agreement, in order to pass financial measures which will assist in restoring budget equilibrium. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We all know the dire need of our country. Industries are languishing. There is a lack of money, and public finance is in a state of hopeless disorder. The key to the whole situation is public finance. We shall not restore financial stability or bring about that feeling of confidence which is so essential until public finance is adjusted and we have continuity of policy in regard to financial matters. The people whom we represent are looking for leadership. They are bewildered and harassed; they are in doubt and perplexity. I do not desire to sound a pessimistic note or to pose as a Jeremiah, but I see disquieting symptoms. I have abundant faith, however, in the recuperative qualities of Australia, in its citizenship and in the character of its people. I believe that, given a lead along a courageous path, the people are prepared to follow it, but I look in vain for that courageous lead. I presume that honorable senators a'gree that we are in a period of great financial stress, if not approaching a crisis, and what we want in a period of crisis is a definite and not a vacillating policy. The people have a right to expect what those of us who have been nurtured in British traditions of Parliamentary Government look for, and that is unity of command, Cabinet solidarity, which is a basic principle of representative government. They have a right to expect the Government to speak with one voice and to give a definite lead. Until we have that we cannot restore confidence or financial stability. </para>
          <para>But we have confronting us the amazing spectacle of honorable senators closely associated with the Government repudiating by implication, if not directly, an agreement to which the Government is a party and attacking the person who was primarily responsible for the promulgation of that agreement. With a leadership of that kind, what can we expect from the community, but doubt, perplexity, confusion? A principle in which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have been nurtured is that of Cabinet solidarity - the Government speaking as one man and acting unitedly. In a time of military difficulty, as the soldiers in our chamber will explain, there must be unity of command; there must be purpose and determination and concentration of effort.. You must know exactly what your objective is and must devise the be3t means of arriving at it. But here we have a captain, the right honorable the Prime Minister, who has temporarily surrendered his command while away on Government business on the other side of the globe, and members of his Cabinet who appear to owe no particular loyalty to any leader. They do not appear to be able to follow consistently the declarations of the leader of the Government or the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> but seem to be at liberty to act according to their own sweet will, and to speak at random in an utterly irresponsible fashion. Unless, in place of all this . confusion, we can restore confidence by having a definite policy and a clear line of action, and particularly a clear indication from the Government that it is prepared to lead the people along a definite line, we shall never find financial salvation; we shall never put the public finances on a proper basis, or restore them to a state of system and order. </para>
          <para>What boots it to discuss at this stage who is responsible for the present position? There are economic factors beyond the control of any Government that are partly responsible for it. But what does it matter? Here we are an allegedly united people in a state of great financial difficulty. Some are more pressed than others, but obviously the position is calling for drastic remedies, earnestness, resourcefulness, fixity of purpose and definite leadership. I cannot find that definiteness of leadership in the responsible Government of this country to-day. I do not know what the Government wants us to do. I do not know where it proposes to lead the people. Is it really going to honour the Melbourne agreement, and seek to restore budget equilibrium? Is it making an honest and concerted effort to that end or is it endeavouring not to do those things which will offend its political supporters? Is it influenced by a consideration for the wellbeing, honour and credit of Australia or by political considerations in the policy or lack of policy which it has announced ? I do not know whom I am to follow. I understand that the Nationalist party is only too willing to give support to any party that is prepared to take its courage in both hands and lead the people out of this financial morass. Our party is prepared to make the necessary sacrifices in order that the interests of Australia may be placed above party considerations. That should be the attitude of all of us. </para>

          <para>We have met for a financial session. I have taken part in emergency sessions of Parliament, and have found them characterized by a spirit of determination, concentration, earnestness1 and zeal. 33ut during this so-called emergency session, we have drifted on and on in a vague, vacillating and indefinite way. How long have we been, sitting? What has been done ? One would think that there was no crisis, no emergency, no need to meet the financial situation. The actions of the Government have been characterized by hesitancy, delay, and vacillation. Long before Parliament was summoned, it was obvious that the finances were drifting, and that the position called for immediate remedy and drastic action. Yet time was allowed to slip by. Instead of taking their courage in both hands and saying, " Parliament must meet, irrespective of whatever elections are taking place in any of the States, so that it may have the earliest opportunity to deal with ' appropriate remedies to meet the present situation'", Ministers hesitated. "He who hesitates is lost ". And that is what has happened. Instead of being strong and courageous, Ministers delayed. They listened to the voice of the tempter and finally, when they called Parliament together, presented a financial statement which is obviously a compromise between the conflicting factions in Cabinet and the party. The public still remains without definite leadership in this hour of crisis. </para>
          <para>We cannot get financial order in this country until public finance is straightened out. As I have already said, public finance is the key to the whole situation. All along the line there will be embarrassment and difficulty and, in some instances, bankruptcy - all those privations that our people are called upon to suffer - as well as the dread spectre of unemployment which haunts us all. And these are what it is our duty to cure. We ought to be able to deal with them above party considerations or party manoeuvring. We ought to be able to concentrate in a united effort towards finding adequate solutions for the present difficulties. I have no right to speak for the Nationalist party, to which I belong, but I feel confident that if the Government would approach the position in that spirit, honorable senators of my party would meet the Government more than half way in an endeavour to apply appropriate remedies to the present situation. Surely any remedies proposed should involve certain principles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> referred to domestic economy, and pointed out what a private individual would have to do in the event of his income suddenly diminishing while his expenditure remained at the same level. Such a person would have to drastically economize. There is no difference in principle between the individual and the nation. It is absurd to be imposing burdensome and confiscatory taxation upon the people at a time like this. These heavy burdens are being imposed at a time when the incomes of the people have been diminished, and when they are less able to bear added responsibilities. It may be necessary to increase taxation. I believe in every effort being made to balance our budget; but before there is any increase in taxation, such as is proposed, there should be evidence of substantial economy. It is absurd to say that greater economy than that proposed by the Government cannot be effected. The Government is proceeding as it would in normal times, as if everything were all right. Just as private individuals have to economize in times of depression, so governments should do likewise, without, of course, sacrificing efficiency. </para>

              <para>- I am not discussing the previous Government at present. T point out that there is an  urgent cry for economy in public expenditure. Certain services have to be maintained in a state of efficiency, but the principle which the people expect us to support is one under which economy precedes increased taxation. Petty economies are of no value ; we need something of a substantial nature which will aid the country at a time of crisis. If it is a question of imposing additional taxation, surely the principle which should find expression in our legislation should be that of equality of sacrifice. There should not be any sheltered persons in the community. No one wishes to bring men 'below the bread and butter margin, or to deprive them of the basic wage which they ought to receive. </para>

              <para>- They are sheltered to the extent that up to the present their emoluments have not been interfered with. When, forced by necessity, we now reduce our own allowances, there is not nearly the credit due to us, as a Parliament, that would have been ours if this gesture had been made when we first saw the financial crisis approaching. The saving involved is infinitesimal; but as a recognition that the people had suffered in their private incomes, that there had been a diminution in the national income, and that nearly every person was suffering through his pocket, such a lead by this Parliament at that time would have been more valuable than it is at this eleventh hour. </para>

            <para>. - During the discussion on the financial statement presented by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> the Government has been besieged with requests to adopt different courses of action, and overwhelmed with advice from honorable senators opposite, who have endeavoured to show in which direction its policy is wrong and why theirs is right. Because the Government has refused to accept this advice it has been condemned; but I think that any unbiased person, who considers all the circumstances, will admit that the Government is doing its best to grapple with the situation. In considering the situation from different aspects we should not lose sight of the most important factor - the responsibility for the position with which Australia is at present confronted. No honorable senator opposite has said that it is the fault of this Government or of the party which it represents. No one will have the temerity to say, in view of the short time in which this Government has been in office- </para>

              <para>- The finances of the Commonwealth went to the bad during the Bruce-Page regime to the extent of £14,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> said that a nation, like an individual, should live within its means. If the late Government had recognized that fact much earlier the position would not have been as bad as it is to-day. According to the trade bulletin published by the Commonwealth Statistician, there was a continuous drift in our overseas position during the period the late Government was in power. Prom 1923 to 1929 the adverse balance in overseas trade, including bullion and specie, was £42,236,685, and as ships' stores established a credit of £15,801,394, a net debit in our overseas trade balance of £26,000,000 remained. That is to say that during that period Australia imported goods to the value of £26,435,287 in excess of those which we exported. That, however, is an unimportant portion of the story. The great tragedy is that during that period there were huge commitments for interest overseas which could be met only by the exportation and sale overseas of Australian products. The interest payable abroad during the same period was, approximately, £154,000,000, so that during prosperous years the Commonwealth failed to balance its accounts with the outside world to the extent of £180,000,000, or at the rate of £30,000,000 per year, while the Bruce-Page Government was in office. </para>

              <para>- I am dealing with the relationship of the Commonwealth with the outside world. It is the duty of this Parliament to prevent the States doing anything detrimental to our relations with the outside world. This adverse trade balance was met by the flotation of loans abroad. Of a total overseas debt of £572,000,000, approximately £180,000,000 has, in recent years, been used to balance our trade position. There has been a release of credits in Australia which, to some extent, counterbalances that expenditure. The great difficulty which we have to face is the dead weight of interest indebtedness overseas, a considerable proportion of which was incurred by the Bruce-Page Government. The internal budget difficulty and the external trade difficulty, to which I have referred, existed when the present Government took office. When the late Government assumed control of the Commonwealth, Australia had a favorable trade balance with the rest of the world, due largely to there being an accumulation of primary products, which were sold at high prices, and also because of the operations of Bawra. Had those credits been properly used, the adverse trade balances would not have been created. When the balance of trade set against Australia, it was the duty of the then Government to take prompt steps to correct it. </para>

          <para>We are told that the Government ought to unpeg exchange. Why did not the  late Government do so between 1924 and 1929, when the exchange difficulty assumed big proportions? Why did it continue its policy of borrowing abroad, and of keeping exchange at such a low level, that it deprived the primary producers of Australia of many millions of pounds? </para>

          <para>It has been urged that the present Government should grapple with this problem in the traditional way. As that means that it should follow the policy of the late Government, which landed Australia in her present difficult position, is it to be wondered at that the present Government has refused to accept such advice? When I charged the late Government with extravagance, the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> asked me to enumerate some items of expenditure which I regarded as extravagant. I shall refer to one item, to which I have referred repeatedly since my election to this chamber - the expenditure on assisted migration. Whenever that question was raised, the reply of the late Government was that there was room in Australia for millions of people, and that we should spend money to bring them here. The following table shows the cost of the passage money of the assisted migrants who arrived in Australia between 1923, and 1929 : - </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator knows that every mail brings letters from these unfortunate migrants asking to be repatriated to the Old Country. Many of them, who despair of obtaining employment in Australia, are paying their passages back to England. I have always urged that there should be no assisted migration to Australia until opportunities have been created for the successful absorption of the migrants in industry. Those opportunities were not  created while the immigration policy was being given effect to. If, instead of spending £2,000,000 in bringing migrants to Australia, the Government had expended it in building up Australian industries, those industries would have acted like a magnet and attracted the right kind of migrant. Despite the protests of the then Opposition, the late Government continued this policy. To the extent that that policy has assisted to bring about the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, honorable senators who supported it must accept responsibility. </para>

              <para>- No government should spend money in forcing migration beyond the capacity of a country to absorb migrants. This force pump system of building up our population by holding out tempting baits in the form of assisted passages and training schemes has inflated the population of Australia beyond the country's natural capacity to absorb workers. As a result unemployment is rife. The present Government has definitely reduced expenditure on migration. It has set itself against bringing out work-seekers to compete in an. already over-crowded  labour  market. </para>

              <para>- I shall examine the figures, for the instruction of honorable senators opposite and the information of the general public. The last budget for a complete year that was presented by the Bruce-Page Government was that for the period ended the 30th June, 1929. Revenue expenditure . for that year amounted to £63,77S,746, and loan expenditure £7,735,103, making a gross expenditure of £71,513,S49. Now let me take the proposed expenditure of this Government, according to its budget, of which this financial statement is supplementary. Revenue for the year will amount to £66,300,000, and loan expenditure £2,600,000 ; a total of £68,900,000, or, approximately, £2,500,000 less than the amount expended by the Bruce-Page Government during the last financial year that it held office. </para>

              <para>- I remind the right honorable senator that it was he who introduced the custom of including both revenue and loan expenditure when examining the financial position of the nation. I submit that it is necessary to take cognizance of the two items. During the term of office of the Bruce-Page Government, when the loan expenditure of the Commonwealth, and particularly of the State Governments, was excessive, quite a considerable proportion of the country's income was derived from customs and excise duties. This Government is not so fortunate in that respect. I shall deal with some of the items which have led to the increase in revenue expenditure since the presentation of the Bruce-Page budget on the 30th June, 1929. The actual increase in expenditure from revenue provided this year, compared with that for the year ended the 30th June, 1929, amounts, in round figures, to £2,745,000. Of that amount, £1,000,000 represents increases in old-age and invalid pensions. Portion of that increase is due to additional population, but, in the main, it is attributable to the consequences of the prevailing depression. Many people who were able to subsist on their own resources, or who were supported by their families, have now been forced to fall back on the provision made by the Commonwealth Government in the form of old-age pensions. There has been an increase of nearly £200,000 in pensions to exsoldiers, and a very considerable increase in the interest bill of the Commonwealth, also a special grant of £330,000 to South Australia. A further sum of £1,000,000 was originally provided in the Scullin budget for the relief of unemployment in the States, but the other State Treasurer's have generously foregone the bulk of that amount in order that it may be used to assist the much harassed Treasurer of South Australia, the most unfortunately placed State at the present time. I am aware that that subject will be discussed when a bill is later introduced into this chamber, and I shall say no more at this juncture, except that the people of South Australia appreciate the generosity of the Commonwealth, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> generous spirit which prompted the Treasurers of the other States to forgo that money in order that it might be used to help South Australia. Those commitments, which had not to be provided for by the Bruce-Page Government in its budget, total far more than the additional expenditure from revenue of £2,750,000, which is proposed in this budget. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Some honorable senators opposite, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> levelled at the Government a charge that it was raising £12,000,000 from additional taxation this year. It is doing no such thing. It does hope to raise a little extra revenue from that source - from memory about £1,750,000 - but the bulk of the taxation which the Government has been compelled to impose is to replace other forms of revenue which it has had to forgo. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> quoted a statement allegedly made in Perth by the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> when that gentleman was <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> for the Imperial Conference, that the Government had deliberately closed certain channels of revenue in order to balance its external trade position. The Government had no alternative. It has had to ask the people of Australia to make good, from some other source, that which was lost in that direction. A comparison of the taxation which this Government proposes to levy for the current financial year will disclose that it is slightly lower than that levied by the Bruce-Page Government in the budget to which I have referred. I think that the total direct and indirect decrease amounts to 7s.11d. per head of population. </para>
          <para>So much for the criticism that has been levelled at the Government. This Government has practised economy, and has done all that it possibly can in the limited time at its disposal to bring about that budget equilibrium which is so enthusiastically advocated by honorable senators opposite; an ideal about which they were not so greatly concerned when they sat on this side of the chamber a little over twelve months ago. It is well-known that our national income has been seriously .depleted as a result of the fall in the prices of wool and wheat. Various estimates have been made by public men, by members of Parliament and by others, that that loss ranges from £30,000,000 to £100,000,000. I calculate that the actual loss is in the vicinity of £55,000,000 to £65,000,000 for this year. </para>

              <para>- The actual difference would be about' £60,000,000, including all commodities. One factor has to be taken into account when considering the effect of that on the national income. It is how that income, derived from the sale of wheat, wool, metals and other commodities, was used in bygone days and whether any change has been made in the mode of expenditure. In previous times, a very substantial portion of the national income was used to purchase luxuries from abroad, such as motor cars, grand pianos and pianolas. The huge annual commitment for fuel on which to run motor cars is also a drain on the national income. If people have the money with which to buy such luxuries, imports of that nature cannot be stopped. Unfortunately, motor cars and the fuel with which to run them are not produced in Australia, although we hope that something will be done to develop our shale oil industry and thereby render us independent of oil supplies from other parts of the world. A very large portion of the national income was also used in previous years to purchase from abroad commodities which could be, and are at present being made in Australia. One has only to glance at the huge drop in customs revenue to realize that in this respect there has been a very substantial decrease in the drain on our national income. To-day, the nation is producing many commodities which it previously paid people on the other side of the world to produce. To that extent ive are better off. That provides a measure of employment in Australia and circulates among our own people money that was formerly circulated among the people of other countries. </para>

              <para>- My constituents are under no misapprehension concerning my views on protection. As regards the commodities which can be economically manufactured or produced in Australia, I am a prohibitionist. I believe that most of our staple requirements in the form of clothing, ordinary timber manufactures, boots and shoes, as well as a number of other lines which, for many years, have figured largely in our list of imports, can be' produced in Australia at a cost that will compare favorably with the prices of the imported commodities. The manufacture of blankets may be cited as a case in point. Until the tariff on woollen goods was increased by this Government our importations of blankets were very heavy. </para>

              <para>- I repeat that, for the last five or six years, our imports in blankets have been considerable. But to-day, as a result of this Government's policy, importations have ceased, and the prices charged for Australian blankets compare more than favorably with the cost of the imported article. I am informed that with the introduction of a slightly greater measure of mass production and a little better organization, it should be possible for our manufacturers of blankets to market their product overseas. </para>

              <para>- This Government, by the enforcement of its tariff policy, is giving Australian secondary industries a chance to establish themselves on a sound basis. Unfortunately, because of the prevailing depression, they are not able to expand to the extent that would have been possible, if this opportunity had been made available to them in former years of good seasons and high prices. This is one reason why the effect, on employment of this Government's tariff policy, is not as pronounced as it was hoped it would be. But in the discussion of this problem we should consider what the unemployment figures would have been if the Government had not taken somewhat drastic action to safeguard Australian industries. Many would have been closed down and our employment difficulty would have been much more serious than it is to-day. Advocates of freetrade, and there is still a limited number, appear to ignore the effect of such a policy upon our secondary industries. Honorable senators opposite are continually referring to the value to the Commonwealth of our great staple industries. We, on this side, admit that sustained production of wool and wheat on an economic basis means much for the prosperity of this country. But an examination of the figures, to be found in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> for 1929, will disclose that our secondary industries are responsible for a considerable proportion of the wealth produced in the Commonwealth, and they must also be credited with providing employment for large numbers of operatives who, in their turn, are consumers of the products of our primary industries. The number of persons employed in our secondary industries in 1929 was 464,000, the wages paid to them amounted to £91,000,000, the value added to the raw materials in the process of manufacture was estimated at £167,000,000 and the value of the total output of the secondary industries for that year was £417,000,000. Practically the whole of the raw material used in our secondary industries, valued at £159,000,000, was produced in Australia. It is estimated, further, that the production of these raw materials required by our secondary industries gave employment to another 300,000 persons. </para>

          <para>Some years ago the Bruce-Page Government appointed an Economic Advisory Committee of experts to inquire into and report on the economic effects of the tariff. After a careful investigation the committee came to the opinion that under freetrade conditions approximately one-half of the secondary industries of the Commonwealth would have been eliminated. As a result, the national income would have been reduced by £129,000,000 per annum because we should have been obliged to pay that sum to manufacturers in other countries for the production of commodities which under our system of protection, we now manufacture in this country, and the persons employed in those secondary industries would have been obliged to turn their attention to other avocations. I think we may safely assume that they could not have been fully absorbed by our primary industries. </para>

              <para>- But I am speaking of the general effect of our tariff policy, and my remarks have particular reference to arguments adduced by one or two honorable senators opposite, who urged that we should abandon protection and revert to a policy of freetrade. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>This Government has done what it set out to do. It has checked the flood of imports, and has done something to stimulate our secondary industries. By its action it lias prevented a further drift in the national income to the extent of approximately £30,000,000 or £40,000,000. We propose to pursue this policy, because we believe that only in this way will it be possible to reach budget equilibrium. Obviously it is impossible to balance the budget while we have an army of about 200,000 unemployed. The Government has been criticized because it believes that it is impossible to balance its budget unless it can ensure the profitable employment of the great majority of those who are at present out of work. The history of these attempts in some of the States to balance budgets, demonstrates the truth of what I am saying. In my own State, for example, we all remember the enthusiasm with which a young Treasurer, who swept the polls in 1927, set to work to square the State ledger. We had a special session of Parliament for that purpose; but at the end of the financial year, despite heroic attempts on the part of the Treasurer to secure economies, and despite also the burdensome taxation which was imposed upon the people, the deficit was the greatest in the history of South Australia. Since then there have been successive deficits, which to-day threaten to overwhelm the State Treasurer. That attempt to balance the budget was responsible for increased unemployment in South Australia at a time when the problem was almost negligible in the other States, and unhappily the position in that State is so acute to-day that about 60,000 people are living on rations provided by the Government. This number includes about 20,000 wage-earners, who, although willing and anxious to work, are unable to find employment. They are costing the State in relief £14,500 a week. </para>
          <para>I invite honorable senators opposite to demonstrate how it is possible to balance budgets when unemployment is so acute in all the States. These workless people, besides being a burden to their government, are themselves non-taxpayers. It is estimated that every adult person, by indirect taxation through the customs, contributes between £6 and £7 to the Commonwealth revenue. Obviously, the 60,000 persons who are living on rations in South Australia are not contributing their quota. Their expenditure on necessaries of life and other commodities has been curtailed by probably 50 per cent., so that on a conservative estimate the loss to the Commonwealth Government, from this source alone, is, at least, £150,000 a year. The State Government is also losing heavily through reduced income taxation and other charges. This Government is endeavouring by the exercise of wise economy and by increasing the Commonwealth revenue wherever possible, without making taxation too burdensome on the people, to achieve a measure of financial equilibrium - if not to actually balance the budget to at least get within striking distance of doing so, and at the same time cultivate an ability to increase employment by which the number of taxpayers may be increased. In that way the burden may be spread over more shoulders and made to fall lighter on the individual. That is the only sound policy to be adopted by any government in getting Australia out of its financial difficulties. </para>
          <para>We are asked, " How are you going to do this?"; and we have been subjected to quite a lot of criticism because, among other things, it has been suggested by us that a measure of credit expansion may be practised. I propose to show that there is nothing terrible in the measure of credit expansion propounded by members of the Labour party, and that experience shows that the prophecies made to-day will prove to be false, as were those which were made when a previous Labour government was taking the initial steps to establish the Commonwealth Bank, and to issue Australian notes. One wonders why some of these criticisms were not levelled at the governments which controlled Australia during the war, because if ever there was a material inflation of currency in Australia, it occurred during that period. It is, therefore, advisable in examining this subject to consider what occurred during the war and see whether the prophecies made to-day are in any way substantiated by the experience of the war years. We are told to-day that there are three objections' to a policy of credit expansion; that if credit is expanded we shall not be able to find profitable work to do; that the cost of living will be increased; and that a tremendous burden will be imposed upon the export industries. I shall deal with these seriatim. </para>
          <para>Dealing with the first objection, that profitable work could not be found from the credit made available, I venture to say that a restriction of the circulation of the monetary power of Australia has been responsible for a great deal of the unemployment that exists to-day, and that if steps were taken to loosen credit a definite move forward in the absorption of our people in profitable employment and increased production would follow. In South Australia we have had three years drought over the whole of our pastoral areas, and in some districts it has continued for five years. The result is that holdings have been denuded of stock, improvements have fallen into a state of disrepair, and what was formerly a great and prosperous industry is to-day in a very parlous condition. Twelve months ago, while the drought still continued, we told ourselves - and we fondly believed that we were telling ourselves the truth - that as soon as the drought broke there would be a material improvement in the prosperity of the State. The drought has broken, and to-day there are fields of luxurious fodder waving in the wind where twelve months ago there were dust holes producing something most unpleasant to face in the form of daily dust storms that made the lives of the people in those areas a veritable hell upon earth. But from an economic stand-point the State is no better off to-day with its fields of grass than it was with its dust holes, because there is no money available for restocking. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> Pastoralists have not been able to restock their holdings. Honorable senators opposite say that it is useless to re-stock thém: because wool cannot be produced at present day costs. They say that, unless working costs can be reduced, the wool growing industry must go by the board. My opinion is that at prevailing values for sheep these holdings can be profitably restocked, and that even with low prices ruling, wool can be profitably produced. But nothing can be done until the holdings are restocked. In the north, north-west and north-east of South Australia the restocking of these holdings would lead to the direct employment of between 1,000 and 1,500 men who were formerly employed on the properties, and the seasonal employment of many others who were engaged at shearing, and in many other directions in days gone by. </para>
          <para>Among those who have been chosen to fill the role of advisers to the Government, and say that wages must be reduced, are many chairmen of directors of stock and station firms, and directors of banking institutions. What contribution have they made towards the rehabilitation of the pastoral industry? When the price of wool was high during the war, and when stock was bringing high prices, the former raised their commission rate for the sale of wool by a fraction of 1 per cent., and for the sale of stock by 1 per cent., and they have not yet brought down those rates. Ear from making any sacrifice to rehabilitate the pastoral industry or reduce costs, which they are imploring others to do, banking institutions have recently raised their overdraft rates by 1 per cent. . That is their contribution towards the rehabilitation of the industry. In the face of such hypocrisy are we to stand idly by and do nothing to endeavour to rectify the position ? Are we to allow these financial institutions, which undoubtedly do control Australia at the present time, to maintain their control and drive the country to the verge of national insolvency, if not actually into that pitfall? Or should we not take some steps, not to annihilate these people or impose any injustice upon them, or deprive them of anything which is their legitimate right, but to compel them to recognize their responsibility to the community just as the community recognizes its responsibility to them? That, put briefly, is the policy which the Labour party proposes to pursue, and which, if adopted, would, in my opinion, solve our difficulties in this country. </para>
          <para>The second objection raised is that an expansion of credit would lead to an increase in the cost of living. At the beginning of the war the Australian note issue was approximately £9,500,000'. By June, 1915, it had increased to £32,000,000, and at the end of the war it was as high as £55,500,000. Was there any talk of inflation then? </para>

              <para>- The note issue continued to increase until 1921, when it was £58,250,000. At that time the population was about 5,500,000 and the note issue per head of the population was thus, approximately, £11. On. the 30th June last the population of Australia was, approximately, 6,500,000, and the note issue by then had been reduced to £45,000,000, or approximately £7 per head of the population. If the figures for the last year of the Bruce-Page Government are taken the comparison is even worse. The note issue was then £42,000,000, or a little over £6 per head of the population. In considering this deflation of the note issue we have also to consider how the other available monetary wealth of Australia is held; that is to say, how the nation's working capital is distributed. We find that the fluidity of the monetary wealth of Australia has been reduced by over 50 per cent, since 1921. In that year we had £13,000,000 more notes in circulation than we have to-day, but, in addition to that the monetary wealth of Australia wa3 much more fluid than at present. The amount in the trading banks on current account was £128,000,000, and ,the amount on fixed deposit was £119,500,000. There was thus a balance in favour of current account over fixed deposits of ' £8,500,000. On the 30th June last the amount in the trading banks on current account was £103,500,000, and the amount on fixed deposit was £206,500,000, the balance being in favour of fixed deposits to the extent of £103,000,000. From 1921-30 there was thus a tendency to withdraw the nation's working capital out of those avenues where it could be used to provide employment or help in wealth production and place it in avenues where it could not be so readily accessible for those purposes. I venture to say that that factor has had a great deal to do with the prevailing unemployment in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that" that is correct. The return from a permanent investment has become too great in comparison with the profits derived from industry, and unless a readjustment can be made there is little hope for this country. The road to readjustment is not along the lines suggested by honorable senators opposite, but is to be found in the policy of this Government. If, as we have been told, inflation means high prices, why did not the increase in the note issue of £3,000,000 during the past twelve months increase the cost of living in Australia? The reverse has been the case. Instead of the living costs increasing there has been a decrease of approximately 15 per cent, in wholesale prices during that period. There are two schools of economists today. One holds to the belief that monetary power should really be the master of production and trade and commerce as it is to-day, and the other that it ought to be its servant. The only school entitled to consideration is the latter. </para>

Do honorable senators opposite realize that if we deflate to the 1919 basis, it will take all the revenue collected in taxation at the present rate to meet the interest on our public debt, leaving nothing for the maintenance of those great services which are now provided by the Commonwealth and the States? </para>

We are not the custodian of world politics and world conditions, but only of those which affect Australia.

          <para class="block">He contends that deflation has got out of hand. That is what honorable senators on this side say. We contend that some means of restoration must be adopted to provide for balancing our budget over a longer period. The present low prices for wheat and wool will not be permanent.' There are already signs that the price of wool will improve in the near future, and it can be definitely asserted that we cannot continue to produce wheat at the prices now prevailing. This Government has been condemned because, in effecting economies, it has not attacked the wage principle which has been, definitely established as a result of the application of the policy of the Labour party. Because we believe that the Australian people support that policy, we shall not attack the conditions enjoyed by a .great mass of the public servants. We have been told that we have been delinquent in our duty to the community. Lot us see what those who are supposed to occupy sheltered positions in the Public Service are receiving. The minimum and maximum salaries of certain, ern.ployees in the Postal Department are as follows:- Postmen, £212 to £244; mail sorters, £212-£295; telegraphists, £232-' £306; linesmen, £233-£257.

              <para>- They are receiving a lower wage than those performing similar work outside. Moreover, their duties at times necessitate travelling at inconvenience and expense, which reduces their small remuneration. What are the extra emoluments they receive? For the whole of the Postal Department, which embraces the bulk of the Public Service, the extraneous payments for the year 1928-29 were £573,000, or an average of approximately £18 per employee. We are not going  to  attack the standard of these people, because we believe that their wages or conditions of employment should not be arbitrarily altered by this Parliament. Many of the postal employees and other public servants had to wait for years to obtain a determination from the Public Service Arbitrator or any such tribunal. In these circumstances, they should not be subject to arbitrary action by this legislature. We intend to adhere to the principle of arbitration, which, if departed from, will lead to many complications." If we admit the right of Parliament to interfere with the basic wage standards established by  arbitration tribunals when the country is in a bad way financially, then we must admit the, right of Parliament to interfere with those standards in times of prosperity. Do honorable senators opposite argue that the National Parliament should become a wage-fixing machine? The Governmentbelieves that its policy will free Australiafrom the difficulties which beset it to-day,, and that the way to budget equilibrium and prosperity lies in the employment of our people so that they may earn incomes', and, consequently, become taxpayers. It believes that the restriction of credit i3 in a measure responsible for the present depression, and that the position can be relieved by an extension of credit facilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch has admitted that there was inflation during the war.

Even if the bridge we build is only a temporary structure, it will be sufficient to carry us over the stream. The world will soon be forced to move. Goods are piling up in the world's warehouses, not because there is too much wealth in 'the world, but because there is too little. There are men and women who desirework,but cannot find it; there are thousands who starve in the midst of plenty. The Labour party does not stand for a continuance of these conditions. The Government will prevent old-world conditions from being established in this young country. Just as the prophecies of the evil effects of the application of the former policy were proved to be incorrect, so will the prophecies of to-day also prove to be wrong.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM</inline>GLASGOW (Queensland) [5.40]. - I should not have spoken had it not been for some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline> in the early part of his speech. The honorable senator criticized the late Government's financial policy; he charged it with haying been extravagant in the expenditure of both loan and revenue moneys. The Bruce-Page Government came into power in 1922, in which year the loan indebtedness of the Commonwealth amounted to £364,839,590. At that time  a Labour  government was in office in Queensland, which State had then a public debt of £85,691,228. The public debt for all the States at the 30th of June, 1922, amounted to £519,537,643. At the 30th of June, 1929, the loan indebtedness of the Commonwealth stood at £377,621,572 ; that of Queensland had increased to £113,355,041, while that of all the States had increased to £726,406,490. During those seven years the public debt  of  the Commonwealth increased by £12,781,982 ; that of Queensland by £27,663,813. and that of all the States by £206,868,847. </para>
          <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that the increase for Queensland was more than  double that for the Commonwealth. Those figures show that, compared with the Queensland Labour Government, the Bruce-Page Government was not extravagant in the expenditure of loan money. </para>
          <para>Let us now look at the position from another stand-point - that of the debt per head of the population. At the 30th of June, 1922, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> debt of the Commonwealth was £65.539; that of Queensland £108.659 ; and that of all the States £93.439. Seven years later the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> debt was £59.251, £122.564 and £114.202 respectively. Thus it will be seen that, whereas under the Bruce-Page Administration the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> debt of the Commonwealth decreased by £6 5s. 10d., that of Queensland increased by £13 18s.1d., and that of all the States by £20 15s. 3d. </para>
          <para>Now let us examine the honorable senator's charge that the Bruce-Page Government was extravagant in its expenditure from revenue. That Government went out of office in October, 1929. Its expenditure from revenue during 1928-29 was £4,000,000 less than the estimated expenditure of the present Government for this year. On the 21st of November, 1929, the Scullin Government, in order to make up a shortage of revenue, introduced new taxation proposals, which involved an estimated increase of revenue from customs amounting to £2,750,000. Further additions to the revenue from the same source were estimated at £1,200,000. It imposed a super tax on incomes, which was expected to yield an additional £1,285,000 and from the liquidation of ex-enemy properties, it anticipated receiving £1,200,000. The total estimated additional revenue from the sources mentioned amounted to £6,435,000. The budget proposals introduced by the Treasurer in July last included an estimated increase of revenue from various sources amounting to £14,050,000. I emphasize that these were the proposals of a Government which when its members were sitting in opposition, charged the late Government with having imposed excessive taxation on the people. Rather than make a genuine effort to reduce expenditure, the present Government preferred to levy an  additional £14,050,000 on the people. It certainly reduced expenditure . in one direction, for it cut down the defence expenditure to the bone; but the savings in other departments are practically nil. The Government's action is a breach of its promise to. the Premiers of the States, <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> the conference held in Melbourne in August last, to reduce expenditure by £4,000,000. It has kept that promise only to the extent of reducing departmental expenditure by £65,000, thus placing the burden of balancing the budget solely on the taxpayer. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Halloran</inline>said that the Government would not ask those public servants receiving less than £725 per annum to make any sacrifice. </para>

              <para>--Public servants in receipt of salaries in excess of £'725 per annum are being specially taxed, whereas those whose remuneration is less than that amount are not asked to make any special contribution. Other sections of the taxpayers are being called upon to make very heavy sacrifices; indeed, many of them have difficulty in making ends meet. Next year their capacity to pay taxes will probably have disappeared, for they will have no income to tax. Let me point out the serious position of the wool-growers of this country. The following table shows the returns from the fleece of each sheep from 1922 to the present time : - </para>

            <para>Seeing that Australia is not isolated and is dependent to a large degree upon overseas market, the seriousness of the position lies in the fact that the cost of production in competing countries has declined while the costa in Australia generally have risen - thus increasing the already wide margin of difference between the costs in overseas countries and those in Australia. </para>

It is impossible to continue producing all of our important commodities, wool, wheat, metals, &amp;c, if that condition of affairs is to continue.

              <para>- Certainly not. That was apparent from the manner in which some of my colleagues criticized and voted against the Government during the Bruce-Page regime. We have now been in session for more than a month, and the only bill that the Government has brought down in this chamber is one which sought to impose an embargo on galvanized iron ! That is conclusive proof that the will of caucus predominates, and that the Government is a negligible factor. I am confident that if it would take heart and pursue the policy that it knows to be right, there would be an improvement in the value of our stocks, and the confidence of the investors in Australia would be restored. The investing public merely require to be assured that the Government is doing the fair thing, by keeping its expenditure within reasonable limits. The Government is entitled to impose a certain amount of taxation, but the exorbitant impositions that it contemplates will ha,ve ,ii serious adverse effect on the welfare of the nation. They will eventually operate to the disadvantage of those whom the Government is trying to protect, as the finances of the country will become worse and worse until, in addition to a salary reduction, there will be considerable retrenchments in the Public Service. </para>

            <para>. -  Before a paper so important as this is printed it is as well that I should say a few words upon its contents. In the first place, we know that this supplementary budget would not have seen the light of day were it not for the fact that the finances of Australia took a turn for the worse immediately after Parliament last went into recess. It was thought  that there would be no need to call us together again until 1931, but the calculations and pious hopes of the Ministry were confounded, and the drift continued. It is quite clear that " something is rotten in the State of Denmark". "What is it? There is nothing wrong with our country. It is as fertile and as well blessed by a benign Providence as it has been at any time since the white man set foot upon it. The climate is all right; the seasons, too, are all right. The difficulty must rest with the people. In the early 'nineties Australia went through just as perilous times as those which now confront it. Then there was a very serious curtailment of credit, prices of agricultural produce were deplorably low, financial institutions were unable to square their ledgers, and employment was rife. But the position was quickly adjusted, because the people of those days were of stronger moral fibre than are the people of to-day. What is the matter with the people of to-day? Just this: They have been listening, all too obligingly, to a band of social reformers who have sprung into existence like mushrooms, almost over night, fanatics who. have inculcated in the minds of the general public the delusion that we are about to witness the birth of a new era. They have been directed to this new Garden of Eden just over the hill with a finger post at the bottom, and have been told that all that is necessary for them to do to enjoy its fruits is to claim more and more of their share of the products of industry than they have been receiving in the past. Whence came this band of reformers no one can say. All we know is that they came from all points of the compass, from lands where they were no longer wanted, and have been advising the workers to combine for the purpose of getting more and still more of the fruits of industry regardless of what becomes of that industry. Strange as it may seem, this pernicious doctrine is still being preached on every hand. Even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> - that poor, lone man who departed from these shores on an important mission a few months ago, leaving behind him ministerial colleagues who were unable to stand up to the agreement which he made - even he told the workers of this country not so long ago that their share of the fruits of industry should be increased. </para>

              <para>- In the sense that I have implied before, the organized worker, I repeat, has been getting more from industry than has been his due.I know, of course, that in saying this, I am taking my political life in my hands. With me this is not a new experience. It is easy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to speak of the worker - with a capital " W " as high as the roof of this chamber - it is easy for him and those who think with him to persuade the organized workers of this country that they have been, and are being, ill-treated by industry, and that they must organize to squeeze more out of it. But that very attitude and policy are responsible for the misery of to-day. Such attempts as these have landed us in our present position. Prices for our primary products are now so low that it will require the united efforts of the whole of the people to right the situation that confronts us. But we have passed through similar crises before in the history of this country, the only noticeable difference to-day being evidence of an entirely different spirit in the industrial field, as compared with that in earlier years. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to search the records dealing with the prices paid for our primary products. If he does, he will find that, at one stage in our history, wheat was as low as ls. 8d. a bushel in Victoria. We have not reached that level yet. Wool also was sold as low as 7d. a lb. We are close to, if not right at, that position to-day. There were no throngs of unemployed then, nor were there free food depots. As I have said, there was a different spirit abroad in those days. The people faced the situation courageously with the result that the crisis was hardly precipitated before the means to meet it were adopted and the country was on the up grade. The Australian citizen of those days, true to the spirit of his forefathers, faced the situation with a firm determination to overcome his difficulties, with the result that the depression was lifted in short order. </para>

          <para>To-day, a crisis of great magnitude faces us, but because the pioneering spirit of our forebears has oozed out or been sadly watered down, to meet it is a totally different proposition. To-day we have the spectacle of State Governments being in danger of having their cheques returned marked " n.s.f . ", simply because this Government and its supporters will not face the realities of the situation. So I say that there is nothing wrong with this country - nothing wrong with its productivity or the seasons - but there is something very much wrong with the spirit of its people. They have been listening over-long to the false voice of those " sooner " reformers, who have come among us within the last fifteen or twenty years. I say it with regret that they have listened to the advice of these people to their own undoing. What is urgently needed now to put Australia again on the road to prosperity is hard thinking, not foolish thinking; hard work, and not slack work; hard saving, and no more extravagance. We want these things very badly. Especially should we take good care to avoid the printing press and the oil can which some people would use to lubricate the financial machinery of the nation for the production of wealth. History teaches us that wealth created in this way will be so much waste paper in the end. We cannot expect to return to prosperity along this path. It lias been tried, before and proved to be a false road. In fact, it is a roguish road. Honorable senators on this side, who have been warning the people of the dangers that confront them, are not blind to the teachings of history. They know that these alternatives to hard work, honest thinking and frugality have been tried and found wanting. </para>

              <para>- Of course. They suggest the adoption of this expedient because they know that the honest truth about the situation is unpalatable and unacceptable. This is why they have the advantage of honorable senators on this side. They rely, apparently, upon a seemingly inexhaustible fund of human credulity when they appeal to their supporters in these terms. </para>

          <para>One of the previous speakers in this debate referred to the recent New South Wales elections. What a perfect farce it is to speak of that thing as an election. In truth it was a public auction. The credulity of the public was put up for auction to the highest bogus bidder. One candidate said, "I will give so and so." He had his " but toners " in the crowd, with the result that when he promised the farmers 5s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat, another man went one better by offering 3s. 6d., and the upshot was' that the promised price went up to 7s. 6d. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a very simple and noncontroversial measure providing for increasing the charges for the services which the Patents Office renders the public. Since this office was first established in 1903 it has grown considerably. Its chief item of expenditure is the cost of examination of applications for patents and the cost of printing. There are about 1 00 employees and the work they do is astonishing. I had occasion to do some business in the office the other day in connexion with a patent a young man was trying to put through and I got an excellent idea of the work which they do. Incidentally I learned that the staff was delighted that it was not to be transferred to Canberra. The main purpose of the bill is the revision of the fees payable in connexion with the granting of patents. These have remained unaltered since the first Patents Act in 1903. It will be realized that since that date costs of administration have increased, and accordingly a scale of charges deemed to be reasonable in 1903 is quite insufficient today. Printing costs £14,000 a year; double what it cost in pre-war days. In 1904 four examiners were employed whereas to-day 36 are necessary. This is, however, not an index to the increase in the number of applications for patents. The number of applications received annually is only a little more than double the number received 20 years ago, but the necessity to employ nine times as large a staff to deal with only double the number of applications is attributed to the increased scope of the searches to be made, a factor which will continue until the provision in section 60 of the act, under which specifications more than 50 years old are, in certain circumstances, not a bar to a patent, comes into full play as applied to specifications filed under the Commonwealth act. While it is not desired to impose any unnecessary tax on inventions, it is considered that the granting of a patent should, in the present time of financial stress, bear some small share of the burden. The Government is anxious to spread the burden over as wide a field as possible. The immediate increases which are provided for in the bill will be payable by persons who apply for patents after the date of the commencement of the act, but the increase which is provided for in regard to renewal fees will not come about immediately. It will take effect in five years because the first renewal fee under the bill is to be payable on the expiration of the fifth year of the period of the patent. I understand that a fee of £1 is paid on the submission of an application and that upon the granting of the patent, a further fee of £2 is paid and the patent has a currency of sixteen years, but another fee has to be paid at the end of five years and if it is not paid the patent lapses. No additional revenue can be expected for the next five years from renewal fees. The fees which may be expected to produce some additional revenue within those five years are - </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) A fee of £2 payable on lodging a complete specification after a provisional specification, and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Where a complete specification is filed in the first instance, a fee of £3 as against the fee of £1 which is at present in force. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The present scale of fees is defective in that it provides for a fee of £1 only on any application up to but not including the stage of the acceptance of the complete specification, when the scale provides for a fee of £2. If, however, the office on examination of the specification as to prior patenting or as to novelty, rejects the application, no additional fee is payable. In such cases the fee of £1 is quite inadequate. The principal cost to the office in connexion with dealing with applications for patents is the cost of examination, and a complicated invention may quite conceivably occupy the attention of an examiner for a long period. It is therefore proposed that, in addition to the acceptance-fee now payable, a fee shall be payable on lodgment of the complete specification. It is considered that, as the first of the renewal fees will not be payable until five years from the date of the patent, it is reasonable that additional revenue should be derived from this source. Presumably, a patentee will in the ordinary course have had a reasonable time in which to exploit his invention, and the fee then to be paid would presumably be from receipts from the monopoly which he enjoys. It seems reasonable that in such cases the patentee should be asked to make an additional contribution to the Consolidated Revenue. The department is to give persons who have sufficient intellect to invent something of service to the community a sufficient time in which to exploit their invention. I have been informed by the department that most of the inventions are submitted by comparatively poor men. A patent was recently applied for by a young working tradesman which stood every test, and which, under ordinary conditions, would have sold readily; but at the present time, when so many are afraid to put their hands in their pockets because of the possible presence of a death adder, it is difficult to sell anything. The only other alterations for which this bill provides are in the form of Letters Patent. The first is to substitute the Commonwealth Arms for the Royal Arms, and the second to substitute the present for the old form of the King's title. I do not think that there is anything controversial in the measure, which has been framed in an attempt to enable the Patents Office, which is conducted for the convenience of the public, to obtain more revenue than at present. The Government cannot afford to employ a staff of 100 under the present scale of fees, as the work involved in dealing with every application, many of which are rejected, is very heavy. In the circumstances the Government is of the opinion that fees more in keeping with the service rendered should be paid by those who apply for patents. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline>GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [8.18].  -  I am under the impression that it was the intention of the previous Government to introduce an amending measure of this nature. It is a fact that the cost of administering the patents branch has increased tremendously since 1903, and even under the rates now proposed Australia will be one of the cheapest countries in which to patent an invention. It is also apparent, as the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> said, that the principal cost is in the initiation of a patent. The fees now proposed will not in any sense recoup the department for the cost of conducting searches. The fee which is to be paid subsequent to the application-fee is higher, because such a fee would be payable only after the invention had proved to be a success. In these circumstances I do not think there will be any opposition to the bill. </para>

          <para class="block">The principal object of this bill is to alter the basis of the general deduction allowable in respect of income derived  from property. The proposed alteration is one of the Government's three proposals to obtain additional revenue from income tax. The other two proposals, which will be contained in the Income Tax Bill dealing with rates of income tax, are - </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>to increase last year's rate of tax on income from personal exertion by 15 per cent. (in lieu of the 10 per cent. imposed last session), in the case of taxable incomes exceeding £500; and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>to impose a super tax of7½ per cent. (1s. 6d. in the £1) on all interest, rents, dividends, royalties and all other income from property. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>As regards the proposal in this bill for the alteration of the general deduction from property income, it may be noted that at present there is a general deduction of £300 from the total net income, whether that income is derived from personal exertion or property or from both sources. That deduction diminishes by £1 for every £3 by which the total net income exceeds £300, so that the deduction disappears where the total net income is £1,200. It is not proposed to alter the existing law in the case of incomes derived wholly from personal exertion. </para>
          <para>In the case of incomes derived wholly from property, it was originally proposed that the deduction should be £100, diminishing by £1 for every £1 by which the income exceeded £100, and hence disappearing at £200. After the introduction of the bill in another place, the Government decided to increase the deduction to £200, diminishing £1 for £1 so that it would disappear at £400. During the debate in committee, the Government agreed to alter the rate of diminution to £1 by every £2 by which the income exceeds £200, with the result that, under the bill as it now stands, the deduction from property income will disappear when the net income from that source reaches £600. </para>
          <para>In the case of income derived partly from personal exertion and partly from property, a deduction for each of the two sources of income will, in the first place, be calculated on the assumption that the total income is derived from that source, and the amount so calculated will be reduced to the same proportion of that amount as the income from that source bears to the total income, namely - </para>

          <para class="block">These alterations of the general deduction are provided for in clause 3 of the bill. Apart from a provision to remedy a drafting oversight in clause 5, the remaining provisions of the bill are either - </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The provisions incidental to the alteration of the general deduction are contained in clause 4, which empowers the Commissioner to call for returns from persons deriving income from property, and whose total income is £200 or over. As regards the proposed super tax, clause 2 will prevent shareholders, who, under the Bates Bill, will be exempt from the proposed super tax on dividends paid out of income upon which the super tax is paid by the company, from obtaining, in addition to that exemption, a rebate of the super tax paid by the company; while clause 5 is designed to prevent mortgagees from passing on their liability for income tax on mortgage interest to their mortgagors. The last-mentioned clause amends section 94, which applies only to mortgages of land, and as the result of a decision of the High Court it is unable to achieve its original purpose. The proposal to impose a tax of ls. 6d. in the £1 on all interest makes it important that the section should be made effective, and also that it should be extended to apply to mortgages of every kind - -every charge, lien or encumbrance to secure the repayment of money upon which interest is payable. </para>
          <para>Honorable senators are well aware of the  serious position which confronts this country. They know that it is now almost impossible for the Commonwealth to carry out the resolution passed at the conference of Premiers held in Melbourne in August, and balance its budget this year. The Government is, however, making an honest attempt to as nearly as possible balance its budget. The taxation proposals of a government are never popular, whether the imposts be heavy or light. There seems to be a natural disinclination to pay taxes ; the person who runs along to pay his levies before they become due is indeed rare. The position which faces us is, however, so critical, that the Government feels that every citizen should do his share. It has, therefore, searched for means of increasing its revenue; but it has endeavoured not to make the burden of taxation intolerable. It will extract as much from the people as it feels it can legitimately ask tl em to pay, so that it will get as near as possible to balancing its budget. We are all more or less agitated about the country's financial position; but recriminations will not get us very far. We should work together as citizens whose desire is to serve their country, rather than act as partisans in politics. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">This bill proposes to give some assistance to South Australia, whose financial position is worse than that of the other States, chiefly because of the droughts from which the central State has suffered in recent years. South Australia's wealth is derived principally from wheat, sheep and cattle. The cattle country is in the north of the State, where the droughts have been most severe. The wheat belt is chiefly confined to the middle districts of the State, which, unfortunately, have not escaped the droughts. In good seasons the northern portion .of South Australia produces large quantities of grain ; but for three years there has been practically no crop there. Consequently, the revenue of the State has fallen considerably. The previous Government recognized the claims of South Australia and agreed that' a grant of £1,000,000, spread over a period of three years, was justified. South Australia has suffered from over-borrowing more than the other States have done. The Government of South Australia also claims that that State suffers serious disabilities as a result of federation, although I do not know that the Commonwealth Government admits that claim. We frequently hear complaints from the States that they have suffered by reason of federation; but, personally, I should regard as a backward step any attempt to get back to pre-federation conditions. Rather do I hope that the time will soon come when there will be a federated Australia, with but one Parliament controlling it. Of course, matters of local administration would be left to the States. In 1929 a royal commission  investigated  the position of South Australia under federation, and recommended a grant of £500,000 a year for two years. The late Government proposed that South Australia should be assisted to the extent of £1,000,000, spread over three years. That proposal was contingent on the Red Hill to Salisbury railway being handed over to the Commonwealth. As honorable senators know, that railway would provide a more direct route between Adelaide and Port Augusta than that now traversed, and would save passengers nine hours of unnecessary travelling. After the present Government came into office, Parliament agreed to a grant of £1,000,000 being made to South Australia, £360,000 to be paid in 1929-30, £320,000 in 1930-31, and £320,000 in 1931-32. Notwithstanding this assistance, the position of South Australia in 1929-30 was much worse than in previous years; its deficit for that year amounted to £1,625,000 as compared with £275,000 for 1927-2S, and £931,000 for 1928-29. At the August conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in Melbourne, a resolution was passed that all governments should balance their budgets for this year. The Premier of South Australia stated that, despite increased taxation and economies, he would require a further £1,000,000 to balance his budget. The other States agreed to help South Australia; and subsequently a further resolution was passed under which they agreed to forgo certain grants from the Commonwealth aggregating £850,000; and the Commonwealth agreed to pay that sum to South Australia. I believe that that has 'been done. It was agreed at the Melbourne conference that the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments should confer regarding the balance of £150,000 required to complete the £1,000,000 requested by South Australia. It was contemplated at the time that that amount should be made good, if possible, by South Australia, or alternatively by South Australia and the Commonwealth, acting conjointly. No definite arrangement has yet been made and the matter is still in abeyance. It has not been possible for the Commonwealth Government to examine the budget proposals of South Australia thoroughly to see whether this sum could be provided by South Australia herself. Moreover, the position of the Commonwealth has become more difficult iu the meantime and the new budget proposals will not secure a balanced budget for this year. It would seem wrong for the Commonwealth to increase its deficit merely to balance the budget of South Australia, but the matter will be further investigated before the 30th June, 1931. The Government has requested the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the claim of South Australia for further assistance from the Commonwealth. That body, which was appointed by the Commonwealth Parliament, is well qualified to examine this problem exhaustively, and to report the actual position to the Government. The first review of the South Australian budget showed a deficit of approximately £3,000,000. Measures to balance the budget included the following: - </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">It will be noted that South Australia has budgeted for a grant from the Commonwealth of £1,000,000, whereas that now proposed is £850,000. As already indicated, no definite arrangement has yet been made to cover the difference of £150,000. Since the budget was presented certain arbitration awards have been made which, it is anticipated,  will  result in further savings. I believe that rates of pay are being reduced, a procedure which is unpalatable to me. </para>
          <para>I have clearly indicated the position of South Australia. Unless help is granted to that State, it will be in a desperate plight. The purpose of the hill is to allow it to adjust its own affairs, and to save it from becoming a mendicant; to enable it to hold up its head on terms of equality with the other States. There is promise of better seasons in South Australia and, with reasonable prices for its stock and produce, there is every likelihood of that State regaining a satisfactory financial position. Although for the moment the price of wheat is exceptionally low, authorities hold out the hope that, while perhaps it may not bring the price that was contemplated by the wheat Marketing Bill, it will return a satisfactory profit to the producers. The hill should commend itself to honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. </para>

              <para>- It has, and I suppose the process will be repeated in this chamber. The bill has been introduced in accordance with the decision of the Government to impose a tax on the salaries of members of Parliament and Ministers, and also of higher-paid Commonwealth officials. The first group comprises parliamentary allowances and salaries, and, in this instance, the tax will apply to the allowances of all senators and members. In the case of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, the  President  of the Senate, the  Chairman  of Committees, and the Leader of the Opposition in either House, the tax will apply to the salary attaching to the office which he holds. The officers in the second group will include every public servant whose salary exceeds £725 per annum, and is paid from the Commonwealth public account or the North Australia Commission Fund, unless the officer concerned is employed by the Commonwealth in any territory which is not part of the Commonwealth, and where the revenues are raised within that territory for its own purposes. This group embraces officers of the Development and Migration Commission, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Commonwealth Railways, the War Service Homes Commission, the Repatriation Commission, the North Australia Commission, the Naval, Military and Air Forces, and the Public Service generally, as well as the High Commissioner, and the CommissionerGeneral in the United States.It does not include officers of the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Shipping Board, the Dried Fruits Control Board and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. The Administrator of Norfolk Island and the administrators and officers of the Papuan and New Guinea services are also excluded. It does not affect any person whose salary is not paid directly from the public account, as, for example, officers of a semi-governmental institution such as the Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited. </para>

          <para>Officers who have been rationed in any financial year on or after 1st July, 1930, will not be subject to the tax during that financial year. Should there be cases in which the amount of rationing is not equal to the amount of tax it will rest with the administration to see that the same sacrifice is made by rationed officers as is made by others. Generally speaking, the rationing which has taken place so far is at least equal to the tax which it is proposed to levy. </para>
          <para>The basis of the tax is expressed in a separate taxing bill, which provides for the following taxes: - </para>
          <para>On allowances of senators and members - a tax of 10 per cent. of those allowances; </para>

          <para class="block">The tax will be deducted at the source from each payment of salary or allowance and will begin with the first payment of salary after the 1st December, 1930, but only in respect of salary earned after that date. </para>
          <para>It is possible that the salaries of some Commonwealth officials may fluctuate during the course of a year, and in order that the amount of the tax shall be definitely ascertainable in respect of each payment of salary in such cases, it has been found necessary to provide that the annual salary, for the purposes of the rate of tax to be applied to each payment, shall be calculated at the rate of the official's salary at the time of the payment. The salary of a taxpayer who is a Commonwealth official is defined to mean the annual remuneration paid to the official in respect of the office occupied by him, and any annual allowance paid in respect of any duties performed in addition to those of that office. </para>
          <para>Although, technically speaking, the salary or allowance of any person affected by the tax remains unaltered, the practical effect of the tax is to reduce that person's salary or allowance. In the circumstances, it is considered that the salary of any person, to the extent that it is subjected to a reduction by way of tax, should not form a part of his income for the purposes of ordinary income tax, or of any other form of taxation of salaries or allowance. </para>
          <para>The subject is a very controversial one. Members of Parliament have been criticized because of their alleged disinclination to tax themselves while being prepared to tax everybody else in the community. They are subjected to considerable criticism chiefly because the general public does not understand the peculiar circumstances which attach to the occupation of a member of Parliament, Parliamentary representatives are put to a great deal of expense which does not apply to those who follow other occupations, and their position is a very precarious one, giving no security of tenure. An honorable senator might remain in. office for his full term of six years, while a turn of the wheel of fortune might bring about a double dissolution and terminate his appointment within a month. However, members are a philosophical lot, and endeavour to accept without undue complaint anything that fate has in store for them. This measure imposes a pretty severe tax upon members of Parliament, and it is a definite indication that the Government is endeavouring, as far as possible, to spread the burden of taxation evenly over the community. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of members of the Government and the Senate representations which have been made to me from the South Australian Master Builders and Contractors Association in connexion with the duty on </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Oregon. The position is set out in the following extract from a letter which I have received from the secretary of that association, under date 1st December, 1930 : - </para>
        <para>We again approach you in reference to the duty on imported Oregon. The building trade in this State is at a standstill, and rents have fallen to such an extent that Lt will be impossible to stimulate trade whilst we are adding on extra charges. We have practically no bush mills in this State, and Oregon must be used for roofing, &amp;c. We do not know of any work where hardwood has replaced oregon, and given extra employment in the mills  . . No extra employment has been given to employees in bush mills in this State, but extra unemployment has been caused by this overloading, which means about £16 per house, which has to be carried for all time. </para>
        <para>The position is well known to most honorable senators. Oregon costs approximately 4s. per 100 super feet in the country of origin, and the present rate of duty is 12s. 6d. per 100 super feet, a duty of between 300 per cent. and 400 per cent. In 1927 the Tariff Board, with evident reluctance, recommended that the duty on Oregon be increased to 5s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, but the Government of the day increased it to 8s. I, and many other honorable senators, strongly protested against this action. That duty was operative until the 26th of July of this year, when the present Government increased it to 12s. 6d. per 100 super. feet. The tariff schedule which imposes this excessive duty has not yet been brought before Parliament. Strong representations have been made to the Government by honorable senators, and also by honorable members in another place, who have pointed out that a large number of timber firms have been seriously affected by the increased rate. Some time ago several' firms in South Australia sent their representatives to Canberra to place the position before the Government, but their representations were ignored.. By collecting this duty without the approval of Parliament, the Government is acting the part of a despot of the worst type. Its action also is a gratuitous insult to this chamber, which should be given an opportunity to discuss the numerous tariff schedules that have been laid on the table from time to time since the accession to office of this Government. I am firmly of the opinion that the Senate will not pass this particular duty. On the 10th June last, the quantity of oregon in stock or afloat was estimated at 63,000,000 super, feet. On this subject the Tariff Board reported - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">It was then 8s. per 100 super, feet - on undressed oregon in sizes 12 inches x S Inches or over would be neither justifiable nor desirable. </para>
        <para class="block">Yet, in the face of this recommendation, the Government, on the 26th July, tabled a schedule carrying an increased duty of 4s. 6d. I may add that the then ruling rate of 8s. was a compromise approved by the trade; but, as regards the last increase of 4s. 6d., the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> admitted that only one timber firm had made a request to the Government. Those firms which held large stocks of Oregon have benefited from the imposition of the increased duty; but other firms, with depleted stocks, are at a disadvantage. They are compelled to pay the. higher rate, and are, therefore, unable to compete on even terms with business rivals. It has been stated that the gain to firms with stocks on hand amounted to £150,000. It may interest honorable senators to know that the firm which approached the Government with a request for the increased duties had previously opposed any such action. We heard allegations of "logrolling " over the business, but the Leader of the Senate has stated that only one firm approached the Government. I have spoken to the representatives of several firms which had small stocks of oregon on hand when the new duty was imposed, and they have advised me that the additional duty which they are called upon to pay means that their price for </para>
        <para>Oregon loses them orders which otherwise they would be able to secure. Some of these firms are now threatened with ruin. If they are forced out of business, a considerable number of men will lose their employment. Now the builders, in their turn, are complaining bitterly about the added cost of building. We are told that for the average worker's home the increased cost, due to the duty, works out at about £16. Since the workers must eventually pay more for their homes, costs of production will be increased at a time when nearly every one agrees that, if Australia is to recover from the present depression, costs should come down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> drew attention to this matter some weeks ago. The honorable senator realized that, although Western Australia has practically an unlimited supply of hardwood, and presumably might benefit from the duty, it is impossible to use that class of timber for certain building construction. I strongly protest against the increased duty, and I urge the Government to take early action to remove, it. We are all liable to make mistakes. In this matter the best course for the Government will be to admit its mistake and rectify it at the earliest  possible date. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is wrong. Some of the firms which he has in mind may have had fair supplies  of Oregon  when the increased duty was imposed. The requests came chiefly from bush timber-millers and organizations  of  employees, who urged that the tariff  on oregon  should be increased so as to prevent it from competing with  local  timber for certain classes  of  work. The Government's aim, in increasing the duty, was to encourage the use of Australian timbers in all work for which it is suitable. </para>
