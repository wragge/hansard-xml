                    <para>The Imperial Conference of 1926 discussed whether the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should accept the optional clause; no decision was arrived at except that none of the British Governmentsshould accept the clause until there had been further consultation between them: In 1928, the Commonwealth Government decided that the matter should be further considered, and the Canadian Government proposed to the other governments of the British Commonwealth that further consideration should be given to the question, and some consultation took place. In August of last year the British Government advised that they considered they could accept the optional clause subject to certain reservations, and expressed the hope that all the British Governments might see their way to accept the clause, during the Tenth Assembly of the League, in a form of declaration which all approved. After long consultation, all the governments of the British Commonwealth except the Irish Free State decided to accept the clause on the same terms. The Irish Free State accepted the clause without any reservation. </para>
                    <para>The result of the acceptance of the optional clause is that the Commonwealth has undertaken to submit to the court for decision any legal dispute belonging to one of the four classes mentioned which is not excluded by the reservations. This means that should the Commonwealth become involved in such a dispute with another State which has also accepted the optional clause, that State can cite the Commonwealth before the Permanent Court. Of course, the Commonwealth can cite the other State in the same way. </para>
                    <para>The reservations agreed upon after long consultation between the various British Governments exclude four classes of disputes from the compulsory jurisdiction of the court - </para>

                    <para>In this case the court's jurisdiction is only suspended, and it can deal with the dispute when a certain period has elapsed since the submission to the Council. This reservation enables disputes partly political, partly legal, to be submitted in the first instance to what would probably be a more satisfactory mode of settlement than a purely judicial procedure. Finally, only disputes which arise after the declaration of acceptance has been ratified can be submitted to the court. A State cannot, therefore, cite the Commonwealth for a dispute concerning past facts or events. </para>
                    <para>Like all decisions, certain reasons could be urged against acceptance. The Commonwealth has agreed to submit certain cases, where the decision may have most important results, to a court which can give a majority decision from which there is no appeal. Moreover, international law is not a code of well-established, generally accepted rules like national law. The court, in the absence of international conventions, may, by article 38 of its statute, be guided by international custom, principles of law, judicial decisions, and teaching of highly qualified publicists. But whilst a State can make laws for its courts to enforce, there is as yet no machinery for enacting or amending such international rules. </para>
                    <para>But the reasons for accepting the clause in the opinion of the Commonwealth Government and all the other Governments of the British Commonwealth outweigh these disadvantages. On becoming members of the League of Nations we agreed to submit all disputes to some form of peaceful settlement. By the Treaty for the Renunciation of War we have undertaken to seek the solution of international disputes by peaceful means only. The necessity for providing ample means for the peaceful settlement of disputes is obvious and for disputes in which there is a conflict as to legal rights the decision of a judicial body, such as the Permanent Court, should be most satisfactory. We have accepted the optional clause for ten years and our experience during that period will, I trust, prove that the Permanent Court is fully able to discharge the powers we have decided to entrust to it. </para>

                    HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia) [3.27]. - I intend to ask the Senate to consider the bill not from the point of view of one who is hostile to all forms of bounties and high protection, but rather from the viewpoint of one who believes that, if we are to have a policy under which certain industries shall be assisted by other industries, that policy should be based on definite principles, which must be strictly observed. I should have thought that the present unfortunate position of the Commonwealth would warn the Ministry and honorable members of this Parliament of the danger of an indiscriminate policy of bolstering up certain industries at the expense of other industries. I feel sure that neither the Government nor the members of this Parliament nor the public generally, have paid anything like sufficient attention to the report of the Economic Committee appointed by the former Prime Minister. I offer no excuse for quoting two or three paragraphs from that report which have a particular bearing upon this measure. Let it be remembered that this is not merely a bounty bill. It is a tariff bill as well, because it is freely admitted that, without high protection for the manufacturing side of the cotton industry, the bounty would be wholly ineffective. It follows, therefore, that if we pass this bill, we shall pledge ourselves not only to the payment of a bounty, but also to a tariff. In paragraph 15 of its report the Economic Committee makes this statement: -

                <quote>
                    <para>From these various and contrary influences we conclude that the policy of protection has not had very great net effects upon the prosperity of the community as a whole. It has not brought all the benefits expected, nor has it been disastrous. But the benefits and costs of the tariff do not march together. </para>
                    <para>As the tariff grows, the costs overtake the benefits, because the benefits have natural limits, while the costs have not. Australian experience, like that of other countries, demonstrates the natural tendency of protection to increase. The most disquieting effect of the tariff has been the stimulus it has given to demands for government assistance of all kinds, with the consequent demoralizing  effect  upon self-reliant efficiency throughout all forms of production. </para>

                <para>We refrain from proposing a drastic weeding out of the worst cases, because, cancellation must involve the loss of capital invested and. specific employment. But there may be industries winch are costing more to maintain than would be lost by the withdrawal of protection.

The total burden of protection should not be increased. </para>

                    <para>They lie in the great natural advantages of certain industries, including gold and other metals in the past, but now almost confined to wool and some wheat. These great natural advantages are now all exploited, unless a. new mineral field of great richness should be discovered - and our available resources for subsidizing industry are at their maximum. These resources are now stretched as far as they will go in maintaining the standard of living for a growing population. 1 Any great additional strain, such as would be imposed by subsidizing wheat exports, must result in a fall in the standard or a check to population, which might easily go beyond the cessation of immigration and lead to emigration and a decline in the birth rate. It is only, in fact, by continued improvement in efficiency of production that our limited surplus resources can continue to subsidize uneconomic industry on even the present scale. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I point out that that was written twelve months ago, and that everything that has happened since has confirmed those- arguments. We have also reached the stage when, instead of an increased population by excess of arrivals over departures, we have witnessed recently an excess of departures over arrivals. That is the first step, and the next- step, if this policy is persisted in, will be a general lowering of the standard of living of the people. </para>
                <para>We recently discussed the granting of a wine bounty. I want to point out three very essential differences' between that bounty and the one that we are now considering. In the first place, the wine itself pays its. own bounty out of an excise. In this case the taxpayers have to pay the bounty. Should not that fact alone cause us to pause ? We are told that the deficits of the. Common wealth and State Governments for the current year are going to reach the huge total of £9,000,000 sterling.  The Commonwealth Treasurer has told the Treasurer of the States- that it is essential that they should endeavour to balance their budgets as the first step towards re-establishing Australia's . credit. The honorable gentleman said that he intended, to make that endeavour himself in regard to the finances of the Commonwealth. That will necessitate rigorous action, and increased and extreme taxation. We are told that that will occur not only this year, but next year and the year after that. Can we with a light heart face additional burdens? Here we are asked .to commit the country to further expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue to bonus an industry whose merits have not, I submit, been sufficiently investigated by the Government. Obviously, as the Economic Committee pointed out, this bonus will have to come out of the other industries of the country. It can come from no other source. Can those industries afford it? </para>
                <para>The second point of difference between this and the wine bounty is that wine is a luxury and people can please themselves whether they contribute towards, the bonus. I make bold to say that it will be found that a great many will refrain from drinking wine and so contributing to the bonus. Here we are dealing with a necessity to which everybody will be compelled to contribute twice over, first as taxpayers to meet the direct bounty, and then as users of the commodity, through the indirect channel of increased customs duties. The poorer sections of' the community will have to contribute most, through the increased cost of their clothing. There you have a direct attack on the standard of living of those who can least afford to have that, standard lowered. I do not think that there is .the slightest question that already the standard of living is lowered among a large section of the community by the present policy of ill-considered  bonusing  of industries. I quote only two instances, sugar and butter. I remind supporters of the Government that only recently the Melbourne Trades Hall raised a protest against the high price of butter, in respect of which there is a form of bonus not very dissimilar from this. I believe that a great many people would be shocked if they were fully awakened to the fact that the present bonus paid to the Australian sugar industry, by the increased cost imposed upon the consumers of sugar in this country, is more than £200 per annum for every person employed in that industry. If that fact were generally known people would begin to wonder whether we can go on indefinitely mak.ing the natural industries of the country support these industries for which the country apparently is not suited. We cannot 'expect to be suited to every kind of industry. </para>
                <para>The third point. of difference between this and the wine bounty is that  wine-growing  and wine-making is beyond all question an industry entirely suited to Australia. Although I do not like the manner in which the assistance is granted, I would say' by all means help an industry for which the country is suited, and which can be made to progress. Can it be claimed that cotton is unquestionably an industry for which Australia is suited? At page 112 of its report, the Economic Committee lays down an obviously sound principle that I do not think was followed in this instance, that preference should be given to industries with the least comparative disadvantages, either present or prospective. It is a sound principle that we should endeavour to build up in  Austra- </para>
                <para>Iia those industries which have the least, comparative disadvantage with those of other countries, and not to bother about those, with the greatest comparative disadvantage. It seems to . me that the amount of protection which is alleged to be necessary in regard to our cotton industry proves beyond all question that it is an industry in which that comparative disadvantage is very great indeed. It is one of the last industries that we should ask the natural industries of this country to support. </para>
                <para> Let. us consider the recent history of this industry, its present position, and its future prospects. In 1920 the Queensland Government provided a bonus, as-, a result of which it lost £78,929. Two years later that Government, whose Premier is now the Commonwealth Treasurer, was astute enough to persuade the Commonwealth Government to join in the guarantee. Undeterred by the unfortunate experience of the State, the Commonwealth became a co-partner in guaranteeing the industry. In three seasons the two authorities lost £359,790.. In relation to the next stage let me quote the words of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In view of the increasing losses and other difficulties associated with the industry, the Queensland Government in 1925 urged the Commonwealth to take over the whole matter. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">One would have thought that if the losses-' were increasing and the difficulties becoming greater, the Commonwealth Government would have said that if theState Government had faith in the industry it should be prepared to carry the burden, seeing that it would benefit if the industry was successful. But it did not do so. On the contrary, it' took over the whole responsibility, because "of the increasing losses and other difficulties associated with the industry." In my opinion the personal equation had a lot to do with that decision. The then Premier of Queensland was a man of vigour who knew definitely what he wanted; the Treasurer of the Commonwealth was a man who wanted to be a. little ray of sunshine and to make everybody happy - a man obsessed with the idea that the resources at his hand were unlimited and that he could grant assistance to all who asked for it. The fact; remains that the Commonwealth, took over the guarantee, and in four successive seasons paid out another £320,000. What was the result ? The production of cotton fell from 18,282,643 "lb. in 1924-1925 to less than' 8,000,000 lb. 'of cotton in 1928- 1929. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> sought to explain that falling-off by saying that- </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">With all respect to the worthy Leader of the Senate, I can scarcely refrain from characterizing a statement ' of that kind as  nonsense.  Has any industry in this country ever had stability of- prices or labour .conditions? Does not every successful industry in any part of the world prosper by reason of the necessity  for competitive effort and for meeting changing conditions as they arise? Nothing would be more certain to ruin any industry than stability of conditions, for it would destroy all initiative and effort, with the result that very soon the last state of that industry would be worse than the first. During the period that governments dissipated £750,000 of public money, -and' there was a steady decline in the production of cotton, how did private investors fare? In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last week there appeared a statement in regard to the BritishAustralian Cotton Association Limited, which indicated that the association intended to sell its assets to Australian Cotton Co-operative Association Limited, a new growers' concern. As a step preliminary to the sale the old company is asking its- preference shareholders to forgo the whole of the dividends, to which they are entitled in order that some small liquidation dividend may be paid to the ordinary shareholders. So far the preference shareholders have not received any dividend - nor indeed have the ordinary shareholders - although they put £370,000 into the project. The statement goes on to say - </para>

The directors, who have been in the business for some years, do not take so sanguine a view of the position as the Commonwealth Government does. Indeed, their outlook is so gloomy that they tell their shareholders that if they get £137,500 for assets which in December last were valued at nearly £500,000 they will be lucky. </para>

Could any one imagine anything more stupid than the statement that if the cotton growers can be assured of prices that will give them a reasonable return they can develop their industry? Under conditions like that one could grow mango-steens at the North Pole or make ice in Hades.

                    <para>It is apparent that the requirements of the Commonwealth in the class of cotton now grown in Australia will very easily be reached by the growers and the question will then arise as to the direction in which extension should be guided. In sounding the foregoing note of warning the board merely seeks to prevent the cotton industry reaching the stage of over-production reached by certain other Australian primary industries in which production has got far beyond the requirements of Australia, thus necessitating export. The result has proved to be disastrous in the case of those products where Australia is unable and cannot hope to compete on overseas markets with the products of other countries. </para>

                <para class="block">I draw attention to the words " all cotton bounties will cease", and the words " adequate tariff protection ". Surely it is stating the obvious. What practical difference is there between a bounty and a tariff? What is the use of saying that we can do away with this bounty if we push the tariff higher up and thus give a bounty indirectly instead of directly? The effect is exactly the same both on the industry and on the people who will have to pay. To tell us that at the end of 1936 all bounties will disappear so long as adequate tariff protection is afforded, is to indicate that the bounty will be continuous; that it will never disappear; that if the direct bounty is stopped the indirect bounty in the shape of tariff protection will have to be increased. </para>

                        <para>-I shall come to that . directly. We were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> in his speech that in spite of all that has happened, the Government is greatly impressed with the prospects of the cotton industry. Apparently this impression was created at a conference between Commonwealth Ministers and Queensland Ministers. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was at that conference. I know that he is animated by the desire to do the best for his country. But the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> who was also at the conference, is the man who in the first instance was responsible for the giving of a bounty on cotton in Queensland, and succeeded in inducing the Commonwealth Government first to go fifty-fifty with the State Government in the' payment of the bounty, and then to take over the whole of the burden. He was hopelessly committed by his past actions to the continuance of this scheme. The other Commonwealth Minister at the conference was the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> He is a Queenslander whose constituents will benefit by this proposal if any one does, and who frankly believes that any industry can be established in Australia as long as it is afforded a sufficiently high tariff protection or given a sufficiently high bounty. I ask if that was an impartial tribunal to which a person would refer such a matter if he intended putting his own money in it? Should we not be just as careful when the people's money is at stake? It appears to me that the Commonwealth Government might well have said to the representatives of the Queensland Government who took part in the conference: "If this is going to be such a good thing, and if yourState is going to benefit by it, you ought to stand in with us and take your share ". </para>

                        <para>asked what I should say if a bounty were paid on gold. At the present time, Australia is imposing a burden of £6 per head of the population and distributing it in subsidies . on protected industries. The figures have altered slightly during the last twelve months to the advantage of the larger States, but a year ago this £6 was distributed among the States in the following proportions :  - Queensland, £8 ; Victoria. £7 ; New South Wales, £5 10s.; Tasmania, £4; South Australia, £3 14s.; and Western Australia, £3 12s. </para>

At present the State is£2 8s. per head short of its proportion on the distribution of the £6 per head of the population of -Australia, and gets something less than £1 per head in the shape of a special subsidy.

                            <para>- I have no desire to be led off the track, but if ever there was anything that hurt Western Australia and the other States it was that wretched roads grant. If the Commonwealth gave a bonus of £1 an ounce on the 400,000 oz. of gold produced annually in Western Australia, and 6d. per bushel on the 40,000,000 bushels of wheat produced in that State, it would total £1,400,000, which, distributed on the present population of the State, would amount to £3 7s. per head. Added to the present subsidy, it would amount to £6 19s., still £1 ls. less than Queensland gets, and ls. less than Victoria gets. Tasmania and South Australia are in the same boat as Western Australia in this respect. Not only have the people of Western Australia paid so much more than the people of other States, but as yet there are no bounties payable on wheat or gold. It is all very well to ask what we should say if we got them. We have not got them, and, so far as the gold bounty is concerned, notwithstanding the resolution of the Canberra conference of the Labour party, we are told that the Commonwealth Government is opposed to it. </para>

                        COLEBATCH.Quite so. During the last five years the average value of our exports to Japan has been £11,500,000 per annum, whereas Japan has sold to us less than £4,500,000 worth per annum. In our trade with that country we have had the advantage of over £7,000,000 per annum. Why then should we be concerned if we. buy a little more from Japan so long as we get it cheaply? What advantage is there in imposing a burden upon all the other industries of a country in order that we may buy dear cotton from Queensland instead of cheap cotton from people who are among our best customers? We cannot continue, selling goods to Japan or the rest of the world, unless we are prepared to buy from other countries.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper's</inline>
                        remark exposed the fallacy of the idea that we can, by means of big tariff barriers or bounties, compete with countries specially adapted for producing goods for which Australia is not adapted. Japan buys from us twice as much as she sells to us, and we should not be afraid to buy a little more from her, particularly goods she can produce much more cheaply than we can.
                    </para>
                    <para>I should now like to refer to the- industrial aspect of this proposal. In the first place, I maintain that the payment of this bounty is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Constitution, and that it is entirely wrong for a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to be brought into a matter of this kind. Constitutional power in industrial matters can be exercised only when an industrial dispute extends beyond the limits of any one State. Although the cotton industry is confined to one State, the bill provides that a judge of the- Arbitration Court shall have power to determine the wage's and conditions of those engaged in the industry. Under this measure the court is to obtrude in an industrial field which the Constitution definitely provides shall be reserved to the States. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins laid down the dictum that if an industry could not pay a fair wage and provide reasonable working conditions it should go out of existence. Those who think that that may be a rather dangerous doctrine have to admit that its effect would be to compel us to concentrate upon those industries best able to pay reasonable wages, and from that viewpoint it may be justified. Now we have a new theory that an industry which cannot, in the ordinary  sense, pay fair wages and provide reasonable working conditions, must be supported by other industries. That embodies a principle which is far worse than that enunciated by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and is so utterly destructive in principle that it would inevitably  bring down the standard of living in Australia. It can have no other effect, because its clear meaning is that every worker in a profitable industry must contribute towards the maintenance of  those engaged in unprofitable indus. tries. It is utterly wrong and entirely indefensible in principle that a highly protected industry should . give its employees wages and conditions of . labour that cannot be enjoyed by those in other industries which have to compete with the markets of .the world. It is entirely unfair, and I defy any advocate of such a policy to defend it upon any reasonable basis. </para>
                    <para>Reference was made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Geoffrey</inline> Evans, the cotton expert, who was brought to Australia by the Queensland Government. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans,</inline> who knew his business from beginning to end, came to Australia he was director of agriculture in the province of Bengal, and after he left Australia was immediately snapped up, and to-day is 'Principal of the Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad. At the time the Queensland Government, induced the Commonwealth Government to take over the whole pf  the burden, the Queensland Government had ignored the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> and allowed the industry to proceed along lines which he entirely condemned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans's</inline> view was that the only phase of cotton-growing in Australia likely to be commercially successful was that conducted by families. If a number of families living close to each other engage in growing cotton, and the picking is done by the children,* how are these industrial conditions going to be regarded? Is the Arbitration Court to determine that these families are not. to receive the bounty because the work is not done by outside labour at wages fixed by the Arbitration Court? Are we to compel such persons to pay bogus wages to their children in order to receive the bounty or are we to deny them the right to receive the bounty and thereby drive out of the industry those most likely to succeed in iti </para>
                    <para>This .proposal embodies a part of the Government's effort to keep up the price level in Australia irrespective of what is happening in other countries. I remind honorable senators of the trend of prices in Great Britain during the last two or three years. Taking 100 as a basis iri 1927 we find that by  December.  1928, the British wholesale prices had fallen to 95, by December, 1929, to 88.33, and by May, 1930, to 80.6, or a drop of nearly 20 per cent, in three years. During a period of three years, again taking 100 as a basis, cereals and meats fell to 82, other food products to 79, textiles to 71, minerals to 84.3, and miscellaneous to 84.4. Again we have evidence of the fact that we are doing exactly what economists say we must not do. We are bolstering up an industry that has a maximum disadvantage in comparison with that in many other countries. The most pronounced drop is in connexion with textiles, which decreased to 71. No attempt has been made to disguise the fact that a cotton bounty will be utterly futile unless supplemented by high customs duties, thus enabling the manufacturer to pay an excessive price for his raw material. Can there be any other result but an increase in cost to the consumer, which in this case means the entire community? Because I am satisfied that that must be the result, and that it must mean an increase in the cost of production, and that nothing can save Australia except a decrease  in the cost of production, I intend to vote against the second reading of the bill. </para>

                            <para>- If the majority of honorable senators held similar opinions our protective policy would soon have to be abandoned, and before very long, the workers of Australia, if they did not fall to the level of the coolies of Java and India, would at least have to submit to a standard of living similar to that of the poor whites of South Africa. We must give grave consideration to any proposal which will assist in maintaining' our present standard of living. I am sorry that in discussing this subject <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> had so much to say concerning the State of Queensland. I do not propose to discuss this proposal from the viewpoint of Queensland, but shall endeavour to do so from the standpoint of a good Australian. We are not dealing with a country small in area, such as Great Britain or New Zealand, but with a continent in which we have every class of soil, and a full range of climate, so that we are able to produce the whole of our requirements. We have vast areas where tropical and sub-tropical conditions obtain, and if we do not encourage production suitable to such areas we shall not be able to claim that they are being effectively settled and developed. In Queensland we have a population of approximately 1,000,000 persons; but in parallel latitudes in Central and Western Australia, the total white population is less than 5,000 persons. </para>

The amount which the people of the other States pay for sugar produced in Queensland is more than compensated for by what the people of Queensland purchase from the other States. The conditions of Western Australia are of course peculiar and deserve special consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said that they are. But why speak of that part of the Commonwealth as Queensland ? Why not treat it in our discussions and in our legislation as an integral part of the Commonwealth which it is necessary to develop if we are to hold this great country for the white race ? After reading the report of the British Economic Mission I concluded that its members studied every subject from the standpoint of Great Britain. They did not look at anything from the Australian standpoint, and throughout their report did not get beyond generalities. In effect, they advocated that we should import from Great Britain everything which we could purchase there for less than we could produce it in Australia. </para>

Is it not a fact that, in 1914, many economists predicted that the war would not last more than six months, because the countries engaged would be unable to finance it? Is it not a fact also that, late in 1918,  arrangements had been made, by the Allies at least, to finance the war for another two years if necessary? </para>

                    <para>It is true that the cotton industry has not proved so successful as was anticipated when the existing legislation was passed. But I have every confidence that if it receives the same consideration that is given to other industries requiring protection, eventually it will become a source of considerable wealth, which will be shared by all the people of Australia. Unlike New South Wales and Victoria, Queensland has not established a large number of secondary industries, so every ship which carries Queensland cotton to the southern States' for manufacturing purposes will, on the return journey, carry to Queensland from the other States products which, compared with overseas prices, will be quite as costly as anything which the other States purchase from Queensland. </para>

                        stated that conditions in the Commonwealth were not suited for the production of cotton. I entirely disagree with the honorable senator. The natural conditions of Queensland will permit of the growth of cotton equal in quality to that produced in any other country, the only difference being in the wages paid to workers engaged in the industry. This, however, is not likely to be such a handicap in the future as it has been hitherto, because of the increasing use made of mechanical appliances for the ginning of cotton. It is not now necessary to exercise the same care in separating the cotton from the boll, or from parts of the cotton bush. I understand that, in the United States of America, the practice now is to gather the boll by the process known as " snapping and up-to-date machinery turns out lint quite as clean as when the cotton was picked carefully out of the boll.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline>
                        stated also that the Queensland Government was not prepared to accept any financial obligation in connexion with the industry. I presume he was not aware that the Queensland Government is guaranteeing repayment to the Commonwealth Bank of £150,000, the amount required to purchase the ginneries of the Australian Cotton Association. This includes £137,000 for the association's ginneries or mills, and a sufficient sum for the purchase of new machinery, which is now on its way from America. When this machinery is installed it is anticipated that the cost of picking will be reduced, and since the amount of capital involved will be less, the cost of ginning will not' be so great as hitherto. It is expected also that better prices will rule in future for the cotton seed. In view of all the circumstances it seems to me that very little objection can be taken to the passing of this bill.

                    <para> As for the encouragement given to the industry by the imposition of customs duties, all I need say is that it will be on lines similar to protection given to practically every other Australian industry. We have very few industries that are not receiving assistance either in the form of customs duties or the payment of bounties. Certain classes of cotton goods are being manufactured in Australia. Two years ago I visited two factories in Melbourne. Both concerns were being carried on successfully. One factory was manufacturing weekly 2,000 dozen towels for which there was a ready sale in every State of the Commonwealth. It is true that all the yarn for the manufacture of those towels was being imported, but the manager told me that there was no reason why the cotton should not be grown and the yarn manufactured in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, but I know of no variety of cotton which cannot be grown in Queensland, although I admit it would not be possible to produce every variety immediately. When the industry was established in that State it was believed  that a particular variety waa the most profitable to produce and as world's prices were then at a high level the cotton was grown with a view to export as well as for sale within Australia. Although all the necessary varieties may be grown in Queensland there is provision in the Tariff Act to permit of the importation of those kinds that are not grown, if they are considered requisite for the manufacture of cotton goods. It is possible also that the weaving of cotton goods in Australia will progress more rapidly than the spinning of cotton yarn. In this event there would be no objection to the importation of the* necessary yarn, so that no branch of the manufacturing industry need be handicapped. </para>

                    <para>In dealing with this bill we should give careful consideration to the economic position of Australia. Last year our imports were valued at over £160,000,000. If the value of our exports amounts to, say, £120,000,000, and if we cannot balance our trade figures by borrowing overseas, how are we going to bridge the gap in' our finances? Obviously the only course is to produce locally more of our own requirements, and in this way provide for the employment of more of our own people. I admit that difficulties confront us, but we have surmounted them on previous occasions, and I have no doubt that we shall' do so again. Many industries which to-day give employment to a large number of our people, in their earlier stages had to overcome serious obstacles to progress. I am aware that many people believe that an increase in the value of our exports is the only way to balance our overseas trade and improve our present position. I suggest, however, that if our purchases overseas are reduced by £1,000,000 the net effect upon the finances of the Commonwealth will be exactly the same as if we increased the value of our export trade by £1,000,000. It is difficult to see how, in the present state of our trade, we can materially increase exports for some time to come. We know the position of the wool industry. It . appears to me that the more wool we produce the lower will be the price that we shall receive for it, as the world's production of wool has in- creased very rapidly during recent years. There is also a limit to the quantity of wheat that we can export. Nobody can foretell the possibilities of the world's wool and wheat markets, but  we  are on perfectly safe ground in endeavouring to increase the production of those commodities that we need foi* our own consumption.. The position would be very different if we were living in a freetrade world; but we are not. So far as I am aware, there is not a freetrade country in the world to-day. </para>

                            <para>- Great Britain believes in freetrade for the commodities that it cannot produce, and a similar position exists in a number of other countries. We can produce cotton in Australia, and I believe that it will be very much to our interest to establish the industry in this country. It is true that Great Britain does not impose a duty upon our wool or wheat, but the British buyer of. those products does not give one farthing more for a pound of wool or for a bushel of wheat because it comes from Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is very true. We know that .quite recently, in countries older than Australia, with larger populations, and industries in a more advanced condition than ours, it has been considered advisable to increase duties. That was done by the United States of America, with its population of over 120,000,000, and by our sister dominion, Canada. Probably it will not be possible, for a long time, to develop  the cotton industry sufficiently to manufacture all classes of cotton fabric. I think that there are more kinds of fabric made from cotton than from any other kind of material. There are, however, certain ' ' classes of cotton goods that can' -be produced in a large way in. a very short time in Australia, if sufficient protection is "given to the industry.  I have already referred to the extent to which towels are manufactured here. I also understand that if we concentrate on the manufacture of all the different types of duck we shall need for the purpose two to three times the quantity of raw cotton that we are now producing. Australia is already manufacturing a considerable quantity of cotton tweeds. I .remember that when the last tariff schedule was brought down, increasing the duty on imported cotton tweeds, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> prophesied that garments made from that material would be prohibitive in price, because of that duty. I doubt whether cotton tweeds have ever been procurable at a lower price than they are to-day. </para>

A similar remark applies to all of the items to which increased protection was given under the amended tariff schedules submitted by the Bruce-Page Government. It rarely follows that increased protection means an increase in the price of the goods affected. Our experience is that articles manufactured from cotton have decreased in price since the. last tariff schedule was approved by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- It is now possible to buy cotton tweed trousers for 2s. 6d. a pair. Anybody who considers that that price is too high is difficult to satisfy. That result is the very opposite from that prophesied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> The passing of this bill and the imposition of additional duties on imported cotton products will result in the employment of a great many more Australians, not only in that part of the Commonwealth where cotton is grown, but in those parts where it is spun into yarn and woven into fabrics. I can see no hope of improving the unfortunate economic position in which we now find ourselves, unless we are able to provide a variety of employment for our people. We must realize that it is impossible to find employment on the land for a greater percentage of our population than that at present engaged in rural industries. In all other countries having conditions comparable with ours, there has been a decline in the percentage of people engaged in land pursuits,' although the volume of production has increased. That is due chiefly to the mechanization of the. agricultural industry, enabling one man to-day to do the work that required a number of men in comparatively recent years. I was brought up on a mixed farm, and I remember that in my early days most of the ploughing was done with single furrow ploughs. That was long before the days -of tractors or even of disc ploughs. When harvesting it was necessary to employ ten men to bind, and two men to put the sheaves into stooks. It was considered a good day's work to harvest ten acres. Stacking and threshing were additional tasks. To-day, we have machines that enable three men to harvest completely from 40 to 50 acres a day. </para>

                    <para>A couple of years ago a very interesting report was issued by the Economic Committee that met at Geneva. It stated that while the population of the world had increased by only 5 per cent, since the termination, of the war,, the production of food-stuffs and of raw material from the land had increased by . 18 per. cent. While we may not have a surplus of certain commodities that the. world requires to-day, we certainly have more than the world is in a position to purchase. </para>

In view of all these circumstances it becomes imperative to produce those commodities that we can consume so that we may reduce the quantity of goods that we purchase from abroad. I am satisfied that if honorable senators will rid themselves of the idea that the purpose of the bill is merely to provide a special concession for Queensland, and, instead, will realize that it is a proposal to encourage and assist to develop an Australian industry that will benefit the whole community, it will be passed by a unanimous vote. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not have felt disposed to" speak upon this measure had it not 'been for the challenge thrown out to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford.</inline> I shall not indulge in any  heroics, as did the honorable senator in his opening remarks. I shall deal with this matter as it affects Australia. For many years I have interested myself in the possibility of growing cotton successfully in Australia. Time after time I have visited Queensland to investigate the industry personally. I have done so because I looked forward to the time when we would grow cotton on such a commercial basis that, with the aid of our Lancashire friends, we should be able to manufacture in Australia all our requirements in the way of cotton textiles. I have been keen on seeing the cotton-growing industry established in Australia, provided it could be established on sound lines. The greatest danger confronting the industry is contained in this bill, in which it is laid down that the bounty will not be paid unless certain conditions with regard to labour are observed by those engaged in the growing of cotton. I say unhesitatingly that, if the ordinary conditions of labour are to apply to the growing of cotton, the cotton-growing industry in Australia is foredoomed to failure. Five or six years ago. when there was a revival in the industry, I wrote to the head of the British- Australian Cotton Growing Association. He stated that the industry could develop as a sound commercial proposition only if the growing of cotton was undertaken on a family basis as an adjunct to other forms of farming, and managed exclusively by the family. ' He was insistent that, if the labour conditions operating in industry generally were to apply to the cotton-growing industry, that industry must inevitably fail. Yet the bill provides for those conditions. I agree with those who say that we can grow anything, or manufacture anything, in Australia. But the point is whether we can do so within the reach of the purchasing power of our people. The bounty proposed in this bill on cotton seed and cotton yarn of the count in ordinary use, namely 16, amounts to nearly lOd. a lb., whereas the landed cost of yarn imported from America, on which the highest duty is paid, is only ls. 7£d. a lb. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I am not opposed to the establishment of the cotton industry in Australia ; but I do want to see it established on sound lines. I know of no other industry which we have attempted to assist by way of a bounty to the extent provided in this bill. There was a good deal of sound common-sense in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that it would be unreasonable for Australians to expect to manufacture or produce everything they required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> said that Australia should be self-contained in these matters. The term " self-contained " is frequently used by people who give little thought to its meaning. I do not suggest that the honorable senator so used it. But to be self-contained, Australia would have, not only to manufacture all the goods her people require, but would also have to be able to consume her total primary production. If we have to depend upon the outside world to take 75 per cent, of our primary production, as is the case to-day, how can we be self-contained  ? Although desirous of seeing industries established in Australia, I feel that it would be unwise to say that, because we can establish an industry here, we must do so regardless of cost. That brings me to a matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> to which I had not intended to allude. The honorable senator referred to the attitude I adopted some time ago when, in connexion with a tariff schedule, the item " cotton tweed " was under discussion. That tariff schedule imposed an enormously high duty on a material which is used in the manufacture of clothing which is worn only by the working men of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- In a matter with which I am thoroughly conversant, I take second place to no one. At the time of which I speak, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> was Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, and he exhibited samples of cotton tweed which he said were produced in four Australian mills.. I visited one of these mills, in which I was financially interested, and obtained samples of their cotton tweeds. The proprietors of those mills told the Tariff Board that they were prepared to manufacture the whole of Australia's cotton-tweed requirements, amounting to 4,500,000 yards per annum. The price charged by them for that material was from 2s.  3d. to 2s. 6d. a yard, although an exactly similar product could be landed here at from ls. 4d., to ls. 6d. a yard, duty paid. Thus they would be able to capture the market for the cotton tweed because of the tariff protection afforded the industry, namely ls. a yard plus 35 per cent. This enabled them to sell their product at a slightly lower price than that at which the imported material could be sold. The information supplied by them to the Tariff Board gave me a basis of calculation on which I submitted some figures to the Senate later. At the time I challenged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> to disprove the accuracy of my figures, but he did not attempt to do so. I shall again give those figures, and I challenge any honorable senator to prove that they are incorrect. The 4,500,000 yards of cotton tweed, to which I have referred, if made into trousers, would produce 1,80'0,000 pairs. The mill price for the tweed is 2s. 6d. a yard, as against ls. 6d. for imported British cotton tweed before the heavy duty was imposed. That means an addition of 3s. 9d. to the 'cost of every pair of trousers sold to the working men of Australia provided they supply the whole of the tweed required at the prices quoted. I ascertained from a British manufacturer that 108 girls would be required to tend the looms necessary to produce that quantity of tweed in a British factory. Allowing for the inexperience of Australian girls, I based my calculation on double that number, and assessed their wage at £2 10s. a week. On that basis, the wages bill for the 216 girls so employed would be £28,000 a year. I then allowed another £28,000 for the wages of the pressers,  folders, packers, distributors and others. In round figures, the total wages payable, according to my estimate, amounted to £60,000. I pointed out that the new prohibitive duty would necessitate the working men of Australia paying £337,000 more for their working trousers than they paid the year before. </para>

Are we justified in granting a bounty to protect an industry whose wages bill amounts to £60,000 per annum if by so doing the working men of this country are mulcted in the payment of an additional £337,000? </para>

                            <para>- They have. I took the trouble to verify my figures the next year. I went to 20 or 30 of the leading retail establishments in Australia that deal with working men. I found that for trousers which in previous years sold at 8s. 9d. a pair, they were asking 12s. 9d. - 4s. more than they paid previously. My estimate was 3s. 9d. Honorable senators will therefore see that the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> that cotton-tweed trousers can be obtained in Australia for 2s. 6d. is incorrect. My calculations were in respect of standard cotton tweed, such as was being manufactured by the Australian mills when they presented their case to the Tariff Board. In Melbourne the other day, an establishment offered for sale, at 6d. a pair, 300 pairs of women's hosiery, the mill price of which was 27s. 6d. a dozen. That is to continue' for a week. Would I be justified in saying that there we have an instance of the beneficial effect of the tariff? Certainly not. The firm does that solely as an advertisement. It is prepared to lose £30 a day as an- advertisement in order to draw people to its establishment where they will buy other goods which will be sold at a high profit. </para>

                            <para>- I rose to deal with this matter on its merits, as I try to do with every measure. I can well understand an honorable senator criticizing earnestly and faithfully a proposal for the payment of a bounty in one direction, while supporting the payment of a bounty in another direction. If the present proposal had as its basis the utilization of something which we are producing in Australia and is now going to waste, but which by the granting of a bounty can be made a great asset to the country, it would be quite a different matter from a proposal to bring into being an asset that hitherto has not been in existence here. </para>

Cotton is not grown to-day on lands not suitable for other production in the Dawson Valley or in the neighbourhood of Rockhampton. </para>

                            <para>- I am not opposed to encouragement being given to the cotton-growing industry. My objection to the present bill is that it lays down certain artificial conditions which, I think, will imperil the success of the industry. I refer to the introduction of ordinary industrial conditions into the small cotton-fields of Queensland. I should have liked to see a provision in the measure limiting the payment of the bounty in such a way that it would compel cotton-growing to be a small man's task. If that were done, another 5,000 people could be put on the land in Queensland. </para>

                    <para>I want to see the cotton industry encouraged on sound and reasonable lines. But the fact that in addition to the bounty, which in itself is more than 50 per cent, on the cost of the finished article that can be imported from foreign countries, there is a proposal in another bill to increase the duty on cotton yarn from 20 per cent, intermediate and 35 per cent, general to 35 per cent, 'intermediate and 55 per cent, general, makes one wonder how far Parliament is prepared to go in . the matter. My anxiety is to enable the people of Australia to feed, clothe, and house themselves at a reasonable cost. There is no doubt we shall have to discard some of the ideas that have permeated us. During the last ten years we have had the idea that we can maintain a high standard by artificial means. Australia, because of its recuperative powers and wonderful natural resources, has been able to do so better than any other country in the world, but the position is different to-day. We are now faced with adversity, and, as individuals and as a community, we have to meet it by making sacrifices. We must do without many of the things to which we have been accustomed, but which are not really essential to our well-being. It is only by a policy of that kind that we can hope to get through this period of adversity with anything like reasonable success. </para>

                    <para>Minister himself. With great candour and a good deal of detail he has given the history of the endeavours to produce cotton in Australia. The efforts in this respect date back sixty or seventy years. They culminated in the assistance ultimately offered by the Queensland Government which subsequently cajoled the Commonwealth Government into coming to its aid and becoming a party to the arrangement for the payment of a bounty. It appears that already £767,000 of the taxpayers' money has been ladled out to this industry, and no share of the amount has been contributed by the industry itself. To me it seems to be hopeless to salve the wreck under Australian conditions. </para>
                    <para>I listened with interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> because I was endeavouring to keep an open mind on the question. I realize that any industry capable of development in Australia should be stimulated; but I have been driven by dint of hard reasoning to the view that cotton-growing is not one of those industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> and most honorable senators who have spoken in support of the bill have invited us to regard it as a coming industry, but nothing concrete has been placed before us to indicate that it is ever likely to succeed in Australia. We know that it has failed in the past and, I understand, under most advantageous conditions. No one has pointed out what future advantage is to be derived by the establishment of the cotton industry here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> it is true, has referred to the expectation of improvements in picking and ginning methods. These expectations are not new. Years ago I was approached with a view to my taking an interest in a company to be formed for the purpose of doing something in connexion with cotton, and like others, had to listen to the story told of new methods that were to be adopted to reduce expenses. Everything in the garden was to be lovely. My friend, however, says that he prefers to rely on the views of practical economists, and it is . as a practical economist that I invite honorable senators to consider the question before us to-day. At this time of strenuous financial difficulty is it wise for us to say to the world that we propose to commit ourselves to the expenditure of £800,000 to buttress an industry that has already had £767,000 of the taxpayers' money lavished upon it, besides additional assistance in the way of a guarantee on overdrafts by the State Government of Queensland? It has had every assistance, yet it is impossible for it to carry on without further help for another six and a half years. </para>
                    <para>However earnest the Minister may be in his desire to terminate the payment of the bounty at the end of six and a half years, I am afraid that once we agree to pay it for that period we shall have to continue to pay it for a further period, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> has pointed out, impose a prohibitive customs duty. No figures have been placed before us to indicate the stimulus to employment that has been afforded by the payment of a bounty on cotton production. It is important that we should have this information, yet it has not been supplied. What will the payment of this bounty do to relieve the present unemployment? </para>

                    <para>SenatorMcLACHLAN. - I voted for a bounty on the export of wine because there was a moral responsibility on the Government as there would be on any other government to pay such a bounty. The wine bounty, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> differs from a cotton bounty. The wine industry bears the full burden of the bounty it receives, whereas the cotton industry never can and never will bear even a share of the burden of a bounty it receives. Nothing is more needed in this country than the production of produce for export. No bounty is paid on wine unless it is exported. </para>
                    <para class="block">I defy any one to say that we shall ever be able to produce cotton in Australia for export. I have no desire to raise the question of freetrade versus protection in this matter although I think we might describe what is now proposed as "fool trade" instead of freetrade. I have always been a protectionist, but there is a limit to what can be done in the way of protection. We have already reached that limit in Australia. We have had our lesson in regard to cotton, and if we refuse to profit by it the blame must rest on those who support the Government in propounding a continuation of one of the most foolish policies that has ever been embarked upon in Australia. Cotton growing is not a native industry. It has had tremendous buttressing with government money. It has failed irretrievably, and will fail again. What advantage have we derived from it? What employment will be provided by it, although it is buttressed by enormous duties amounting to 55 per cent, and by a bounty which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has pointed out, amounts to 10¼d.  on an article which can be imported for ls.7£d. ? </para>

                            <para>- I have never known the payment of a bounty to cease at the expiration of the period originally intended. If honorable senators will refer to the records they will find that, when a cotton bounty was first provided, Parliament was told that it would be paid only for a certain period; but its payment has been continued. The original act provides for the payment of a bounty until August, 1931. The Government, having supported the principle of the payment of bounties, which, in this instance, is uneconomic and unsound, finds it difficult to recede. A case has not been made out in support of the proposals in the bill, and I believe the industry will ultimately be faced with great difficulties.. The facts disclosed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> destroy any arguments advanced in favour of the payment of a bounty. If the cotton industry were native to this country, such as the pastoral, agricultural, fruit-growing and other industries are, there would be some justification in assisting it, particularly if it could serve some useful purpose such as helping to adjust our trade balance, or providing employment. Most industries experience periods of prosperity and depression, but during recent years, when prices were high, the cotton industry should have become firmly established and shown the people of Australia that it is worthy of assistance. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that production of cotton in Australia will ever be a commercial success. The Minister said it was the policy of the Government to give unceasing consideration to the withdrawal of bounties ; but if the Minister had applied himself more closely to the real position he would know why the industry has not developed to the extent anticipated. He would have ascertained that those engaged in the industry have had sufficient opportunities to plan ahead, to quote the words he used in suggesting that we should commit ourselves to the expenditure of £800,000 during the next six and a half years. I am not studying this subject from a parochial viewpoint. It is not a matter of the Commonwealth assisting an individual State, but of whether the industry can prosper. If a case had been made out in support of the payment of a bounty <inline font-style="italic">on cotton</inline> I would have supported, the measure, but I have always been of the opinion, even before I entered "public life, that the profitable production of cotton in Australia is impracticable. As that opinion has not been destroyed by the arguments advanced by those supporting the Government, I cannot vote for the bill. </para>

                            <para>- I was a member of this chamber at the time,  but I did not know sufficient concerning the industry to justify me in opposing that measure. Apparently, the industry is now in such a chaotic state that the Government is endeavouring to assist it in the same way as it is helping other industries which are in difficulties, and which are receiving bounties. Surely in spending a little over £750,000 we have done sufficient salvage work to assist the industry to retrieve its position. In my opinion a case has not been made out, and as experience has conclusively proved that this industry will not assist in restoring our trade balance, provide additional employment, or result in increased land settlement, I intend to oppose the second reading of the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - Despite the pessimistic utterances which we have heard this afternoon from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> on the general economic position of Australia, and from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> on the prospects of successfully establishing the cotton industry in Australia, I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that the proposals of the Government will place the cotton industry on a sound basis. In submitting this measure for the encouragement of the cotton industry the Government has been charged with being unduly precipitate, but there are not many bills providing for the payment of bounties or for other purposes, which have received more consideration than this measure. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that the Government acted with undue haste and, in the main, departed from the recommendations of the Tariff Board, which were submitted after careful investigation. Apparently, the right honorable senator was not in possession of the latest report of the Tariff Board which contains recommendations of sufficient strength and importance to justify the introduction of this bill. The Tariff Board first conducted an investigation into this industry in 1925, and furnished a report to the late Government in 1926. Subsequently, the board was directed by that Government to hold another inquiry which was more comprehensive than that first undertaken. The second report which was presented on 6th March, 1929, dealt with practically every phase of the cotton industry, and the beneficial effect of its successful establishment upon other industries using cotton as a raw material. The board obtained evidence from all sections of the community including the growers, those in control of ginneries, manufacturers and importers, and with the fullest information, that it was possible to obtain made certain recommendations upon which this measure is framed. Certain portions of the Tariff Board's report should be closely studied by honorable senators before they record their votes on this measure. From the report of 6th March, 1929, I quote the following: </para>

                        <para>In its report of 5th May, 1926, on the question of the granting of bounty in respect of seed cotton, the Tariff Board dealt with this aspect of the matter and embodied therein statements supporting its view that the cultivation of cotton in the Commonwealth is highly desirable. It is not proposed in this report to traverse the whole of the information included in the previous report, but it may be well here to briefly refer to some of theo more weighty reasons which the board considers make it of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth that she produce as much of her requirements of cotton as is practicable. Briefly stated, the reasons are as follow : - </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> went on to say that no industry in this or any other country could depend upon permanency as regard prices and world conditions. "We all agree with the honorable senator on that point. This, I suggest, is one of the reasons actuating the Government in introducing this bill. The intention is to protect the cotton-growing industry in its infancy from the vagaries of world prices and conditions. Drastic fluctuations might crush a young industry, but might not materially affect one that is firmly established on a permanent and paying basis. To characterize the view of members of the Tariff Board as nonsense is to ignore fundamental truths in the history of development in Australia. I ask honorable -senators to consider the protection afforded to other primary industries. The comparison is quite germane to this discussion. Can they point to any primary industry which has not received assistance. Wheat-growing may be cited as one illustration. How much wheat would be grown in Australia to-day if successive State Governments had not constructed non-paying lines of railway to give growers access to their markets, and* nonpaying water schemes to aid in the occupation and development of agricultural land? These railway schemes are not always profitable even when production has increased, because the deliberate policy of successive railway administrations has been to fix low freights for the carriage of grain to encourage the outback producer, and ensure permanent land settlement. If honorable senators care to peruse the reports of the railways commissioners in the different States, they will find that millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money has been and is being spent in maintaining railway services solely in the interests of our primary producers. I have no doubt that the position in Western Australia is much the same as in any other State. </para>

                            <para>- These nonpaying lines of railway have also aided in the development of pastoral areas. The Commonwealth Government is responsible for the maintenance pf the railway line from Port Augusta to Alice Springs. That section is never likely to be profitable, but its construction and maintenance are justified for developmental purposes. Western Australia has several " sections of non-paying railways stretching out into its pastoral areas. Without these vital lines of communication, settlement of the land for pastoral or other purposes would be impossible. We might apply the same argument to the mining industry. Tasmania, Western Australia, and Queensland have constructed hundreds, if not thousands, of  miles of railway for the development of mineral fields which, after prospering for a few years, have been closed down; but unfortunately the liability in respect of railway construction remains for all time a burden upon the people. </para>

                    <para>The Government's proposal to assist the cotton-growing industry by providing for a bounty on raw cotton and protection in the allied secondary industry, is comparable in every respect with the action of successive State governments in spending large sums of public money on the construction of non-paying railway lines and water schemes for the benefit of the wheat-growers, pastoralists and other primary producers. Another important point which honorable senators would do well to remember is that Parliament affirmed this principle in  1926,  when it agreed to proposals introduced by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten.</inline> The underlying principle of the measure approved by Parliament in that year was identical with the principle contained in this bill. Under the  1926  proposals, the limit of expenditure over a period of five years was  £900,000.  Expenditure under this bill is not limited to any particular sum; but the Tariff Board, after careful investigation, estimates that the liability over a five-year period will be in the neighbourhood of  £800,000.  In view of the fact that in  1926  Parliament approved of a bill to stabilize the cotton industry until  1931,  I submit that those honorable senators who endorsed the principle then, to be consistent, must now support this measure. ' It is true that, as the present financial outlook is far from satisfactory, every item of proposed expenditure should be scrutinized with the greatest care. But there was the same need for close scrutiny of the  1926  proposal. A buoyant revenue is no reason why Parliament should approve of a scheme to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds over a period of years unless it is satisfied that the project is sound. In  1926  Parliament made available  £900,000,  spread over a period of five years, for the encouragement of the cotton-growing industry. Of that amount only  £290,000  has been spent to date. Since the actual expenditure is  £610,000  less than was contemplated, the industry now has a moral claim upon this Parliament for a continuance of the assistance provided under the  1926  act. If the total expenditure over the period of five years amounts to  £800,000,  the sum required, over and above the amount unexpended under the  1926  proposals, is about  £190,000. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that cotton-growing is a black man's industry, that it cannot be successfully established in Australia. We have always had our pessimists. I well remember that, some  25  years ago, when South Australia was producing about  12,000,000  bushels of wheat per annum, the pessimists of the day declared that no more wheat could be produced in that State. To-day, despite the widespread drought conditions of the last three years, South Australia produces approximately  25,000,000  bushels per annum. Given a normal season, the output will probably reach a maximum of  40,000,000  bushels, and over a period of years an average of about  35,000,000  bushels per annum should be maintained. </para>

Although the rabid freetrader may have died out, his mantle appears to have fallen on some honorable senators, who have claimed that secondary industries cannot be established in Australia. Secondary industries have been successfully established in this country. I remember when people asserted that it was not possible to build motor bodies here; that we should have to buy them for all time from America. Holden's engaged in the industry,  and  reduced the price of a certain type of body from  £82  to  £32.  If we accepted these pessimistic prophecies in their entirety, the whole progress of Australia would be retarded, and we should retrogress, instead of advancing, as every true Australian hopes and believes will be the case. </para>

                    <para>Let me examine for a moment the effect of the successful establishment of  the cotton industry on the trade position of Australia with the world generally. At present Australia imports approximately £11,000,000 worth of cotton goods annually, and about £2,000,000 worth of other fabrics in which cotton is a constituent part, so that our imports of cotton goods may be stated to be roughly about £13,000,000 per annum. According to the information contained in a report of the Tariff Board, and information supplied to the Government from other sources, goods representing at least half that amount could be produced in Australia once the industry was properly established here. A gold bonus and other benefits to improve the financial position of Australia are being brought forward for consideration. I ask honorable senators is it not better to endeavour to establish the cotton industry, at an expenditure of £800,000 spread over a period of five years, from which we could reasonably anticipate to reduce our imports by £7,000,000 annually? </para>

That method of stimulating the gold-mining industry would merely increase the return to those who have capital in the industry, most of whom are living abroad at the expense of the taxpayer. By expending a much smaller amount per annum to establish the cotton industry, we shall, if our reasonable anticipations are realized, provide employment for Australians and set up for the products of our primary and secondary industries a home market which, after all, is the best of all markets for a product of any industry. </para>

                    <para>Unemployment is a very important consideration at the present time. We have a huge number out of work. I do not suppose that there is any primary industry, with the exception, perhaps, of the viticultural industry, to which passing reference was made this afternoon, that has a greater capacity to absorb labour than cotton-growing. It is essentially a handwork industry. The cultivation of the cotton plant is substantially a gardener's job, the tilling of the soil and so on requiring a good deal of manual labour and personal supervision, while the picking of the cotton after it reaches maturity is essentially a hand labour job. So far none of the great inventors of the world have been successful in inventing a machine that will pick cotton mechanically. Those peculiarities give to the cotton industry a remarkable capacity to absorb labour. At a time like this, when practically every State in Australia is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in doles to the unemployed, for which nothing is, or can, be received in return, the establishment of such an industry would be providential. Only last week the Commonwealth Government granted £1,000,000 to the different States to assist them to relieve their unemployment. A flourishing cotton industry in Australia would employ those people and enable them to produce something that is necessary and of benefit to the community. </para>
                    <para>The secondary side of the industry is to be assisted by the bounty and also, we are told, by a measure of tariff protection once the producing stage is reached. Here again there are great potential avenues for employment. We know that whole counties in Great Britain are dependent on the cotton industry for their maintenance, and that whole communities in the United States of America, Japan, and other countries are similarly dependent on the industry. Why should not Australia participate in its benefits? </para>
                    <para>One of the last arguments with which I shall deal is that declaring that the measure is bound to fail because efforts to establish the cotton industry in Australia during the last 70 years have been unsuccessful. I understand that cotton was first grown in Queensland about 1860, and that it has been grown there with more or less success since. Until the 1926 Cotton Bounty Act was passed, no attempt was made to stimulate the side of the industry that is essential to its establishment. Previously, efforts were concentrated mainly on the production of cotton for export. That handicap upon the industry placed it at a disadvantage. We started out to  grow something that we need in Australia, but asked the growers to send the commodity abroad to be sold. That is corrected by this bill. An effective protection is to be afforded and adequate assistance given to those engaged in the manufacture of cotton products. That will provide a market for home-grown cotton, and disposes of the arguments that cotton-growing can never be successfully established in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>While it at present appears that the major benefit from the measure will be derived by the State of Queensland, there is more than a possibility that its benefits will extend to other States as the years pass, when the spinning section of the industry becomes firmly established. A demand will be created for Australian-grown cotton, and the needs of the community, so far as cotton is concerned, will be provided for. In South Australia, we have a large area of land on the banks of the river Murray that has been prepared for intense culture by the State at considerable expense. Dairying is now being carried on in some of those districts. In others, grapes are grown for the manufacture of wine and spirits, while other sections are used for the cultivation of fruits for the dried fruits market. My idea of intense culture is that a man should not be entirely dependent on one branch of production, but should engage in a number of activities, so that if one source of income fails he will still receive some return from the other sources. By assisting the cotton spinning industry we shall encourage the cultivation of cotton among small growers. I visualize the day when some of the valuable land in Western Australia, as well as in the other States, which is not now put to its full use, will be devoted to intense culture. </para>
                    <para>I ask honorable senators to recognize in this measure a genuine effort on the part of the Government to establish another primary industry in Australia - an industry which the Tariff Board's report clearly shows can be established here, and will be of great value to the nation by helping to solve its economic problems. </para>

                    <para class="block">At a time of great financial depression, when the Commonwealth is faced with the prospect of another heavy deficit, the Government has introduced  a  bill which will impose a heavy burden on the people of Australia for the next six years. Those who are engaged in our great primary industries are tired of being taxed by way of customs duties and bonuses to assist unprofitable and artificial industries in the Eastern States. The one redeeming feature about this bonus is that it will do something for a country district. As a rule, bonuses are granted to assist secondary industries established in the cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney. The present Government is already notorious for the burden it has added to the primary producers of Australia in the shape of tariff embargoes, increased protective duties generally, and bonuses. Practically the whole burden of these imposts is borne by our primary producers, particularly those engaged in the wheat, wool and mining industries. </para>

The result of the Government's policy so  far  has been to increase unemployment, raise the cost of living, and increase the cost of production. The Government has done things which it ought never to have attempted in a time of crisis. The present is  no  time to increase the burden on the  producers  of this country, who already have sufficient to face in the low prices  prevailing  for the commodities they  produce. </para>

                            <para>- Judging by my experience of the capable representatives of Queensland in this Parliament, I predict that long before the expiration of five years we shall have requests for more and still more assistance to the cotton industry. The people of Australia will be called upon to assist the cotton industry for five years whether or not the industry is profitable to those engaged in it. But how does the Government treat the wheat industry - a natural industry on which the prosperity of this country to a very great extent depends? It has asked the farmers of Australia to grow more wheat, which means 'that, instead of working twelve hours a day, they are expected to work fourteen hours. As an inducement, it has guaranteed a certain price for each bushel of wheat produced. But, in contradistinction to its attitude towards the cotton industry, the Government will not accept the whole of the risk and agree to a bonus of, say, 6d. a bushel on all wheat produced, irrespective of the price received for that wheat in the markets of the world. In inaugurating this socialistic marketing scheme, the Government expects the States, whose treasuries are well nigh depleted, to accept half of the financial responsibility, in the event of any losses being incurred, the Commonwealth paying the other 50 per cent. That meagre assistance to a vital industry is to continue, not for five years as in the case of the cotton bonus, but for only one year. When the Wheat Marketing Bill was before another place an amendment was moved to provide that, iri the event of a loss in the marketing of the wheat, the Commonwealth's moiety of the guarantee should be paid even if a State was not a party to the pool, but the Government would not accept it. How different is its treatment of the cotton industry! </para>

If, contrary to my wishes, the bill is carried, I can only hope that the efforts of the Government will be successful. I realize that if the industry can be established by . means of political action, the Government will spare no pains to do so, and one means towards that is the payment of a bounty for a short term of six years in addition to very heavy tariff duties, which I fear will be a burden on the workers and other established primary industries. The Queensland Government is not to be asked to join in any guarantee or to participate in the payment of the bounty. The Commonwealth Government is to be the fairy godmother and to do everything possible to bring about the establishment of the cotton industry. </para>

The industry itself pays the bounty; but the bounty itself is confined to the product of vineyards established before March, 1928. In Western Australia we have huge areas of viticultural land not yet developed. If they are planted with vines the people who develop them will derive no assistance from the wine bounty. </para>

I hope that in the future we shall grow cotton there as well. We have huge areas of good viticultural land awaiting development, but those who plant them with vines will not be able to  participate in the wine bounty. Only established vineyards in South Australia and the Eastern States will share in that benefit. Such is the limitation fixed by the Wine Export Bounty Act. When it comes to cotton, it is quite a different matter. </para>

                    <para>There is another difference between this bill and the Wine Export Bounty Act. If the cotton-growers are prepared to grow more and more cotton, there is no limit to the total amount of bounty payable; whereas in the case of the bounty on exported wine, not only has the subsidy to be provided by the industry itself, but new areas devoted to vines cannot receive the bounty. The Commonwealth Government is certainly treating the cotton industry very well. But it seems to me to be a general practice to treat the industries in in the Eastern States favorably in comparison with industries that are natural to and capable of flourishing in Western Australia. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> is like an eastern potentate levying tribute here and distributing largess there. It may be accident, design or coincidence that meagre assistance is given by successive governments to industries natural to Western Australia,, while, at great cost, either through tariff protection or bounties, favorable treatment is extended to the industries in the Eastern States. But it seems to us in Western Australia that it is more than coincidence ; that it is something we can regard as an incurable habit. In other words the people of Western Australia are expected to pay tribute and the people in the Eastern States get whatever largess is being distributed. It may be claimed by the Government that this cannot be avoided because new industries are first started in the Eastern States. </para>

                    <para>I warn the Government that the burden on primary industries is becoming too heavy. In answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> in another place on the 10th December last, the Treasurer gave the amounts paid for seven years to the different States in direct assistance from the Federal Government. The total was £4,973,543. Of that amount New South Wales received £1,969,762, of which the bounty for the manufacture of iron and steel products, represented £1,455,503. The amounts paid to the other States were: Victoria £702,240, Queensland £575,841, South Australia £963,260, Western Australia £95,209, and Tasmania £60,960. Of the amount paid to Western Australia £41,375 represented the amount of compensation paid by the Commonwealth because of an outbreak of rinderpest. Had that outbreak occurred in any other State the compensation would have been payable in that State and the direct assistance given to Western Australia reduced to £53,834 out of a total of £4,973,543. It is only natural that representatives of Western Australia, in view of these figures, should look with a good deal of anxiety at the prospect of having to share in the payment of another bounty from which, for many years at any rate, it cannot expect to get any direct benefit. I credit the Government with good intentions, but the burden on primary industries is becoming altogether too heavy. The increased unemployment in Australia to-day is largely due to the bolstering of artificial industries at the expense of the great and established primary industries. Wheat, wool, mining and timber all have to stand on their own bottoms in the markets of the world, and it is impossible for them to do so, with the prevailing low prices, while they have to continue contributing heavily to the payment of bounties and duties to foster secondary and other in.dustries </para>

                        <para>. -  I have a great deal of sympathy with the cotton-growers because I realize the difficulties under which they are labouring to-day and the very great difficulties confronting their industry. I am rather surprised to hear those honorable senators who claim to represent primary producers urging that assistance should not be given to the cotton industry, on the ground that it imposes an additional burden on primary producers. But cotton-growing is a primary production. There is too often a tendency to regard wheat and wool-growing as the only industries that are truly representative of primary production. It cannot be urged that, by assisting the cotton-growers, we shall be placing a further burden upon the primary producers, because the cotton-growers are themselves primary producers. </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator shortly. It is the responsibility of this Parliament to do all that is practicable to assist those engaged in the industry. The first attempt in that direction was when the Commonwealth Government entered into an agreement with the Queensland Government, which was done with a full knowledge of the facts of the case. At that time glowing accounts were given of the future of the industry, not only by those actually engaged in the work of cotton-growing, but by the Minister who introduced the bill under which the bounty was first paid, and by those who supported the measure. It was then said that, from the stand-point of increasing primary production and land settlement, and also of the importance of the industry from a defence view-point, it should be firmly established in Australia. It was contended at that time that Australia should produce all its requirements so that, in the event of war, we would be a self-contained nation. Many reasons were advanced why an agreement should be entered into with the Queensland Government. </para>

                            <para>- It has to an extent; nevertheless it is to-day a very important industry, and I cannot support the opinion that it should go out of existence if it cannot carry on without assistance in the form of a bounty. In entering into an agreement with the Queensland Government, and so accepting certain obligations, the Commonwealth induced cotton-growers to establish homes and farms, and also to invest capital. They felt that the Commonwealth was behind them, and whatever the intentions of the Government may have been at that time, I am confident that it was the intention of the Parliament to assist them. The Government did not definitely tell the growers that it would stick to them whatever happened; but there was an implied obligation which we have to honour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> asked how many persons were engaged in the cotton-growing industry, and for the information of the Senate I shall quote some figures supplied to me by a representative of the industry. The present production of cotton is approximately 10,000 bales per annum. There are from 2,500 to 3,000 pickers employed in the industry, who are paid £10 per bale of lint, so that £100,000 is paid to the cotton-pickers for their labour. </para>

                            <para>- Arbitration Court judges have made some peculiar statements, and I would have to see exactly what was said before accepting the honorable senator's interpretation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> said that he is opposed to the policy of bolstering  up certain industries at the expense of others. That, generally speaking, is a correct view. No one wishes to see industries operating at the expense of others, but such industries often benefit others. </para>

The growers, who are directly concerned in the industry, will, when operating on a co-operative basis, be satisfied for the time being if they can obtain an adequate return for the cotton they produce. In the absence of ginneries and mills it would be almost impossible for them to dispose of their cotton at a reasonable price ; but if the ginneries and mills are in operation they will be able to market their produce at a reasonable rate, and will not require such a big return upon the capital invested as the original promoters. As the growers are to take over the Undertaking at a reduced capital cost they may be able to make a success of it. </para>

                            <para>- Illustrations of that sort may be applied in various ways. It is the duty of this Parliament to give the fullest possible assistance to the cotton-growing industry. The fact that finance is difficult at the moment is not a sufficient reason for abandoning the growers, with their wives and families, and allowing them to sink in a sea of industrial trouble. We certainly must do something for them. The Commonwealth, having entered into certain obligations, must honour them. For this reason I hope that the measure will receive more sympathetic consideration at the hands of those honorable senators who have yet to speak in this debate than it has received from those who have spoken already. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - That is so. I hold the opinion that neither bounties nor tariffs are a satisfactory means for the solution of our difficulties. Free trade or protection, as policies, are not capable of satisfying modern requirements, whatever they may have done in the past. As for countries being self-contained, I agree with those who argue that if we export certain commodities we must, to some extent, import other commodities. I was impressed by some of the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> as to the effect of bounties on production, and I am living in the hope that one day bounties will become universal and that, by paying bounties to each other, we shall eventually legislate ourselves into a degree of general prosperity. I suspect, however, that when the scheme to assist the gold-mining industry by means of a bounty is before this chamber we shall hear other views from the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - I am not sufficiently in the confidence of the Government to be able to answer the honorable senator; but I am foretelling that some honorable senators opposite will follow a different line of argument when that long-extended golden vista is presented to our gaze. </para>
                    <para>It appears to me that the arguments against this bill are based mainly upon the failure of bounties to fulfil expectations. But, as one honorable senator said, we gain by experience. Consequently, former failures may possibly lead to the adoption of methods which will ensure future success. It is apparent that the original bounty provisions were not well balanced, for it is clearly impossible, under existing conditions, to build up a big export trade in cotton until we first satisfy our own requirements. Since  cotton-growing  is a primary, and the spinning of cotton, a secondary, industry, to make the primary industry successful it is essential that we should extend the bounty system to the spinning of the yarn. Consequently, we must consider cotton? growing as both- a primary and a secondary industry. Both branches must be equally subsidized. It is ridiculous to encourage the production of raw cotton and depend upon the markets of the world for its sale, when at the same time we require enormous quantities of cotton piece goods for the home market. </para>

                        <para>- That is another reason why we should consider this proposal from the international standpoint. Honorable senators .opposite would scout the. idea of any alliance between the workers of Australia and the workers of cheap labour countries. That, however, is the true line of progress. Instead of encouraging importations from cheap labour countries and breaking down Australian industrial conditions, it should he the objective of all parties to help raise the industrial standards in other countries and so make possible the fair exchange of goods between Australia and the rest of the world. At present, trade with cheap-labour countries is a menace to the industrial standards observed in Australia, The workers pf Japan, I suggest, are no more desirous of working for a miserable wage than are the white workers of this country. Consequently the soundest fiscal policy for Australia to adopt would be to spend money in sending abroad industrial missionaries to teach the people of cheap-labour countries to organize,- as we have done, and have as' their objective higher wages and improved working conditions. They would then be less dangerous as competitors in trade. I firmly believe that the salvation of the nations in the future lies in the direction of improving the conditions of the ill-paid coolie workers of India, China, and other eastern countries. </para>

                    <para>Cotton-growing has been referred to as exclusively a Queensland industry. It is true that it is confined mainly to the northern State, but there is no reason why it should not extend to other States. I have seen excellent varieties of cotton growing on the western slopes of New South Wales, and I fail to see why it should not be successfully cultivated in many parts of the Commonwealth. The climate there is not less, favorable than in certain portions of the United . States of America, where it has been grown, successfully for many years. . As. for the cost of production, a point that was emphasized by Senators Colebatch, Payne, and others, there is no reason to f  fear, since  this will be largely a family industry, and, therefore, will not be affected by the labour, provisions in the bill. There is nothing in it to prevent the owner of a small farm from carrying out the whole of his operations on a family basis. It is only where outside labour is employed that .the provisions of the bill relating to wages and conditions of work will operate- Where an industry is assisted by means of a bounty the Government should insist o,n the observance of reasonable labour conditions. I should oppose the payment of a bounty without this condition. I am unable to say if the insertion of such a provision is constitutional or otherwise, but there is good reason to believe that it is, because decisions of the High Court have prescribed the limits to which the Commonwealth can go. in legislation- of this kind, and it is not probable that the draftsman of this bill would include in it provisions that were unconstitutional. However, this is a matter for judicial decision. I contend that it is a necessary part of our duty to prescribe reasonable working conditions in respect of any industry that receives assistance by way of a bounty or protection through the customs. </para>

                            <para>- If that is so, the payment of a bounty on the production of gold will impoverish the people of Western Australia, and I fear that the representatives of that State in this chamber will be led astray by local agitation, and will advocate a policy which may bring ruin to their State. But, seriously, if the bounty system is good, and if it is economically sound to assist an industry for which there is room and for which the soil is adapted, as in the case of cotton-growing, there can be no reason why we should not encourage the development of that enterprise. I am not suggesting that the emancipation of labour will follow the payment of bounties, the imposition of tariff duties, or any such system. I believe that very much greater and more fundamental changes in our social system will have to be made before we can raise the general standard of living to what I hope we shall one day attain. Nevertheless, it is anomalous that a country like Australia,' in which there are large areas suitable for cotton-growing, should import practically all its requirements in cotton goods. Any proposal to encourage the growing of cotton and the manufacture in Australia of cotton piece goods should be commended, instead of being opposed by certain honorable senators. The main burden of the attack that has been made on this measure, both by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch,</inline> is that past payments of a cotton bounty have not met with the success anticipated: the industry has not been placed on a sound footing. As a previous  speaker  pointed out the failure of one organization is not proof that failure must necessarily continue. The mistakes of the past afford us lessons for the future. The original bounty brought about an over-production of raw cotton and provided no market for it. That lesson should assist us when providing for the industry in future, and I believe that this measure will overcome the difficulty. </para>

                    <para>It must be realized that it is not only for the manufacturer of cotton goods that the raw product can be utilized. Cotton seed can be used for many purposes. I have here a paper that gives a list of the different articles and commodities into which it can be manufactured. I shall not weary honorable senators by reading the list, but I may mention that it embraces scores of substances, which in themselves form the raw material for other secondary industries. Fertilizers, explosives, and numerous other articles can be manufactured from cotton seed and cotton lint. The fact that it is possible to establish so many industries from the by-products alone should stimulate us in our endeavour to place cotton-growing on a sound footing in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Although the first benefits will be reaped by Queensland, subsequent advantages will be shared by practically every other State in the Commonwealth. If, unfortunately, Western Australia will not participate in the promised prosperity in an equal degree one must take into consideration the peculiar circumstances of that State. It has an area equal to about one quarter the size of Europe and is inhabited by less than 500,000 souls. It is unreasonable for those who represent so enormous and so undeveloped a State to hope to develop it within a short space of time. We cannot forgo the advantages enjoyed by the other States of the Commonwealth simply because it is impossible at the moment to confer similar advantages on Western Australia. On the other hand we can foresee that, in the development of this continent, which is the obligation of the whole of its inhabitants, no unfair treatment will be meted out to any State, but that steps will be taken to adjust the balance. Any disadvantage temporarily sustained by Western Australia will be eventually counteracted by the collective action of the people of Australia, and I am confident that that State will have nothing to fear when it puts forward any just claim for assistance. </para>
                    <para>A good deal of misunderstanding has arisen from statements made in a report by the Tariff Board on the cotton industry. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> quoted certain recommendations from that report, but he failed to refer to a later report by the board in which a number of those recommendations and statements are considerably modified in the light of subsequent experience. It is reasonable to assert that if the Tariff Board is worthy of the confidence of those who appointed it, some of the facts that have since emerged with regard to the cotton industry justify the proposals now before the Senate. As a result of the stimulus given by the Cotton Bounty Act of 1926, the cotton production of Australia increased in 1927 by more than 100 per cent, over the crop of the previous year. Unfortunately there existed a lack of means to convert that cotton  into a secondary product. That fact compelled those who favoured the establishment of the industry to seek new avenues through which it should be given the necessary encouragement. They pointed out that it was essential to provide assistance for the spinning of the yarn, but it took two years before anything was really done. By that time the period of the bounty had almost expired, and those engaged in the cotton industry were in a state of uncertainty as to how they would be treated. Parliamentary delay was largely responsible for the retrogression of the industry, which was largely the result of uncertainty as to its future. If adopted, this measure will put an end to that uncertainty and give growers reasonable security for a number of years. If by that time the industry is not soundly established, provided no unforeseen difficulties arise, those who see fit may offer resistance to a continuation of the bounty. </para>

If the system of bounties is unsound, it is even more unsound to begin to build up an industry by such means and then, just when there is a prospect of placing it on its feet, to withdraw the assistance. </para>

                            <para>- Australia has been proved to be suitable for the growing of cotton, and, as we have a population that consumes millions of pounds worth of cotton material annually, there is no reasonable ground for asserting that it is impossible to establish the industry. I am of the opinion that we should not depend entirely upon wheat, wool and a few lesser industries for the maintenance of Australia. Each of those activities has its limits, and it is a sound old adage that you should not have all your eggs in one basket. We should endeavour to establish a multitude of industries so that a slump in one will not materially affect the country. The people of Australia require cotton goods. Australia is capable of producing cotton, and of manufacturing anything that any other nation can manufacture, given the market for it. This mania for foreign markets can be easily overdone, particularly when we make no attempt to supply our own markets. I believe that we have committed grave blunders in failing to build up our secondary industries. Australia produces infinitely more wool than it requires, and it should long ago have rectified the anomaly of having to send practically all of its wool overseas, and then to buy back millions of pounds worth. of woollens.The same remarks may. be applied to our wheat industry. We might well have concentrated upon the manufacture of flour, and the establishment of a market for it overseas. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - I doubt it. I mention, incidentally, that when I was a boy, flour was imported into Australia in barrels from the United States of America. We could also have done more in connexion with the manufacture of products from the offal resulting from the manufacture of flour, such as stock foods. </para>
                    <para>It cannot be gainsaid that there is a tremendous market in Australia for cotton goods of various kinds, and it is high time that we placed the industry on a sound footing. I do not urge that simply for the purpose of excluding the imports of cotton goods from other countries. It will always be found that there are special types of goods that cannot be manufactured in any one country, and that must necessarily be imported. Therefore, trade between civilized communities and nations is a natural development, There is, however, no reason why we should for ever remain hewers' of wood and drawers of water for other nations, allowing them to carry on the profitable industries of the world while we pay top prices for their goods. In the matter of secondary industries the most progressive nations are those which are most highly industrialised. The process of industrialising this country is now going on : and even if it is not being carried out on strictly sound economic principles, it is better that it should be attempted by some means than that it should not be done at all. I look forward to the time when this country will have become so industrialised as to make the position of the Labour - movement better than it now is. To our secondary industries we must look to supply men who will see that the workers of the country receive their just share of what is offering. For that reason I welcome the establishment of secondary industries. </para>
                    <para>This bounty is one of many which this Parliament has considered. Most of the bounties which have been granted in the past have been for the benefit of certain sections of the employing capitalistic class. Anything that the workers can get out of them, particularly in the direction of insisting that the wage-earner shall be adequately remunerated, they are entitled to. Indeed, provision to that end should be an integral part of all industrial legislation. </para>

In my opinion, a reasonable limit means all that labour can effectively demand. As the chief producers of wealth, the workers are entitled to the lion's share of the result of their industry. The extent to which they share those proceeds depends upon their organization. When labour is sufficiently organized it will be able to take the lot. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators have not shown a great deal of enthusiasm for this bill. It is indeed extremely difficult to decide the best course to take to assist the cotton industry in Australia, the history of which was given fully by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> The bill before us proposes to grant additional assistance to that industry by way of a bounty and additional tariff protection. It is difficult to determine to what extent we are justified in giving it artificial stimulus; but because large numbers of people have been induced to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> in for cotton production, and because the bill is designed to assist them, I shall support it, although without any great enthusiasm. I am prepared to give these people a further chance to establish their industry on a sound basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> adopted an extraordinary line of argument when he said that if cotton were a commodity which Australia could export, the industry was worth assisting, but not otherwise. In my opinion, there is no essential difference between exporting cotton to the value of £1,000,000, and so increasing our own cotton production as to render unnecessary the importation of cotton of that value. By producing cotton in our own country, we shall not only employ our own people, but we shall also keep in Australia money which otherwise would be sent to other countries to pay for cotton and cotton goods imported. The honorable senator's remarks appear the more extraordinary when one remembers his recent enthusiastic support of a bill to provide a bounty on wine. </para>

                            <para>- It is a distinction without a difference. The honorable senator says that the wine industry will pay the bounty on exported wine. That is not so ; the people of Australia will pay the bounty. It is only playing with words  to  say that the industry will pay the bounty. </para>

                            <para>- Had the Government brought down a proposal to compensate the people engaged in the production of cotton, and to set them up in some other industry which had a greater chance of success, I believe it would have been better for all concerned. If honorable senators refer to a speech I made some years ago, when a measure to assist those who had grown doradillo grapes was before the Senate, they will see that I suggested then, that it would be better to root out the vines and to grant the growers compensation and establish them in other pursuits, </para>

                    <para>Rightly or wrongly, this Parliament has approved of the principle of granting bounties to assist various industries. I am somewhat apprehensive regarding this bounty, but I am prepared to give the cotton-growing industry one more chance to establish itself on a sound footing. At the same time, I feel that the time is ripe for a careful review of the whole matter of granting bounties. In the case of the cotton-growing industry, we should insist that a competent authority shall determine the areas in which it is most likely to be established successfully, and also the varieties  of cotton  to be grown. It is wrong to grant bounties indiscriminately, without proper investigation. We should embody in this legislation a provision to ensure that the industry will be carried on in such a way as to give it a reasonable chance of success.From time to time, Tasmanian members of this Parliament have urged that assistance should be given to Tasmanian industries. I suggest that had assistance been given to the Tasmanian evaporated apple trade, thousands of bushels of apples which were left to waste, would have been turned into a marketable commodity. That Tasmania has to a great extent been unsuccessful in obtaining assistance for her industries, is no reason why Tasmanian representatives should refuse to assist other industries. I shall support the bill only in order to give the industry a further chance to establish itself on a sound footing. </para>

                            <para>- I quite appreciate the speech made by the honorable senator. It was beyond all argument one which it is difficult to combat ; but there is so much money involved in the cotton industry, and so many interests, that I am inclined to give it one more chance. There may be something in this bill which will give the industry a further opportunity to prove that it can be of some assistance, not only to Queensland, but also to the rest of Australia. I support the second reading. </para>
