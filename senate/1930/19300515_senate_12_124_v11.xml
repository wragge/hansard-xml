            <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce has pointed out, it is necessary to trace the history of the legislation and arbitration affecting waterside workers over  a  number of years in order thoroughly to understand this motion and the regulation which it seeks to disallow. Honorable senators will recall that for some considerable time trouble was simmering on the waterfront, and that it came to a head upon the promulgation of the Beeby award. Whether one agrees with that award or not, one has to admit that it is the law of the land, and, as such, must be honoured by all right-thinking people. When the award was promulgated members of the Waterside Workers Federation: went out on strike. They paralyzed our shipping and held our trade and commerce up to ransom. Because they disagreed with the decision of a body created by the people of Australia to determine wages and conditions of employment, they defied the law, and said, in effect, "We do not like the law of the land, and we refuse to obey it." </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>read a highly informative statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackburn</inline> which gives the history of the Beeby award, and proves conclusively that the watersiders have brought all this trouble on their heads by their own action. I propose to quote somewhat extensively from the award of Judge Beeby, and to give the reasons which caused the learned judge to arrive at his decision." In reviewing the history of legislation and conditions affecting waterside workers, judge Beeby intimated that when the court first began its investigation into the matter some years previously those workers were a very badly organized body. He then pointed out how their conditions and wages had been bettered by the operation of the Arbitration Court.It is evident that the men were quite willing to accept wages and conditions that were favorable to them, but that they revolted when awards were not to their liking. Judge Beeby said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I was surprised at the tendency of some witnesses to live in the past, and to assume that the conditions existing prior to 1914 still prevail, and also at the avowal by some union, representatives that while the court's awards had been of great benefit, the union was entitled, during the currency of those awards, by direct action at moments when pressure was likely to be effective, to compel compliance with conditions which had not been prescribed by the court. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">During the hearing of their plaint, the union raised a contention that has been put forward by honorable senators opposite, that the blame was wholly attributable to the ship-owners; that most of the disputes of recent years were the result of pin-pricking tactics on the part of foremen. After hearing evidence on this point, Judge Beeby said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I asked for evidence in support of this statement, but none of a convincing nature was forthcoming. I have no doubt that foremen are as any other group of human beings, and that some of them at times act indiscreetly. But there is not a scintilla of evidence that the bullying " ganger " of the old days is now tolerated on the waterfront. A substantial percentage of foremen, are members of the federation: Practically all of them in the past have had experience as working labourers. When this was pointed out it was alleged that whilst they do not now" bully" mcn, foremen when picking up labour, , exclude those who " stand up for their rights ", | Again 1 asked for evidence in support of such a charge, but it was not forthcoming. </para>

            <para>X was reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the federation and some of its vigilance mid other officers, more than the workmen themselves, have been responsible for most of the unrest of recent times on the waterfront, nui that much disorder has been fomented v purposes other than the remedying of legitimate grievances. Occasionally, the federation has been caught in a maelstrom of industrial disorder set in motion by some other body of workmen. Sympathy strikes have at times been beyond the control of the federation's governing body, but the federation must' accept responsibility for most of the sectional strikes and the holding up of individual ships in different ports. These stoppages of work have usually arisen from demands by groups of men, backed up by a branch executive, or by the federal committee of management itself, for restrictive conditions, not authorized by the court;' from attempts to enforce local nz les or regulations in conflict with the award; from refusal to accept the decisions of boards of reference on disputed points; from efforts <inline font-style="italic">t{&gt;</inline> secure payment of excessive rates for special work without submission to boards of reference; from demands for increases in the number of hands employed without reference to boards ; from enforcing the " fair division of work " policy by demanding the employment of more men than were fairly necessary; from efforts to destroy the mobility of labour employed, and from the adoption by the committee of management and branch executives of a new policy aiming at securing control without responsibility of waterside operations in the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">That is a scathing indictment by the learned judge of those union organizers. The employers were even blamed by the judge for being too lenient, for not enforcing the awards of the courts, arid for yielding to demands not in accordance with those awards. I know of one instance in Port Adelaide in which a union demanded conditions over and above those set out in the award. </para>

This regulation overrides the intention of that award, which provided that the times and places for the engagement of " labour existing on certain dates were to continue until varied by agreement or by findings of boards of reference; but the committee of management of the union, in defiance of that provision, directed all branches to adopt only one pick-up. Both morning and afternoon pick-ups were provided for, and the practice of two pick-ups daily was in. operation in most of the ports throughout Australia.

Before dealing with the various claims, the learned judge referred to the evidence called by the employers in support of their contention that since the first award had been made there had been an appreciable decline in efficiency. A return was submitted showing that there had been a good deal of unnecessary delay in the handling of cargo which resulted in increased prices being charged not only for the requirements of. primary producers, but for many commodities used by other sections of the community. If this regulation is allowed to remain in operation, members of the Waterside Workers Federation will again secure control and abuse their powers as they did previously, resulting in considerable hardships being inflicted upon practically every section of the community. If the volunteer workers are forced to seek employment at the same pick-up as members of the federation, they will he badgered, heckled and perhaps bludgeoned into joining the union.

              <para>- They were members, of the Waterside Workers Federation. In many cases volunteer workers have handled a larger tonnage in a specified time than unionists and as they become more experienced the figures will doubtless improve. In the circumstances, which have been fully brought before the Senate by other honorable senators on this side of the chamber, there does not appear to be any reason why this regulation should be allowed. Its operation would result in considerable conflict between the members of the Waterside Workers Federation and the volunteers. It would give the members of that federation an opportunity to conduct work under conditions which for years were detrimental to the interests of the community. The promise which was given to the volunteers should be honoured. </para>

A perusal of the comments on the draft award, however, discloses that the matters referred to have not been seriously considered. The federation has merely traversed the award and objected to every clause which is not in accord with its claim filed in the court. It pays no heed to the reasons for the alterations in the old award. Time alone can tell whether this attitude will persist. I can only repeat and extend what I said in my original judgment. If, in future, the federation can satisfy the court that it has changed its policy, the court will afford every opportunity for application for improvement of conditions. </para>

              <para>--It is rather terrible to contemplate, because the men were already enjoying substantial benefits under arbitration. The award rate of pay was 2s. ll£d. per hour. In some instances double time was allowed and the conditions of employment were made as easy as possible. All these matters were taken into account by Judge Beeby in determining the claim for preference. If preference had been awarded, volunteer workers would have been compelled to join the union, the alternative being lack of employment on the waterfront and the prospect of starvation. At one time the award relating to work on the waterfront provided for preference to unionists, and in the draft award Judge Beeby proposed, with certain exceptions, to grant preference. He said that in view of the failure of the federation in its comment on the minutes, to even admit the necessity for controlling branches and disciplining groups of men who failed to observe awards, clause 19 of the minutes of the award would be struck out and no order for preference made. He deliberately refrained from giving preference. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I come- now to a point made very cleverly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> yesterday. The Leader of the Senate endeavoured to persuade honorable senators that the new statutory rule would not over-ride the award of the court, because the court had not power to deal with non-unionists. But the court has power to grant preference to unionists,' and for the reasons which I have already cited, Judge Beeby deliberately refrained from doing so.  Had  preference been granted, any volunteer worker who failed to join the union, would have been shut out from employment, because only unionists would have been called first, and non-unionists would get a job only when labour was short. But the court would not ' give preference to unionists, i,t would not do something' which would amount to compelling  a  man to join a union. The regulation we ar-3 considering would, in effect, force the men into a union and would override the decision of the Arbitration Court. If all waterside workers are forced to assemble at one pick-up place, there will" be constant friction between  unionists and non-unionists, and trouble will ensue instead of peace as predicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly.

              <para>- I regret that other honorable senators have had an opportunity to relate what happened at Port Adelaide and that I am not permitted to put the other side of the case. I shall now content myself with saying that during the clash between unionists and non-unionists acts of violence were committed at Port Adelaide, that five men were taken to the Adelaide hospital, and that there were many other casualties. I am definitely opposed to the regulation laid on the table of the Senate. It will not make for peace in the waterside industry. Trouble occurred also at the port of Melbourne, where non-unionists were attacked arid in some cases chased through the streets by mobs of unionists. If all waterside workers are forced to assemble at one pick-up place unionists and non-unionists will be thrown together. The ship-owners promised that the non-unionists would be given preference; it was a. promise that could be given quite in accordance with the award of the arbitration court; but with non-unionists and unionists all mixed up at one common pick-up place the shipowners will no longer be able to honour that promise. The regulation, if allowed to stand, will bring about the badgering and butchering of men who came to the assistance of the country when the unionists went on strike, holding up the trade and commerce of Australia, and inflicting great loss and suffering on the general community. The regulation is not in the best interests of the people, and I shall certainly vote for the motion. </para>

            <para>. - After six months in office the present Labour Government has suddenly decided that unionist wharf labourers in Melbourne are not getting their fair share of work. In plain English, the Ministry has been compelled to take certain steps with the object of forcing volunteer labour off the Melbourne waterfront. Hence this regulation now under discussion. I listened to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> yesterday afternoon with great interest, and, I must say, with a great deal of admiration for the extraordinarily fine show he put up in pleading a lamentably weak case. I think we are all familiar with the dislocation and chaos that towards the end of 1928, when the Transport Workers Act was passed, caused enormous damage and loss to the community generally, until eventually, largely with the aid of volunteer labour, shipping services were restored. On that occasion the volunteers, who took the place of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation who would not obey an award of the Arbitration Court, were promised permanent preference of waterside work, a privilege which the Waterside Workers Federation had enjoyed for a long time, but apparently valued very little. Since the advent of volunteer labour during the last sixteen or eighteen months, ships have been loaded and unloaded expeditiously, and in some ports pillaging has been reduced. The Government of the day and ship-owners gave a pledge that, when the strike was over, the volunteer workers would be protected in their employment. It is the first occasion that I can remember of a promise made to volunteers who have come to the aid of the community at a time of trouble being honoured. That pledge has been faithfully kept up to now; but ever since the election of this Government there have been ominous rumblings of impending trouble for the volunteers, and threats that the present satisfactory position would be altered. It is clear that the present Ministry did not relish any move in that direction, but as a first step it has ordered a common pick-up place for unionists and volunteers, and I submit the latter can only attend at some considerable risk to themselves. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that police protection is unnecessary; that no more police are inquired at the pick-up place than before. On the 16th April, when I was on my way to Tasmania during the Easter recess, I saw about 2,000 people assembled in the vicinity of No. 10 and No. 11 berths on the north side of the river Yarra. It is possible that many of them were merely onlookers but in attendance there were a dozen, perhaps more, mounted troopers and about 30 or 40 foot police. That was two days after the promulgation of this regulation. It is true that there was no trouble on that occasion, but having had a good deal to do with large bodies of men in different parts of the world I am a pretty good judge, and it was obvious to me, as it would have been to any spectator, that there was in that great gathering all the elements of very serious trouble at any time. A thoughtless act could easily have brought about trouble. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline>is an optimist when he says that the idea of having a common pick-up place is to enable the two parties to come together and fraternize. In the absence of adequate police protection I can imagine a jolly good " box on ", which at a later date some Labour poet may probably immortalize in a poem entitled, " How we beat the scabs at Hogan's Flat". Human nature being what it is there is bound to be a clash when two bodies of men of opposing interests are brought together at a common pick-up place and there is no buffer in the shape of police. Some people are bound to get rather badly hurt. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator THOMPSON</inline>(Queensland) [4.3 1 .  - It appears to me that the direct effect of this statutory rule will be to bring two absolutely hostile sections of workers together at one common pick-up place. In the past there has been a considerable difference of opinion between these sections which has taken the form of assaults and actions not to the credit of the Labour movement, and will any one say that these two bodies can meet in this way on one common pick-up place without getting into "holts " or coming to clashes ? The danger of that is very great indeed. It has been urged that up to the present the statutory rule has functioned satisfactorily; but it has already been shown that the hostile elements have been kept in check by the presence of large bodies of police. There is, however, an even greater incentive to the absence of trouble. The unionists are not likely to indulge in any hostile act until this statutory rule becomes the law of the land. It is not yet the law of the land and I hope that it never will be. The. Government is in an awkward position. It is its duty to do all things to preserve law and order, but in doing so it comes into conflict with its supporters, the unions. I shall quote a few lines from a most pertinent statement by that gifted writer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Maine, in his <inline font-style="italic">Popular Government.</inline> At page 64 of that work, he wrote - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If any Government should be tempted to neglect even for a moment its functions of compelling obedience to law - if a democracy, for example, were to allow a portion of the multitude of which  it  consists to set at defiance some law which  it  happens to dislike, it would bc guilty of a crime which hardly any other virtue would redeem, and which century after century might fail  to  repair. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those are weighty words indeed, and are very applicable to the case in point. The Government will be inclined to favour the unionists upon whom it relies for support. At the same time it is bound by its oath of office to maintain law and order. Undoubtedly, it has a very difficult problem in front of it. I refer to that aspect of the matter because, although I should like to be allowed to roam over the whole subject and cite our experiences in Queensland, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have very properly ruled that out. I shall content myself with bringing forward that phase and commending it to the attention of the Government. At the same time I shall oppose the legalizing of this statutory rule. </para>

          <para>The members of the Waterside Workers Federation are just realizing the inexorable operation of the  law  of cause and effect. They have been forced in a very bitter way to appreciate the biblical words, " As a man soweth, so shall he reap ". The wharf labourers  are  indeed reaping a very disagreeable harvest. Some of their sowing was done in all ignorance, but much of it was carried out  with  due deliberation. The members of  the  Waterside Workers Federation endeavoured to take advantage of this country to further their own selfish  ends,  and their reprehensible action has  haa  a boomerang effect. I realize that some of them went into the business deliberately, and that others had not the moral courage to prevent their comrades leading them astray. Now this Government is going out of its way to assist members of that federation, under the guise of endeavouring to solve the problem  that  now exists at Port Melbourne. As usual, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> yesterday spoke from  the  heart instead of from the head. The honorable senator is very easily moved to give expression to his sentimental feelings rather than to his sound reasoning and experience. </para>

              <para>- Yesterday the honorable senator did not. He pleaded a pathetic case and urged that justice should be meted out to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation  and  their starving families. How in the  name  of common sense will this regulation bring work to the watersiders at Port Melbourne or any other port? All  the  ports in Australia are suffering equally with Port Melbourne. If we take the evidence advanced by the secretary of the Wharf Labourers Union, Melbourne, we find that a great deal of the present distress is due to the policy of high protection and prohibition of certain imports endorsed by* this Government. Ships are coming into Australia only half loaded with cargo, and men in their thousands are struggling to obtain a day's work on the waterfront. Continuity of employment is impossible for those unfortunate individuals because of the limited quantity of cargo which, owing to the policy of the Government, is available to be handled. The Prime Minister has been approached by the organization and urged to do something to assist these men. But how is this statutory regulation going to solve the problem? How is that modicum of work to be equitably distributed among the hundreds of watersiders who need employment? How is it possible to ration out work that does not exist? </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> knows as well as I do what effect the regulation will have. I do not like to impute motives, but the honorable senator's experience and my own is that when mob rule is allowed, to prevail among starving men, trouble must ensue. These men are all struggling to get the same job and thoughts of their starving wives and families will urge them to desperation. In the bitterness of their feelings what treatment would they mete out to the volunteers were it not for the protection a afforded "by the police ? It is my belief that the Government, in introducing this regulation, knows exactly what effect it will have. The members of the Waterside Workers Federation outnumber the volunteers by five to one, and those unfortunates, with one picking-up place, will be crushed out. A ring of members of the federation will be formed at the picking up place and the volunteers will be sent to the background where the agent engaged in employing men will not be able to see them. If one volunteer forces his way to the front and is fortunate enough to obtain a job, he will probably get a clump on the head and will never again join a gang of unionists. It is no use shutting our eyes to the effects of the regulation. It is my opinion that if it is allowed to operate, members of the federation will oust the volunteers out of their billets and place them in the position of semi-starvation in which many of the unionists find themselves to-day. Both sections must live.- I do not blame the unionist wharf labourer. He cannot help -his present position. But he should have thought of what would be the effect of his action before he took it. I do not want (o crush him or inflict further punishment upon him. .But it is obvious that the work is not there; that too many applicants are available for the waterside work that exists in Australia. Even at peak periods there have been too many men for the work available at the several ports. I have been associated with the industry for very nearly 40 years, and I realize that while a limited number of "star" gangs have made an excellent living, the majority of waterside have eked out a precarious existence. It is customary when other work is .scarce for the unemployed to take out union tickets and rush to the wharfs in an endeavour to get employment there. Instead of introducing this statutory regulation, the Government should have endeavoured to overcome the difficulty in some other way. I remind honorable senators of the expense that is imposed upon Victoria in having to keep on duty squads of police to protect volunteer wharf labourers from the unionists. No one with any knowledge of human psychology would expect the unionists to be other than bitter when they saw the volunteers in employment and themselves idle, with their wives and families almost starving. The Government is merely humbugging the unionists by telling them that it will fight this thing to the bitter end. It is apparent that this regulation is merely the thin edge of the wedge. If by this means the Government succeeds in driving the volunteers off the wharfs at Port Melbourne similar tactics will be employed at the other ports, and in the majority of cases the volunteers will be driven out. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This proposal for one pick-up is deliberately introduced to engineer trouble. Instead of the Government trying to uphold the laws of the country, it is seeking to bring about rioting and other troubles. Honorable senators opposite know that I am not exaggerating the case. I know from experience that I am right. Nobody knows better than Senator Rae the treatment that is meted out to volunteers by unionists. How often a volunteer meets with an unfortunate accident when working down below. How often a sling can go wrong, and some heavy article accidentally fall and injure a volunteer. Some unionists consider that they are justified in adopting such tactics, as the volunteers took their places. They firmly believe that had they not done so their unions would have won the strike. Of course nothing of the kind would have happened. They forget that the wives and families of these volunteers were probably on the verge of starvation, and they were thus driven to take up this work. They became waterside workers because other employment was not available and also to help the country in its moment of trouble. Now a Labour Government, with a considerable majority, comes into power and wants to crush those men out of existence. The whole thing indicates a narrow point of view, and is purely class legislation. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Government in the Senate said that he wanted to see 100 per cent. peace on the waterfront. I have not the slightest doubt that he does, but I do not think that this is the proper method to preserve peace. The regulation is really an insidious attack upon the volunteers - to oust them gradually off the wharfs. I recollect what happened in the early 'nineties, and almost ever since the trouble on the waterfront has been more or less the same. There is more peace at present in the industry than there has been for many years, and all because of the introduction of the Transport Workers Act and the licensing of volunteers. My Queensland colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> yesterday quoted some very illuminating figures showing how handling costs have been reduced by the honest endeavour of volunteers to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. </para>
          <para class="block">Former costs have been reduced by one-half. Obviously that will lessen the cost of production to the community. </para>

              <para>- It is obvious that transport costs will be reduced and that, for instance, the people in North Queensland will pay less for articles transported by sea from Melbourne or Sydney. If the wharf labourers to-day can handle goods at half the cost of handling them previously, it is obvious that other charges also can be reduced. There is efficiency on the waterfront in the north of Queensland to-day because the men are allowed to do a fair day's work. The licensing system enables a foreman to discharge them if they do not give a fair return for their wages. </para>

              <para>- What I have said applies to all the out-ports. While there has been no victimization in applying the licensing system, the system certainly has tended to preserve order. We hear a great deal about the tyranny of the old days. Those days have gone, but to-day we have a tyranny of a different kind. The tyranny of the old days led to efforts which have brought liberty; but that liberty is being misused. The wor.st tyranny to-day is that exercised by the executives of some of the trade unions. There are no greater tyrants  in ' the country than the union vigilance officers. Some of the unions have realized that fact and have endeavoured to get rid of them. This sectional legislation will give power to a small body of men to tyrannize others. If persisted in, it will bring ruin to the Commonwealth, for it will take us hack to the days of mob, -rule. Why has the port of Melbourne been chosen for a test of strength? We heard a great deal yesterday about the conditions at Port Adelaide. Why have not similar tactics been adopted there? Was Melbourne chosen as the battle-ground because a Labour Government is in power in Victoria? </para>

          <para>The licensing system has done much to reduce pillaging in our ports. I do not say that all the members of the Waterside Workers Federation were guilty of pillaging, or that all the losses of cargo were due to pillaging in Australian ports. But I do say that if the volunteer workers are displaced by members of the union, pillaging will increase. I am acquainted with a number ,of prominent public men who at one time were employed on the wharfs. I could entertain the Senate by. recounting some of the stories they have told me regarding what took place on the wharfs when they were employed there. </para>

              <para>- It is well known that a gang of " crooks " associated themselves with the Waterside. Workers Federation, not to carry out legitimate work on the waterfront, but to indulge in pillaging. Their object was the same as that of that body of men who travel from shearing shed to shearing shed, not to engage in the legitimate work of shearing, but to indulge in gambling. Strictly speaking, they have nothing to do with the union. If this regulation is not disallowed, these " crooks " will again be in evidence. For the sake of the wharf labourers themselves, and for the sake of the good name of our Australian ports, we should .see that nothing is done which would give rise to the pillaging which took place in the past. On the grounds that I have mentioned, I shall support the motion for the disallowance of the regulation. </para>

            <para>.- The regulation which forms the basis of this discussion is a small document and appears to be very inoffensive; but when we remember that on every ship which carries inflammable cargo there are notices prohibiting smoking, and that it is an offence to carry a naked light in close proximity to a powder magazine we can not but realize that not to disallow the regulation would be equivalent to applying a match to the inflammable structure on' which Australia at present appears to rest. I shall not follow the lead of those one or two honorable senators whose speeches I listened to ; I shall deal with this regulation from the point of view of its effect on the welfare of the community generally. Not long ago trade in the southern portion of Australia, particularly between Victoria and Tasmania, was dislocated by a hold-up of the shipping services. A similar dislocation occurred each year for about six years previously. But for the last sixteen months there has been a continuous shipping service between Victoria and Tasmania. That happy state of affairs is the direct outcome of the passing of the Transport Workers Act, and the coming into operation of the regulations . made * thereunder . by . the late Government. The wharf labourers themselves are the first .to admit the benefit of that legislation. Numbers of them have told me that since the passing of that act, they have been more continuously employed than for many years previously. When a strike of waterside workers took place about sixteen months ago, a call was made for volunteer workers to take their place. There' was a satisfactory response to that call, and from that time volunteer labourers have worked side by side with - unionists on the wharfs. I do not- agree with those honorable senators who, in supporting the motion before the Senate, have, blamed the waterside workers for all the troubles that have taken place on the waterfront during the last six or seven years. I do not blame the waterside workers at all for what has taken place. I place the blame on those who do not work - the organizers of the waterside workers. </para>

              <para>- When the strike occurred, I had a conversation with  40  or  50  members of the Waterside Workers Union on the wharf in Melbourne. They told me that they were quite content with the conditions previously existing on the waterfront and that they were prepared to obey the awards of the court. But they had not been allowed to do so. They said, moreover, that the views they had expressed were the views of the majority of the members of the union - that quite  80  per cent. of the transport workers did not want to leave their employment. I asked them if the rules of the union did not provide for majority rule and they informed me that if they attended a meeting and freely expressed their views they would be termed " blacklegs " and would be terrorized. I then asked them by whom they would be terrorized. They then informed me that action would be taken by those whose business we know it is to cause industrial strife whenever possible. That is the real position. It has been mentioned in my presence that if this regulation operates there is no doubt as to what will happen. </para>

              <para>- This morning's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> contains the report of an utterance of the Leader of the Government in the Sen ate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to the effect that this regulation had been brought into operation with the idea of bringing the two opposing factions  together. In this connexion I am reminded of an incident which occurred at Glebe where one section came with pickets and the other with bare hands to commence work. The result was a riot in which many men were injured. It is apparent to every one what the result may be if this regulation is not disallowed. The Prime Minister recently stated that he stood for constitutional government. Does he? Will not this regulation, if agreed to, be a distinct contravention of an award of the Arbitration Court? Is not an award of that court the law of the land? Members of the present Ministry have appeared on public platforms and distinctly stated that an award of the Arbitration Court is not the law of the land, and have openly urged workers to defy an award of the court. How can we reconcile such statements with the statement of the Prime Minister that he stands for constitutional government? I intend to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> for the disallowance of the regulation. </para>

              <para>- It is easy for such honorable senators to say that they are just as good labour men to-day as they were when they were members of the party to which I belong. I know exactly where I stand in regard to this proposal and I have no hesitation in saying that my heart goes out to the working men of this country who have done so much to bring about the conditions which many are now able to enjoy. I intend to stand or fall by that policy and God forbid the day should ever come when I shall turn down those whose claims I should always advocate. One important aspect of this subject  has  been deliberately or unintentionally overlooked by honorable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> referred to a statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> who said that he believed in constitutional  government. There is no need for me to refer to the last general election, but it should be apparent to every one that the present Government was returned upon a definite platform, one of the main planks of which is the retention of our present arbitration system. The subject of arbitration is closely associated with this matter. In the first place a section of the. men at present employed on the waterfront known as loyalists, volunteers, scabs, free labourers or whatever term may be applied to them are not. covered by any award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I do not know if. the employers by whom they are engaged will take advantage of this position, but there is always the grave danger of them doing <inline font-style="italic">so.</inline> Under the existing conditions it is impossible to ascertain whether the employers by whom these men are engaged are paying the wages provided in the award. The regulation provides that those seeking work on the waterfront shall be engaged at the one pick-up. I have been informed on good authority that a person in Brisbane employing waterside workers owns the property on which the men he employs are picked up and consequently only those whom he wishes to engage are permitted to enter his property. </para>

              <para>- But the principle is the same. The honorable senator gave us a lot of trash that had very little to do with the subject. It is quite possible that conditions similar to those in Brisbane obtain in Melbourne. I am satisfied that at present the ship-owners and shipping companies discriminate between members of the Waterside Workers Federation and volunteers. Honorable senators opposite contend that such discrimination is justified because the volunteers came to the rescue of the shipowners. </para>

              <para>- The people who came to the rescue of Australia are the unionists who built 'up the conditions which the people are enjoying to-day. I do not desire to traverse in detail the dispute which led up to the introduction of the Transport Workers Bill as that has very little bearing on the subject. The question we have to consider is whether the employment on the waterfront now offering is being equally distributed among the men who are seeking it. I am advocating that the men who are entitled to the work should have a fair chance of getting it. </para>

              <para>-Although that has nothing to do with the subject under discussion, I may say that I appreciate all that was done by our soldiers, and 1 suppose I have made as many sacrifices in connexion with the war as the honorable senator who interjected. The soldier who deserves the most credit is the one who does not parade or trade on his service. During the war period the working class of this and other countries were granted increases in wages because the employers did not desire any cessation of operations. As a consequence the conditions of employment were improved and rates of wages were increased. </para>

              <para>- I am not contending that the position of the workers was bettered. Shortly after the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (now</inline> Judge) Beeby visited America and upon his return declared that if the world was to be safer for democracy, the hours of labour would have to be reduced. I believe he was the first to raise this issue and a few years later the principle of 44 hours was observed in certain Arbitration Court awards. On the waterfront, as I have already stated, the conditions of the waterside workers were improved, but since the war there has been a deliberate attempt to reduce wages. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether they are or are not ; but I do know that if the employers or ship-owners decided tomorrow that they would not pay the award rate, there is no law to compel them to do so. It is advisable, therefore, that the claims of the Waterside Workers Federation should be recognized, so that the workers can be sure that they are being paid wages to which they are legally entitled. The granting of preference will mean protection to all persons employed on the waterfront. If the shipping companies got the upper hand no one doubts that, when it suited their purpose, they would pay volunteer workers whatever rate they chose to give and the workers would have no protection unless they were associated with the federation. The Prime Minister was quite right when he said that the Government stood for the observance of law and order. That end would be attained by the action taken by the Government. The principle of preference is embodied in this regulation, and I hope that it will be allowed to stand. </para>

          <para>I have been associated with the trade union movement all my life and I have no fear for the future. I know that, in the main, trade unionists are a good class of men. Of the total number who enlisted for the war, 90 per cent., at least, were members of some trade union organization. They proved themselves men on the other side and they will continue to act as men in the pursuit of their peaceful avocations in this country. Every man with spirit will stand up for what he believes to be his right. Surely honorable senators opposite will not condemn men for having the courage of their convictions. Every man worthy of the name seeks to make his conditions and the conditions of his fellow workers better than he found them. I trust that those honorable senators who have so severely criticized the waterside workers will concede that at least they are human, and. should not be condemned for doing what to them appears to be the right thing. </para>

            <para>- I am. amazed at the inconsistency of this Government. Although Ministers profess to be staunch supporters of the  principle of arbitration, the statutory rule now under discussion was framed with the deliberate intention of overriding the decision of the Arbitration Court. It seems to me that the whole issue is <inline font-style="italic">subjudice</inline> because when the regulations were under consideration an application was before the Arbitration Court for absolute preference to unionists. Judge Beeby refused the application because the members of the Waterside Workers Federation had so frequently defied the award of the court. Ho also declined to disturb the existing arrangement with regard to the pick-up places. All honorable senators who claim to be upholders of law and order and of the principle of arbitration, must realize that the waterside workers have been flagrantly and violently disobedient to the court. Without reference to Parliament, this Government is attempting to override an Arbitration Court decision by promulgating new regulations under the Transport Workers Act. The intention, of course, is to strike a Wow at that loyal band of volunteer labourers who came to the assistance of their country when the waterside workers openly flouted the Arbitration Court by refusing to load produce for export or unload commodities necessary for the people of Australia. These men disobeyed the law, just as, during the war, they defied the la.w and refused to load Bed Cross comforts and Christmas billies for " diggers " at the front. Honorable senators who are supporting the Government do not like to-be reminded of the attitude of the waterside workers during the war. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>An attempt is now being made to drive these volunteer workers into . the ranks of the law-breakers. If this movement is successful, the lot of the volunteer workers will be most unenviable. At a time when members of the Waterside Workers Federation refused to work, these men accepted the good wages then offering, and by their industry have got together comfortable homes for their wives and children. They should not now be compelled to assemble at a common pick-up place with thousands of unionists, who, we know, will at once attempt to bludgeon them into submission. We do not forget what happened on the waterfront at the port of Melbourne. During the height of the dispute, it was not an uncommon spectacle to see hundreds of unionists attacking one or two free labourers. On one occasion they actually threw a free labourer in front of a moving train. They pursued these unfortunate men into their homes, and even harassed the children of volunteer workers in the schools, and endeavoured, by every means in their power to make the lives of all connected with them a hell upon earth. And they are still doing it.* Fortunately, Judge Beeby, in his wisdom, refused to grant preference in employment to members of the federation. Volunteer workers are still permitted to. enjoy the good conditions of employment available and high wages offering to men who are willing to obey the laws of their country. I do not suggest, of course, that all unionists are undesirable characters. Many thousands of them are reputable citizens, but, unhappily for them, they have been misled, and in certain circumstances, are unable to help themselves. They are in much- the same position as the timber-workers as the result of their ill-advised and ill-considered strike. Their secretary may be in Parliament to-day, but where are they to-day? The coal-miners of New South Wales also have been misled and arc in a desperate position to-day. Those foolish men declined to work for rates of pay under which it was possible to earn anything from  £10  to  £18 a  week. They spurned the opportunity. Now they are begging for assistance, and their wives' and children are suffering great privations. Instead of being commended for bravery, men who disobey . the laws of their country and turned aside from opportunities to work should be regarded as cowards. Members of the Waterside Workers Federation are now in distressful circumstances. I  am  particularly sorry for the members of the Port Philip Stevedoring Association, an organization of efficient returned soldiers. It is to be regretted that, against their better judgment, they were dragooned into striking. Had they stood out against the move then made to dislocate the industry on the waterfront, their lives would have been endangered and the lives of their women and children have been rendered almost unendurable. These men very much regret the action which they took. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> very wisely said the other day that there should be no time for loafers or sweaters in this young country. With that sentiment I agree entirely. We have legislated against the sweater, but apparently it is difficult to enforce the law against the loafer and therefore we cannot safeguard adequately the interests of the consumer. The loafer, by strike methods, is responsible to a great extent for increasing the cost of everything required by the consumer. I am wondering if this Government and its supporters will have the courage to bring pressure to bear upon the waterside workers and the coal-miners to give up striking and get to work. </para>

              <para>- I am very sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I shall endeavour to apply my remarks more directly to the motion to . disallow this statutory rule. I was merely making a comparison between the position of our wheatgrowers and that of waterside workers who jeopardized some time ago the interests of many primary producers by refusing to load our surplus products for export. I honestly believe that the Government has been impelled by outside forces to take this action. It is repeating the mistake which it made when it withdrew the preference in employment to returned soldiers. In its attempt to force all workers into trade union organizations, I believe the Government is taking instructions from extremists ' in the Labour movement. If this regulation stands, it will simply mean mob rule on the waterfront, with the extremist element persecuting, terrorizing, and starving the loyalists, They will make life impossible for men whose only sin is that they have accepted the high wages prevailing in Australia for doing honest work that is available . to them. It is to them a rich reward compared with what could possibly be earned by them in other countries. If this extremist body, the Waterside Workers Federation, once more secures power on the waterfront, it will not be long before Ave  have further strikes. Providence has been very good to Australia lately, and as the result of a bountiful rainfall  Ave  shall have a great deal of produce to export, but if effect is given to this statutory rule, there  Wl  only be sore heads and empty pockets for loyalist workers, who have given us peace and efficiency on the waterfront </para>

We have had strikes year after year, holding up the export of our produce, and we have even been denied reasonable communication with Tasmania. Almost always at the height of the tourist season, upon which Tasmania relies so much, we have had strikes and terrorism. We have known mob rule.

              <para>- I am showing that if effect is given to this regulation, and loyalists are forced to assemble with an overwhelming number of strikers on a common pick-up ground, we shall have chaos, and probably bloodshed, on the waterfront. To my mind, it will be a calamity to have any departure from the present peaceful conditions. It is the duty of this Parliament to afford protection to the volunteer workers. Honorable senators know that even if volunteers are anxious to become members of the Waterside Workers Federation, it is almost as difficult and as costly for them to do so as it is to join an exclusive club. The initiation fee is very heavy, and there is no certainty, if they are admitted as members, that they will get their fair share of the work that is going unless they become very friendly with the officials of the union. I have a tremendous admiration and liking for those who work, but I have no time for shirkers and pilferers. The Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation contains a very serious proportion of men with criminal records. Some of them have had as many as ten convictions against them. We do not want men of that sort handling the produce of Australia. We know very well that the rifeness cf pilfering in our ports had earned for Australia an unenviable reputation, but since the volunteers have been handling cargoes, not only has the work been done more speedily ; there has been practically no pilfering. </para>

            <para>. -  It is rather unprecedented in the history of this Parliament that a day and a half of. the valuable time of the Senate should be spent in the discussion of a motion such as this, but the time has been well spent if it directs attention to 'a problem which has lately assumed rather big proportions, and of which this waterside workers regulation pretends to be a solution. I was waiting for Ministers to display some feelings of regret or contrition for the action of the Government, but beyond a respectful silence, which is usually a very wholesome prelude to a change of heart, nothing has come from them by way of indicating that they are sorry for what they have done. We can only hope that time will prove to them, if the barrage of solid facts and arguments cannot do it, that at least they have made a serious mistake. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposal of the Government seems ' to be an attempt to override an award of the Arbitration Court. ' This has "never been done before. It is obligatory on us as senators, with responsibilities to our constituents, to see that the action of the Government responds to at least three tests : whether ii is expedient or politic; whether it is equitable, and whether it is just to the people as a whole. Applying the first test, whether it is expedient or politic, J fail to see how it can possibly be so, because in the first place it is only of geographical significance. The regulation i° not proposed to be applied to the whole area of this continent. It has' been specifically framed to apply to one port' in the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth. Even if the Senate were foolish enough not to exercise the prerogative it enjoys in respect of ordinances and regulations, and permitted this promulgated regulation to operate in a circumscribed area in Victoria, it would naturally follow, as night follows day, that other areas not so smiled upon by the present Government, would immediately consider that they had a grievance and appeal to the Government to be treated in the same way. I cannot imagine members of the union in Queensland, Western Australia, or anywhere else outside Victoria remaining quiescent when they see that a small part of Victoria has been singled out- for special federal legislation, while they have been left out in the cold. Therefore, on the ground of expediency alone, which,  afte  all is said and done, is a 'characteristic of legislation, although it should not be, the action of the Government in promulgating this regulation stands condemned because it is the beginning of a pack of trouble for the Government. </para>
          <para>Applying the next test - whether the regulation is equitable or not - we find that the people who have succeeded in getting the ear of the Government have got it for one reason only. They have proved themselves to be more bellicose, more unmanageable, more fractious, and more disobedient to the law than any other section in Australia ; and they have been rewarded for disobeying the law by the smashing of an award of the Arbitration Court into smithereens. Have we come to that pass in Australia that we are to pass special legislation for the purpose of favouring those who, instead of obeying the law, have disobeyed it? It is a sorry outlook for this country if all that a person needs to do in future is to have a  malignant  intent to break the law .and he will be -rewarded by the Government. I am sure Ministers have not studied that aspect of the question. When they took the first step they could not have realized what the next step must necessarily be. So much for the lack of equity in this proposal. </para>
          <para>Now as to its justice to the community. I take it that, 'after all, the community has some small claim to have its just grievances remedied, and is entitled to protest against injustices being inflicted upon it. Let me apply that standard to this regulation. What has the Government done? Honorable senators well know what it has done, by presuming to introduce this regulation. I remember that years ago, when I worked among the wharf labourers, you could not organize them for love or money. You could not get them to strike even to remedy a legitimate grievance. Now you cannot stop them from striking on the slightest pretext. Do their strikes help society? They do not; they wound it vitally, as every honorable senator opposite would admit if he dared give expression to his honest opinion. I have seen perishable goods piled up on our wharfs in different States, rotting away because these men were on holiday or in conference, or flouting the law  of the  land. I have seen the , juice trickling away from cases 'of beautiful fruit, which these men refused to load. In consequence the hard work of the primary producers of Australia was rendered useless. If such a state of affairs is to continue we may as well get one of the old-time battering rams and knock our Arbitration Court out of existence altogether. Many of the awards of Judge Beeby and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, two of the best friends that the workers of Australia ever had, were trampled in the dust by the Waterside Workers Federation. We have now arrived at the cross-roads, and must decide the direction in which we shall travel in future. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this regulation is merely to condone the action of those who have been guilty of law-breaking; of those who have caused endless monetary loss to Australia. A miserable handful of men have taken it upon themselves to defy the laws, and to render futile the labour of our producers. The Government proposes to establish one central picking-up place, where all applicants for waterside labour shall congregate. I point to the inconsistency of the Government's attitude. Do they make any provision for one pick-up for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> miners of Kalgoorlie? No. Those miners have to attend early in the morning, at the change of shifts, and again at night, to apply for work, but the Government has no word or action for them. It thinks only of this boisterous and law-breaking remnant, who have done so much to injure the country. Had those miners, for whom the Govern.ment has no sympathy, indulged in tactics similar to those employed by the watersiders, they would have closed every goldmine in Australia. Instead, they stuck loyally by the law of the land.. and assisted Australia in its time of travail. The cherished ideals of the Labour party are liberty, equality, and fraternity. This regulation violates every one of those ideals. It is merely bestowing favoritism on the curly-headed darling of the family. I do not say that I have no sympathy for the watersiders. By criticizing the wrong actions of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, I prove that I am a better friend to them than this ill-advised Government.  Claiming to be socialists, they have been guilty of unsocial practices by holding up the commerce of the country and allowing valuable produce to become destroyed, when it should have been on the high seas, bound for a waiting market. </para>
          <para>The Government wants both parties the members of the Waterside Workers Federation and the volunteers - to congregate at Hogan's Flat. He would be a flat indeed who went there without a union ticket, and without being a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. I should rather call it " Hogan's Trap." The rules of combat there would be six unionists, armed with bottles on bricks, against one poor, unfortunate volunteer. The unionists would endeavour to "persuade" the volunteer to their line of thought, in their own "playful " fashion. Is that fair play? I am confident that the people of Australia will not stand for that sort of thing. Honorable  senators  opposite, and their supporters, call these volunteers, scabs, disloyalists, and all sorts of other unpleasant names. .1 call them patriots, men who have upheld 'the law of the land. I leave those ugly terms on one side. My conclusion on the point is that disloyalty or scabbing is all a matter of either chronology or geography, time or place. When, during the coal strike, Australian miners refused to work for £2 a day, and coal was imported from Great Britain, the miners of that country </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline>were not called scabs. And similar remarks apply to the recent timber strike. But when unionism steps out, attempts to take the welfare of the community into its own hands, and plays fast and loose with the common weal, it needs to be put into its proper place, as was done during the French Revolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> knows very well that during those troublous times, when the proletariats were on top, care was taken that trade unionism should not usurp the functions of the Committee of Public Safety. </para>
          <para>I shall read a statement by a Frenchman, who has some very interesting observations to make on the manner in which some sections of trade unionism are seeking to usurp the rights of the community in Australia.

            <para>. -  If there is one thing more than another which this long debate has indicated, it is the vindictive and undying hatred, which most honorable senators opposite still cherish towards trade unionism, despite their frequent disclaimers. Whenever unionism is mentioned ; whenever it attempts to better the conditions of the workers, it is denounced and derided by them; whenever it suffers, a setback there is jubilation in the ranks of the Opposition. If. they could wipe out unionism to-morrow, they would reach the summit of their bliss.. It appears strange - but perhaps, after all it is not strange - that those whose hatred of unionism is greatest, are those honorable senators who at one time were among the shining lights of the Labour movement, but now, having deserted their onetime principles, they are constantly endeavouring to malign those who stuck to their principles. The most vicious, the most anti-social, the most lopsided view of unionism is exhibited by those honorable senators of whom the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is the chief exponent. </para>

              <para>- I shall have to bow to the standing orders, however lopsided they may be. I admit that the character of Judge Beeby is not now in question; but I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> went out of his way to eulogize that gentleman, or to speak so highly of his qualifications. The point is that Judge Beeby, however able he may be, entirely misconstrued the true functions of trade unionism in alleging all those faults against the members of the Waterside Workers Federation. Every organization has its objectionable characteristics. I do not deny that undesirable men may be in the ranks of the Waterside Workers Federation; but there are equally objectionable men in the ranks of other organizations, not even excepting those black coated gentlemen who are never characterized as loafers, yet are the chief sinners under that heading. If we are to condemn an organization as a whole because a criminal element attempts to use it to serve their own ends, then we must condemn even the churches, and indeed, every institution in the land; for in every institution there are men who seek to use it to their own advantage. Apart from those few undesirable men who may be in the ranks of the Waterside Workers Federation, the waterside workers of Australia are one of the finest bodies of men in the world. They have done more by their fighting attitude to gain advantages for their fellow workers than almost any other branch of workers, with the possible exception of the coalminers, has done. Thathonorable senators opposite oppose the militant attitude of the unions is evidence that they object to unionism itself, for without militancy there would have been no unionism. </para>

              <para>- There must be a limit to everything, but just what that 'limit should be depends on time and circumstances, It cannot be set down in hard and fast terms. Many of the things which Judge Beeby alleged against these men were actions which they, as a result of their experience, found to be absolutely necessary if. they were to defend the rights so hardly won. Unless unionists are prepared to fight for the maintenance of the rights they have won, and to make them a stepping stone to higher things, unionism must be destroyed. It is only the fighting spirit behind unionism that has made unionism possible. Only because unionism persisted in defiance of the law which prevented it, was it able to grow until even the legislature of Great Britain was compelled to recognize what it had formerly proscribed. I say, further, that most of the charges alleged against the wharf labourers are to their infinite credit. I glory in the fact that they have been ready to resent pin pricks, and that whenever they have been hit, they have hit back. A good deal has been said about produce being left to rot on the wharf. For seven years, I was engaged in fruit-growing in New South Wales, but never once was any of my fruit held up. Does that not show that the holding up of perishable produce was indeed a rare occurrence? </para>

              <para>- Even so, it is more than probable that it had to be transported by ship to Melbourne - whether a man is a direct or an indirect shipper is immaterial. Certain happenings have been grossly exaggerated in order to throw mud at the wharf labourers. Honorable senators opposite say that there are a great many more unionists than there are so-called volunteers, and the preponderance of unionists must inevitably lead to a clash between, the two bodies of men, resulting in the volunteers being driven from their work, and possibly ruined. If present conditions are allowed to continue, honorable senators will find that all the alleged brutality and unscrupulousness of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation will before long be the attributes of the/ volunteers. Human nature is very much the same everywhere. If a monopoly of work on .the waterfront has led to a growth of tyranny among unionists, then I say that to give the volunteers a monopoly of that work would be to encourage in them exactly the same characteristics. If, on the other hand, this regulation is allowed to remain in operation it will result in the men meeting' each other, when they will inevitably learn that their interests are in common. It suited one crowd to jump in, not for the sake of that stupid idea of protecting their country, but to get a job which they previously could not obtain. They thought it was a grand thing to be in employment when they had been out of work for some time. </para>

              <para>- That is not the point with which I am dealing. These men rushed in to get a job and owing to the rotten state of our social system there is not- work for all. One can get employment only at the expense of the other. In course of time these volunteers will inevitably be subjected to the tyranny and pin-pricks and attacks which have been objected to by the members of the federation. Instead of fighting against each other they should pull together in order to maintain whatever advantages they now enjoy. Honorable senators opposite seem to think that the police alone are ensuring peace on the waterfront. This regulation has been in operation nearly a month and no difficulty has arisen. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable senator is referring to two incidents in one dispute. . It has frequently been stated during the debate that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation have for years been keeping the country in a perpetual state of turmoil, causing the destruction of property and generally acting in a manner detrimental to the community. That is a wholesale charge, made in a spirit of vindictiveness, and so grossly exaggerated that I venture to suggest that an impartial listener to the debate would say that the sole desire of honorable senators opposite is to defeat trade unionism. Those who had deserted' their' Labour principles are foremost in attacking those with whom they were once associated. It has been said that the people in Victoria, whom this regulation primarily affects, are in no worse position than they were under the old system. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> who said that the same amount of money is in circulation. We can get a little beyond such simplicity. The dislocation of an industry seriously affects the particular locality in which it is established; but that dislocation differs in a marked degree from the gradual growth or failure of an industry when people can adjust themselves to the changing conditions.

            <para>The deputation asked the Premier to use his influence with the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. \V. T.

            <para>Cr. J. P. Crichton said that 130 local families wore being assisted by the Benevolent Society. The business people had been standing up to the unemployed for months, but they could not afford to do so any longer. "We have many loyal men who fought for the Umpire," he went on, "and they lost their employment owing to striking. A mistake was made, but mistakes can generally be rectified. In their case, however, there seems no chance of it." </para>

          <para class="block">Honorable senators who so freely speak of the men who served their country and who, during the war and since, pose as patriots and loyalists, must admit that hundreds of these men who have been prevented from obtaining work, served the Empire in a manner which they laud to the skies when it .suits them, and totally ignore on other occasions. The paragraph continues - " In the place of these men are aliens receiving wages, and the money is going out of the country. The council is doing all it can, and will spend £35,000 on road construction. That will employ 30 extra men." </para>

          <para>. - In the case of amalgamations or mergers of life insurance companies, it seems to me that actuarial examinations should take place in the interest of the policy-holders or share-holders of the companies proposing to amalgamate or merge. If such examinations are made mandatory, and not subject to a direction by a court, the persons concerned in the amalgamating companies will have some assurance of the bona fides of the proposed transactions. If the companies concerned were small and insignificant the expense involved would not be very great; but if there is a good deal at stake the cost feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> would be amply justified, because of the safeguard it would give to the share-holders or policy-holders. </para>

          <para>.  - My anxiety is for the interests of the policy-holder, who in most cases is the share-holder in life insurance companies. I think that the Mutual Life is the only Australian company with actual share-holders. No transfer or merger should be approved without the consent of the share-holders and policyholders. It has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that it would be a difficult matter to communicate with all the policy-holders of a big life insurance company, and impracticable to secure their views; but there seems to be no difficulty in issuing bonus declarations to policy-holders of big companies, or in sending out notices to them when directors are to be elected. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> can assure me that the interests of the policy-holders will be protected without the amendment suggested, and that the policy-holders will be given every opportunity to study any proposed scheme of amalgamation before it is finally confirmed, I shall be satisfied ; but I suggest that the interests of these people are paramount to any court procedure. The policy-holders are the owners of these companies, and should be consulted in the first instance in regard to any proposed amalgamation. </para>

But I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> raising objection, because he represents a State in which no such protection is afforded by life insurance legislation.

The vendor company has to submit an actuarial valuation to the purchasing company, and the latter has to get its actuaries to check that valuation. It  is  the duty of the court to see that the company accepting the liability has a statutory fund sufficient to meet, not only its own obligations, but also those  it  is likely to incur under any scheme of amalgamation. It will be seen that the whole scheme is submitted to the court.

            <para>- Surely the honorable senator misses the point. The published notification is very widely promulgated, and if a party is affected in any shape or form he may make application to be heard in the matter, either by himself or with the assistance of a solicitor or counsel. I put it to honorable senators that we do not want to embarrass honest people. I have known cases where, under State legislation, that power has been used by people who have harbored extraordinary views regarding the liabilities of insurance companies. The judge was ultimately satisfied as  to  the good faith of the companies, but he awarded those misguided persons the costs that were occasioned by the application. Speaking from some experience of this branch of legislation, I think that honorable senators may well accept the clause which has been carefully drafted, and is modelled entirely on State legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> amendment practically provides that the work shall  be  done twice. That should be at the discretion of the judge, and we have given him that discretion. I cannot accept the amendment, because I feel that it would impose an unnecessary burden on insurance companies. The primary duty of the judge in relation to an amalgamation is to act as a sort of judicial trustee on behalf of the  policy-holders  whose interests are involved in the transaction. I submit that those interests are adequately protected by the clause as  it  stands. </para>

Subclause 2 provides that where the net liability of the company is less than £20,000, it shall deposit with the Treasurer money or approved securities equal to its net liability, but in no case of a value less than £2,000. Sub-clause 3 makes provision for the building up of the amount of the deposit by at least £2,000 per annum until it reaches £20,000. There is then the safeguarding provision in sub-clause 4 - that the Treasurer shall not accept a deposit, or any sum on account of a deposit, except on a warrant of the Registrar, and also that the Registrar shall not arbitrarily refuse any application for a warrant. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HAL</inline>COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [9.45.] - I ask the honorable senator in charge of the bill whether it is not possible to avoid using the word " foreign ". I do not like it to go out to the world that this Parliament has passed an act which classes British companies as "foreign." I am not opposed to the underlying principle of the clause or to the proposal that we should require a higher deposit from a company which has its head office, say, in London, than from one with its head office in Australia, but I think it is unfortunate to provide that a British company is a foreign company. </para>

          <para>- The six existing State life insurance acts refer to companies whose head offices are outside Australia as foreign companies, and in this measure similar language is used. I must oppose the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> because although it may be quite true that a good deal of money goes out of the country for reinsurance purposes, the State Life Insurance Company of Queensland effects its reinsurances, not with the insurance companies trading in Australia, but by treaties with so-called foreign companies in London. It is preferable to have companies operating in Australia than to send money overseas in the form of treaties. A certain element of preference is given to local companies in that there is a safeguarding clause under which they can in the first place deposit £2,000. We wish to assist the expansion of local companies by enabling them to contribute their deposits in a piecemeal manner, whereas foreign companies are compelled to deposit the whole sum of £20,000 at once. I suggest that the honorable senator allow the clause to pass in its present form as it is more in keeping with the principle which he supports. It is better to keep the money in Australia than to send it overseas. </para>

Provision could be made for a deposit of £25,000 by companies operating within the Empire and of £30,000 for what are essentially foreign companies. " Foreign " is an unfortunate term to apply to anything within the Empire, and if the amendment is amended in the direction I have suggested, I shall be inclined to support it. </para>

            <para>- Under clause 27 Australian companies are not being asked to pay more than foreign companies. A Commonwealth company proposing to carry on insurance business after the commencement of this measure will be allowed to lodge the deposit of £20,000 at the rate of £2,000 per annum. I do not think that in the matter of instalments there is any difference between clauses 24 and 27. I am quite agreeable to support the proposition if the principle is conceded that we should give preference to Australian companies. The whole of the assets of Australian companies are available for the protection of policy-holders, but in the case of proprietary companies whose head offices are abroad, the local policy-holders are protected only to the amount of the deposit. Numerous difficulties would arise if, when a foreign company failed, the dividend available had to be collected in Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> who is in charge of this measure, should not be obsessed with the idea that it is perf ect in every respect, but should accept an amendment in accordance with the settled policy  of  the country. Every penny of insurance money which goes outside the country, may be regarded as tribute to outside interests. If we could not conduct the business ourselves, it would be a different matter; but Australian life insurance companies have been effectively operating for many years, and we should not place further burdens upon the people by inducing foreign companies to come to Australia. </para>

The necessary amendment could then be made in the definition clause in order to make a distinction between British and foreign companies. I do not think that the obligation placed upon British companies should be higher than is suggested here. </para>

            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> carried his argument to its logical conclusion, he should be agreeable to strike out the clause altogether. It is futile to say that there are no companies other than British or Australian companies carrying on business in Australia; this clause has no application to companies now carrying on business in Australia. I do not like the idea of referring to British companies as foreign companies and then to penalize British companies. I am entirely in sympathy with the suggestion that a foreign company wishing to commence business here should be required to make a very substantial deposit. There is more than a sentimental reason behind my suggestion. Some 35 years ago the Equitable Life Insurance Company of New York - a foreign company - commenced operations here, did a large insurance business and ultimately let down the people who had put money into it. The same thing might happen again. It is more difficult to safeguard the interests of investors in a foreign company than those of investors in an Australian or British company. I think it is worth while considering whether it is not practicable to make some differentiation between British and foreign companies. </para>

Under section 24 a deposit of £20,000 has to be paid irrespective of the number of classes of life insurance business which are being carried on, but under clause 26, which relates to companies which may commence operations after the commencement of the act, a distinction is drawn between such companies and what is, in ordinary parlance, a foreign company. We provide in it that with respect to each class of life insurance business carried on a deposit of £20,000 shall be lodged, thus providing  a  substantial preference. </para>

            <para>- To the ordinary lay mind that would appear to be the case, I confess that I had considerable difficulty in deciding whether or not to insert the proviso, but the actuaries tell me it is advisable to have it for the purpose of safeguarding the statutory funds. It will give the provision a little more elasticity. As it is the desire of those who are familiar with the working of this class of business to have the proviso inserted, I offer no objection to it, The suggestion comes from a very able man who, I understand, has communicated with the departmental heads in relation to the matter. With the proviso inserted, the companies working under the law will be allowed a little more elasticity. </para>

          <para>. - There is a subtle distinction from a legal point of view between clause 38 and clause 42. The former imposes upon the directors of an insurance company the responsibilities of trustees and the law is well defined on the responsibility of trustees. In clause 42 liability in respect to misfeasance in relation to statutory funds is clearly defined. Any officer of a company shall be deemed to have been guilty of misfeasance unless he proves that the contravention occurred without his consent or connivance and was not facilitated by any neglect on his part. Safeguarding provisions are necessary in clause 42 under which the trustee law will not operate, but there is no occasion to insert those provisions in clause 38, because in that case the ordinary trustee law affords the necessary protection. </para>

It is admitted that during the last 30 years there has been an improvement of twelve years in the expectation of life. It is obviously unfair that premiums based on a shorter expectation of life are much higher than they ought to be, but I do not know how we can protect policy-holders in that respect.

I have heard a number of insured people comment on the subject. I consider my life is good enough to carry a premium equal to only half of what I pay. Undoubtedly the expectation of life is very different now from what it was 30 or 40 years ago. Improvements in sanitation, hygiene, surgery and so on have gone a long way towards lengthening the average span of human life, and policy-holders should receive some benefit. It is an entirely reasonable thing to ask that the actual assessment of expectancy of life should be brought up-to-date, and if there is any benefit accruing to the policy-holders it should be conferred on them. I think that entirely unnecessary overhead expenses are paid as directors' fees and so forth, and that we are. being mulcted for the benefit of the companies. </para>

Surely the whole essence of insurance is provision for the future ! If in this single matter of life insurance we make a little more provision for the future than is necessary, that may, to some extent, offset the many directions in which we are piling up burdens against posterity. I do not think we need to worry a great deal about the matter. There are other considerations. Certain life insurance companies, because of the risk they took during the war, incurred losses which will for a considerable period counteract the advantages of any increased longevity. It has also to be remembered that it is always open to the insurer to insure in a purely mutual company. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HAL</inline>COLEBATCH.No, actually. No person gets any private profit out of them. Anything in excess of premiums is paid as bonuses. It may be that such companies carry over to the future a little more than is absolutely necessary, but need we quarrel over that ? What is wrong with it ? The bonuses now paid by such companies are very high and of actual value to the insurer and to those in whose interests he is insured. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HAL</inline>COLEBATCH.Surely life insurance policies are taken out chiefly in the interests of one's dependants. It must also be remembered that there is very keen competition for business amongst life insurance companies. I do not think we need to worry ourselves with the idea that we are making too much provision for the future. In some respects we in Australia are apt to pile up a burden on posterity rather than to make provision for it. What does it matter if premiums are slightly higher than seems absolutely necessary so long as we obtain a corresponding benefit in the form of bonuses? After all a mutual company is governed by the directors that the policy-holders choose to elect. If the policyholders are not satisfied with the policy of the concern ; if they desire to cut down premiums and increase bonuses, the matter is entirely in their hands. While I admit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson's</inline> contention, I should be very loth indeed to include in an act of Parliament a provision which arbitrarily compelled a company to make a lesser provision against the future than its directors considered to be necessary. </para>

            <para>- I am not in favour of passing burdens on to posterity. I think that those who shelter themselves from a charge of extravagance under the pretence that what they are providing for posterity should be paid for by posterity indulge in a false and narrow-minded hypothesis. We are to a certain extent wasting assets that would otherwise go to posterity, and  Ave  should not grudge any benefits that may go to our successors through other channels. </para>

        <para>The point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch's</inline> customary logic missed was that, although these benefits in the shape of bonuses may go to posterity, it is a very serious thing if, because of heavy premiums, people have to forfeit their policies. It is not sufficient to say that because a company over-charges the beneficiaries under one's will will reap an advantage. If, because of restricted finance, a person is unable to pay his high premiums, posterity will suffer. Again, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> is a very trusting man - far too trusting for one with his business experience - to assert seriously that no gain is obtained from so-called mutual companies other than by policy-holders. As a matter of fact, the supposed democratic constitution of these mutual companies which provides that policy-holders elect directors, and the directors appoint the managers, is, to put it colloquially, all " bunkum." Nominally, policy-holders have that power, but they are scattered all over the country and it is impossible to organize them into concerted action. In most cases the board of directors is a happy family, and they select one another. Everything is arranged before the annual general meeting takes place and any vacancies occurring in the interim are filled by the surviving directors. Those people pay themselves what they like as fees, and even those companies which are credited with the greatest halo of sanctity are, in this respect, big swindling concerns that exploit their policy-holders. </para>

          <para>. -  Sub-clause 2 fixes the time when the policy is sent out. If nothing happens to cause it to go astray, the person to whom it is addressed is deemed to have received it. The position is entirely different from that which arises when  a  person returns  a  policy  to  which he objects. It would scarcely be fair that a company should be required to refund any premium paid, merely on the man's statement that he posted tha policy to the company. Sub-clause 3 has purposely been made more rigid than sub-clause 2 in order to protect the company. Thousands of policies may be issued each year by a company. They arc posted by officers of the company as part of their ordinary work. But when a person to whom a policy is issued objects to its terms something in the nature of an extraordinary happening takes place, and greater precautions are necessary. </para>

          <para>. - We should insist on policies being registered both ways. Should a policy sent out by a company be lost in the post, the person to whom it was issued might be required to make an affidavit before a Justice of the Peace that he did not receive it. The same principle should apply to the company as to the policyholder. The policy does not become any more valuable because an objection is raised to it, and there is, therefore, no greater justification for registering it when it is returned to the company than when it is sent out by the company. </para>

          <para>. - All well-managed insurance companies keep a record of letters and policies posted. The only reason for a company saying that it sent out a policy when it did not do so would be that it anticipated an objection being raised by the person to whom it was issued. I do not think that any more is required of a company than that it should prove that it posted the policy. </para>

It must be remembered that the right to a refund of any premium paid is something which policy-holders have never previously had.

It  does not meet the case now under consideration. Before a policy-holder can exercise the right, given to him by clause 59 (1) he must see the policy; otherwise he cannot say whether it contains any objectionable condition. In the case I have mentioned, should it not reach the policyholder until the 23rd May, and he then finds that it contains an objectionable provision, it is too late for him to claim a refund of any premium paid. The additional cost of registering the letter is not very great. </para>

If an industrial policy-holder wishes to object to any of the conditions in his policy he has the right to do so within  21  days, and in practice  I  think this provision will not inflict hardships upon any one. If the companies were compelled to register every industrial policy despatched by post a tremendous expense and an unnecessary amount of office work would be involved. </para>

          <para>. -  I regret that on this occasion I should have to part company with my old and esteemed colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> If we were to compel insurance companies to register industrial policies registration would not be a. better safeguard than the record of despatch kept in the company's office. When a premium is paid on an industrial policy the person insured anticipates the receipt of a policy. The insured person who pays the premium knows that the policy is to be posted, and that within the prescribed period of  21  days following its receipt he has the right to lodge an objection. A policy-holder would naturally be expecting the policy and if it did not arrive within a reasonable time his natural inclination would be to make some inquiries. The registration of such a document would not provide any additional security. Many industrial policies are taken out for small amounts, and if companies were compelled to register the hundreds of thousands of industrial policies which they handle it would mean placing an unnecessarily heavy burden upon them. Such a procedure might result in an additional charge being made to the policy-holders, and in their interests I suggest that the clause be allowed to stand in its present form. </para>
