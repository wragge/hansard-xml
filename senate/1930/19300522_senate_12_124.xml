        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Western Australia) &#91;3.7&#93;.  -  It was at my request that the Leader of the Government in the Senate placed this motion on the notice-paper. My object was not that I had any particular objection to the agreement arrived at with the German Government, but that I thought it was only right that the Senate should have an opportunity, if it desired, to express an opinion on a subject of such importance as an international agreement. That opportunity was afforded to another place. It is desirable, I think, that in all such matters, a motion should be moved to enable honorable senators if they so desire to express an opinion upon them, particularly when they are of so much importance as the ratification of an agreement between the Commonwealth and some other country. The agreement itself I have no desire to criticize, because it seems to me the only one possible in the circumstances, and I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> for having given the Senate an opportunity to discuss it. </para>

            <para>. - I regard the Commonwealth Constitution as a deed of partnership between the States themselves and between them and the Commonwealth, and it appears to me that all the parties to it should be consulted before any proposed alteration of it is submitted to the people. Is it not only just and proper that the amendment or amendments should be discussed by the State Parliaments, and some decision obtained there, before going to the referendum? Such amendment or amendments affect the constitutions of the States as well as the Constitution of the Commonwealth. There is no provision in the Constitution to enable the views of the State Parliaments to be obtained upon a proposed amendment, but I submit that such a provision would be a good thing, and would lead to greater harmony between the partners to the federal agreement. No proposals for the amendment of the Constitution are of value which do not recognize the vital importance of the functions allotted to the State Governments. The proposal now before the Senate absolutely transgresses that idea. This measure, if agreed to, would convert the Commonwealth into a unified parliamentary autocracy. </para>

            <para>The difficulties confronting Australia are serious, and a proper realization of them should result in whole-hearted co-operation of all sections in the working out of a satisfactory solution. Indeed, at the present juncture, the Parliament might fittingly become an economic conference of representatives of the people meeting to discuss the general position. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of all times that could be chosen for a discussion of these matters of vital and fundamental importance to the Commonwealth, none is more inopportune than the present. In support of that contention I call to my aid that concluding paragraph in the ministerial statement of policy where unity is the watchword. I am aware that practically the last refuge of the &#34;do nothing&#34; party, the party that would stagnate, is to say in regard to any proposal &#34; the time is not ripe.&#34; I admit that&#34; in one sense the time is ripe for a review of the Constitution. That is generally admitted by all parties. Various efforts have been made by the Commonwealth Parliament to obtain the sanction of the people to amendments of the Constitution, but, except in very slight particulars, they have failed. It may be said that the people were wrong, and that Parliament was right in those attempts. But those who pin their faith to democracy and declare that the voice of the people is the voice of God can hardly use that argument. It may be that Parliament was in error and that the people, whose voice is supreme, were right in their previous decisions in regard to constitutional amendments. </para>
          <para>The fact that some review is necessary has not only been recognized by those who have from time to time made spasmodic attempts to alter the Constitution; but there has been a general recognition by all parties that a sufficient period of time has elapsed, and that we have had sufficient experience in the working of our instrument ,of government, to justify an overhaul, to ascertain wherein lies its weakness, where it requires to be buttressed, and in what respect it may stand in need of radical amendment. But surely the time to carry out such a work is not when we are in dire straits, facing what the Government describes as &#34; serious difficulties &#34; ? The Government has indicated that in , its view the crisis is of sufficient magnitude to justify the setting aside of those differences which would ordinarily divide us into opposing camps, so that we may combine and unitedly concentrate in an endeavour to find a solution of the difficulties which beset our country. </para>
          <para>We know that the Government is hard pressed for money, that we have to face the prospect of very heavy burdens in the way of increased taxation, that there is a certain measure of apprehension as to the financial stability of the country, and that it will require all our strength, ability and resources to weather the . storm and find a way through. We in this chamber are sufficiently optimistic to believe that we can win through ; that the recuperative capacity of the country and the quality of its citizens are such that  we are not  likely to go under, but will come  out  satisfactorily. At the same time this is not a period when money should be spent unnecessarily. These proposed alterations of the Constitution will satisfy no vital immediate need, nor meet any present emergency. They are not required at this juncture. Yet what does the Government propose? It proposes to spend a sum of approximately  &#163;100,000  in submitting  those referendums to the people at a time when we have to wring money from the taxpayers and place upon their shoulders burdens grievous to be borne. The Government proposes to fritter away some &#163;100,000 in seeking amendments of the Constitution which, in my judgment, are not immediately necessary, and are not vital to the present situation. If the Government could show that these amendments are vital to the welfare of Australia it might have some justification in pushing on in an urgent way with the passage of these measures, and their subsequent submission to the people. I am confident, however, that no one who considered the subject impartially -would venture the opinion that the amendments are of vital necessity at this juncture. The Government contemplates something rather startling. It says : &#34; Times are bad, money is scarce and difficult to obtain, and the public exchequer is far from full. We, therefore, propose not to distribute the pamphlet which is usually issued when  a referendum is taken.&#34; This pamphlet sets forth the arguments for and against the proposals and informs the public mind upon them. I understand that the referendum itself would cost &#163;100,000 and that the publication of the pamphlet giving the arguments of the  propounders  and opponents of the proposal would cost &#163;25,000. If the Government&#39;s argument that this &#163;25,000 should be saved is sound, it should go further and get to the root of the matter. If the Government would say that, in view of existing circumstances, with an impoverished treasury and an almost depleted exchequer, it would not submit the proposals at the present time, but would choose a more convenient season, I could applaud its attitude. But to be prepared to spend &#163;100,000 on a referendum and nt the same time to deny to the electors an opportunity to consider calmly and dispassionately in their own homes the arguments for and against these proposals, is to act in a monstrous and preposterous way. Does the Government wish the people to vote blindly in battalions, without any impartial or intelligent individual consideration of the proposals? I ask the Government to reconsider that aspect of the matter. Even if this chamber rejects these proposals, they may still be submitted to the people. If they are to be submitted to the people, then the public mind should be informed regarding them, not merely through the medium of the press, or of party propaganda and election pamphlets, but also by the considered statements for which the statutes of this country provide. The very fact that the Government proposes to save &#163;25,000 by not issuing the usual pamphlet is a sweeping condemnation of the taking of the referendum at all. It is tantamount to an admission by the Government that, in the existing circumstances, this expenditure of public money is not justified. My first point, therefore, is that, at the present time, we shall do our country a serious injury if we waste public money in the taking of a referendum. The position would be different if we were living in happy, normal, care-free times. </para>
          <para>These proposals come with ill grace from a Government which has sent out a call for harmonious co-operation between all sections of the community. Had the Government itself shown any real desire for co-operation, the members of the party to which I belong would have gone more than half way to meet it. </para>

              <para>- I shall refer to that matter before I conclude my speech. The taking of a referendum would not only be a wasteful expenditure of public funds; it would also dissipate the strength of our people. This is not the time for class feuds or party warfare, or for the division of the people into hostile camps. It is a time when, in the language of the Government itself, &#34; the Parliament might fittingly become an economic conference of representatives of the people to discuss the general position &#34;. Is not that statement an implied call to unity, and concentration of purpose ? In a time of crisis the strength of the people should not.be dissipated in feuds, disputes and arguments, nor should public, private or party funds be expended unnecessarily. We should do nothing at such a time to divide the people. The energies which, if the proposals are submitted to the people, will be expended in fighting party shibboleths should be employed in greater unified effort and concentration of purpose. On those grounds also I condemn this proposal. </para>

          <para>I said earlier that there is a general feeling that the time is ripe for a review of the Constitution. To that end the Bruce-Page Government appointed a royal commission, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch was a distinguished member. The appointment of that commission was an indication that the former Government realized that the time was ripe for a reconsideration of certain aspects of this instrument of government. After the fullest inquiry, extending over a considerable time, the commission presented a voluminous and valuable report containing a number of suggestions for the amendment of the Constitution, but not one of those suggestions is incorporated in the proposals submitted to us for consideration. Following the report of the commission, the Bruce-Page Government proposed that there should be a special session of Parliament to consider constitutional amendments. Those things go to show, first, that this instrument of government is not sacrosanct; and, secondly, that it is no reflection on the framers of the Constitution to say that, after 30 years&#39; experience, it has been found that certain amendments are necessary or desirable. Experience teaches, and experience has shown that in many respects the Constitution is weak. Its framers made it flexible. They placed in section 128, which is being so much added to by this bill, the power of amendment. But - </para>

          <para class="block">The truth of those lines was realized by the late Government. It proposed to hold a special session of Parliament to consider constitutional amendments; but fate decided otherwise. It was powerless to fulfil its promise. The present Government, in the full plenitude of its power and the enthusiasm of its accession to office, determined to make wholesale amendments of the Constitution. I read with interest the treatise of the VicePresident of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> in introducing this bill. It was both interesting and illuminating; but I was not convinced. I gathered from it that there had been so many conflicting opinions of the High Court regarding interpretations of the Constitution that in the view of the Government the only thing to be done was for Parliament itself to interpret the Constitution. It therefore sought to give to Parliament itself the full power to make such amendments as it saw fit. </para>
          <para>The amendments of the Constitution proposed by this bill are not clear from a legal point of view. Apparently, the Leader of the . Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> thinks that all doubt, obscurity or difficulty of interpretation will disappear when this measure becomes law and is embodied in the Constitution. That seemed to be the general purport of the arguments ho used. I. have observed, however, that eminent constitutional authorities are doubtful, both as to the efficacy of this proposal and also as to its constitutionality. The arguments advanced in this chamber have revealed a real doubt on the part of honorable senators as to the effect of this measure  should it become law. For example there is doubt as to whether this proposal would abrogate the last paragraph of section 128 of the Constitution. Eminent legal authorities doubt the capacity of this Parliament to pass this particular measure. They contend that it is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. I do not desire, at this stage, to debate that aspect of the subject ; I mention it merely as an answer to the implied statement of the Leader of the Government in this chamber, that by this simple amendment, which would transfer to the Parliament itself the power to amend the Constitution without reference to the people, we shall clear away all doubt, make the Constitution as clear as crystal, and overcome all difficulties of interpretation. Even while this measure is under consideration by the Federal Parliament, a grave doubt has arisen as to its legal significance and effect. </para>
          <para>All honorable senators know of the carious efforts that were made to bring about the federation of the Australian colonies. They are aware of the conferences aud conventions that preceded the conception of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick that a popular convention that would be inspired by the vote of the people, and into which the spirit of life would be breathed by the people, should be held. I venture to suggest that that inspiration did more to hasten the bringing about of an agreement between the colonies of Australia at that time than any other single idea. It grew in strength and spirit at the referendum, and in that way the Constitution found its birth. What&#34; does this Government propose to do? it proposes to wipe out the referendum. This Government, composed of members of a party that has advocated the initiative, referendum and recall for the past 30 or 40 years - a party that has spoken of democracy and the voice of the people - now says that the people&#39;s voice shall not be heard, except insofar as by an expression of opinion at a general election. He would, indeed, be a bold man who would interpret in the fullest detail a mandate or decision of the people at a general election. The issue in one State might be quite different from that in another State; it would be almost impossible to confine an election to a single issue such as a proposed . amendment of the Constitution. That is not the way in which a Government can obtain a mandate from the people. The Leader of the Opposition in this chamber referred to what might happen if the Labour party were in power. The right honorable gentleman said that merely by the change-over of three seats in the Senate the Labour party might obtain full control in both branches of the legislature, and then all safeguards, all the restrictions which are to buttress the liberties of the people and preserve the sanctity of this contract between the Commonwealth and the States, would disappear. Not only is that possible under an amendment of this kind, but the reverse would be equally true. The swinging-over of a few votes, the loss of a few seats, and a reactionary party might be placed in authority and have the same power to amend the Constitution without reference to the people. </para>
          <para>From the point of view of the Labour platform that might be just as inimical to that party&#39;s interest or to its progress. The proposal might not always be advantageous to the party represented by the present Government. It is full of danger. </para>
          <para>I can find no merit or virtue in this proposal. Let us preserve the right of the people to determine these issues. The Constitution is a contract between the Commonwealth and the States. I  remember  the arguments that were used when the acceptance or rejection of the Constitution Bill was before the people of this country. I remember the arguments advanced against the principle of equality of representation in the Senate, for example, but the people accepted the Constitution in good faith and were prepared to trust the Federal Parliament. Section 128 of the Constitution is the security given to the high contracting parties, yet by a stroke of the pen this Government proposes to delete that safeguard and security, and do violence to our Constitution. I trust that when this proposal comes before the public it will respond in no uncertain way. The fate of the measure, so far as this chamber is concerned, seems clear. There will be u strong majority against it, but that will not prevent its submission to the people. I know that my friends of democratic sentiment and progressive ideas say that this is a way in which to destroy the Legislative Councils of the States, which they contend are a bar to progress and handicap the parliamentary machine. And so they say, &#34; Let us do this thing. Let us create one central government with full authority. Let us so cripple the States that finally the Commonwealth will be divided into so many provinces and county councils.&#34; That is the object of the Labour party. The way to amend the State constitutions is provided for. It was never contemplated by the framers of the federal instrument of government or by the people of Australia that it would be used to destroy the State constitutions. But the Labour party say, &#34; This is an easy, quick and accessible way to the abolition of the State Legislative Councils. We will repose the full power and authority in the Commonwealth Parliament, and by gradually encroaching on the State spheres, strangle them and render their constitutions abortive.&#34; </para>

A great deal more could be said, but as the ground has been well covered, I do not desire to unduly delay the Senate at this stage. Tor the reasons I have given, and for many others which could be advanced, I intend to record my vote against the second reading of this bill. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>GEOEGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) &#91;3.41&#93;. - After listening to the introductory speech of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> on this bill and another similar measure to amend the Constitution I could not help wondering why the Government had submitted these proposals. Indulging in some musings, I endeavoured to put myself in the place of the Leader of the Government, metaphorically speaking, of course, to ascertain the underlying motive for the presentation of these amending constitution bills. Ministers and their supporters are in this position: During the election campaign last year they made a number of the wildest possible promises, never dreaming that they would be returned with a majority and called upon to honour them. Now that they are in power they find these promises hanging over their heads and at the same time they are faced with all the administrative difficulties incidental to a serious business and industrial depression which is responsible for a volume of unemployment unexampled in the history of Australia during the last 25 years. One of their election pledge&#39;s was that, if returned, they would amend the arbitration laws. They objected to the proposal of the Bruce-Page administration to vacate the field of arbitration and posing as the champions of federal arbitration, declared that, if they were returned, they would introduce legislation to free it from legal entanglements and make the court easier of access to all industrial organizations. But like many other promises which Ministers and their supporters made, they find this impossible of fulfilment. They realize possibly that they would not be doing very much even if they did rid arbitration of its legal entanglements, and hedged about as they are with all the difficulties and embarrassment arising out of their election engagements they say: &#34;Let us have a referendum to divert the minds of the people from our election promises and give them something to talk about. They will then forget our pledges relating to the coal trouble, unemployment and arbitration. They will ignore all these things in the excitement and fight over a referendum. Hang the cost. Let us distract the attention of the people from the real issues confronting them.&#34; </para>
        <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson,</inline> who said when speaking to the motion for the second reading of the bill which seeks to confer upon the Parliament power to amend the Constitution, that this is the worst possible time for an appeal to the people. Their thoughts are at the moment directed to the removal of the business and industrial depression which has brought this country to its present position, and they are wondering how it will be possible to overcome the difficulties confronting them. This referendum will do nothing to relieve the situation. Even if this amendment is endorsed by the people it will be impossible to pass necessary legislation within twelve or eighteen months, and no one can honestly say that it will provide employment for one additional man in Australia; or in anyway help to lift the cloud of depression that has settled over the Commonwealth in the last year or two. Actually it will have as much effect upon the present situation of the Commonwealth as a mustard plaster would have upon a wooden leg. But since the Government has brought forward these proposals, the Senate must debate them. </para>

            <para>- I agree that it is a most important matter, but it is not one upon which a federal election should be fought. All such matters should be referred to arbitral tribunals and decided on their merits and on the ability of the country to do what it is asked to do. Of all bodies Parliament is the least qualified to deal satisfactorily with complex industrial problems. But there is another fundamental difference between the present proposals and those submitted by the Bruce-Page Administration in 1926. The preceding Government had in view the elimination of overlapping awards, which have been responsible for so much confusion and chaos in the industrial life of this country. Had its proposals been adopted it would have been possible to legislate effectively to prevent this overlapping ; but, as I have said, the people, by a substantial majority, withheld their endorsement. The Government accepted the verdict, and in 1929 brought forward legislative proposals to meet the evil of overlapping in another way. It introduced a bill, the purport of which was to vacate the field of arbitration, retaining control only over the maritime and  waterside industries, which are truly federal in character. It proposed to allow State Governments to regulate all other branches of industry. If effect had been given to them again there would have been a complete over-coming of the overlapping and confusion that arise when two bodies are legislating and dealing with the same subject in the same arena. The late Government&#39;s proposal was not carried by Parliament, and the Government was unable to obtain the necessary majority in the country at the subsequent election to give effect to it. </para>

        <para>In introducing this bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly,</inline> I am pleased to say, drew attention to the fact that the Australian Labour party and the Australian party were allied on this issue. Although we have always known that the two parties are allied, it is very satisfactory to get that declaration. We know now where the Australian party is. I am reminded of the description I read a little while ago of the pilot fish. It is said that sharks that infest our coast - I hope honorable senators opposite will not take exception to the simile - are accompanied by pilot fish. As the latter are not able to keep pace with the sharks they attach themselves to the bodies of the sharks, and when the latter secure a victim, the pilot fish are allowed to pick up the scraps. Apparently the Australian party is to play the part of pilot fish to the Australian Labour party, and for the support it gives will be allowed to pick up any of the scraps that fall from the table of the larger party. </para>
        <para>A peculiarity of the present Government&#39;s proposal is that it allows for the continuance of the dual system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that our powers under the Constitution are not wide enough to remove the present evil, and that the Government is submitting its present proposal for the alteration of the Constitution with a view to the removal of that evil. Are not the evils in our industrial system entirely due to the fact that we have two legislative bodies operating in the same field ? </para>

The pre sent proposal for the alteration of the Constitution will not remove that evil; on the contrary, it will perpetuate it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said, &#34;Both sides admit the confusion and chaos existing &#34;, and he quoted the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution to the effect that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot legislate to fix wages and hours.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.The honorable senator is welcome to his opinion, but in my judgment it is the last thing to be desired on behalf of this Parliament. A national parliament should be concerned with national matters. Under this proposal it will be not only possible, but almost certain, that every tin-pot industrial dispute throughout the Commonwealth will be dragged on to the floor of one or other of the chambers in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that the effect of carrying the Government&#39;s proposal would be to make the system of arbitration more effective to remove the evils that exist. My reply is that the Government&#39;s proposal will not have the effect of removing the dual system, and must tend to perpetuate the confusion and chaos that now exist. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> it will enable the Commonwealth to enter into the field now covered by the State.Will that not mean an extension or perpetuation of the existing evils? The proposal is not to remove the State from the arena, hut for the Commonwealth to further enter upon the arena. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> spoke of the service of a log by the parties as creating the dispute. If the Government&#39;s proposal is carried will not the parties still have the choice of serving the log for hearing before either a State or the Federal tribunal? That being so, the decision will rest with the union of employers or employees. It will have the privilege of serving the log and deciding the tribunal to determine it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.The federal law will operate only when the union desires it to operate. If it desires to go to a State court, it will have the right to do so. It is but a maintenance, of the fundamental&#39; principle to which the present Government committed itself absolutely at the last election - that the unions should have the choice of the State or the Federal Court; and the Government and its supporters dare not say to the unions, &#34;We shall confine you to the Federal Court&#34;. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said &#34; What the Government is endeavouring to bring about is uniformity&#34;. This bill will not provide means for doing so because, as I have already pointed out, the two parties will still have Federal and State courts open to them and can make their choice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> quoted from the report of the Industrial Peace Conference held in Melbourne in 1928, as to the effect of one State competing with another in the matter of industrial and social legislation... But that is exactly what the Government is now proposing to do. It proposes that the Federal Parliament shall; h&#38; an. even greater competitor than it has  been in- the past. Its proposal -.is not to get rid of the competition between -State and State in this industrial field, not to have six competitors with partial additional competition from the Commonwealth, but to have seven competitors in the limited field of arbitration. It is also proposed that the Commonwealth Parliament should deal with all phases of industrial relations, not merely laws relating to industrial disputes, but also factory legislation, duplicating what is already so well done in all .the States, that it should invade the State arena by passing Workers Compensation legislation and such like, running the whole gamut of industrial legislation now on the statutebooks of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins to the effect that there should not be a choice of two tribunals. I wonder that he should have done so, because this amendment, if carried, will make the choice of two tribunals a permanent feature of our Constitution. The proposal is not to have exclusive power in industrial matters, but to share a dual power between the Commonwealth and the States. There is nothing to prevent an alteration of the Constitution to give exclusive industrial power to the .Commonwealth, but the present proposal does not go that far. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that the Government&#39;s proposal &#34;is the only way to co-ordinate the dual system.&#34; That blessed word &#34; co-ordination !&#34; What does it mean? And in any case, why the need for co-ordination? Why not let each State be the&#34; judge of its own industrial conditions? Why teach our grandmothers to suck eggs? Adult franchise  operates in the States and the people elect the popular houses in which industrial legislation is initiated. Are not the people of the States the best judges of the kind of arbitration they want? We are not, by this proposed alteration, depriving them of the power to legislate, but apparently we are to say to them : &#34; We propose to co-ordinate your legislation with something we intend to do.&#34; My reply to the Government is, &#34; Get yourselves out of the way or get the States out of the way, and there will be no need for co-ordination. Make up your minds to have one authority, Federal or State, and then there will be no need for coordination.&#34; All this talk about co-ordination is idle. As aimed at in this bill it is mere meddlesome interference. I go sofar as to say that it is vicious interference; That is the cause of the overlapping, confusion and chaos we have had ever since the Commonwealth has entered the field. This bill will not cure it. On the contrary, it will perpetuate it. </para>
        <para>It is the wrong time to bring forward a proposal of this sort. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson</inline> that this country cannot afford to spend &#163;100,000 on a wrangle over a matter that will not effect a cure or take us one step forward, but on the contrary, will have a disturbing effect on the country. Why has it been brought forward? I have been able to obtain a report of the proceedings of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, held in Melbourne on 22nd February last, and I propose to read some very pertinent extracts from the report of its arbitration committee, to show the objective of those who are behind the Government in this matter.

        <para>That is signed by the seven gentlemen who signed the other resolution that I have read. The significant point about the whole thing is that a report appeared in the press purporting to be a record of the congress, but these resolutions were not published. That may indicate that they wanted the Government to consider the resolutions before they were given publicity. Having obtained a copy I thought it desirable to give the resolutions publicity in this debate, so that the public would know what the Government is aiming at. If the public is lured into voting for this amendment of the Constitution, it cannot grumble when these things are given effect to by the Government, at the direction of their masters. </para>
        <para>It is also instructive to consider what will be the administration of the law when the Government has power to make any law that it likes in respect to arbitration. The party that the Government, represents is, to say the least of it, suspect in its administration of arbitration awards, because of the attitude that it adopted when in opposition. In some cases it openly aided and abetted rebellion against the law, while in other cases it condoned infringements by its silence.

        <para>Secretary&#39;s Report. &#34; We meet now at a time most critical for railwaymen and the Australian Railways Union, because of the private employers&#39; and Railways Commissioners&#39; onslaught in all States on our hours and wages standards,&#34; said the report presented by the State secretary <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. A. Chapman),</inline> which, by a special suspension of standing orders, was given first place on the business-sheet. &#34; In the past twelve months there had been a series of industrial struggles throughout the Commonwealth. The timber-workers&#39; strike was the outstanding one. Judge Lukin, &#39; the ablestand most audacious legal preserver of capitalist privilege in this country,&#39; had snatched from the timber-workers the 44-hour week that they had enjoyed for six and a half years. Judge Lukin&#39;s action was unconstitional, because the Full Court had directed him merely to interpret the hours clause, and given him no direction to amend or alter it in any way. But it was what employers&#39; organizations throughout the country, banks, foreign financiers, and loan workers had been yearning for. Judge Lukin was the Arbitration Court leader for whom they had been praying. The timber- workers had decided on a strike as their final protest against the return of the 48-hour week. They would not have 48 hours. Nor would the railwayworkers. The maintenance of wages and hours standards and resistance to a reactionary Arbitration Court, which had assumed leadership for the employing class, were the issues that confronted the union movement. . . . &#34; </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Against New Log.</inline>taking over the industry. </para>
      <para>Members of the Australian Railways Union are to counter the Railways Commissioners&#39; service of a new log on railway employees by methods which include a &#34; regulation &#34; strike. A motion to this effect, moved by the State secretary of&#39; the Australian Railways Union <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. A, Chapman),</inline> was enthusiastically and unanimously carried by the State conference of the union at to-day&#39;s sitting. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman&#39;s</inline>motion read as follows: </para>
      <para>This conference draws the attention of the Australian Railways Union to the conduct of the Railways Commissioners in serving a log of claims upon all railway employees for the express purpose of further delaying the hearing of the claims of the Australian Railways Union for improved conditions. We recognize in this act an attack upon existing conditions, and declare our intention of resisting the same by a strict observance of the departmental regulations. We call upon all other unions operating in the service to join with us - (1) in putting forward the maximum resistance . to the Commissioners&#39; log; (2) to work for the elimination of bogus organizations, non-unionism, and other undermining influences; (3) to conduct regular meetings at depots and work-shops: (4) to issue propaganda exposing the tyranny of departmental officials and the abuses perpetrated upon railway employees; (5) to set up and encourage the formation of job and shop committees, and prepare workers for the taking over of control of industry.&#34; </para>
      <para>Following vigorous discussion the motion was lost, and an amendment approving the Australian Railways Union Central Council&#39;s previous decision to expose the Federal Arbitration Court as an institution of class domination was carried. </para>
      <para class="block">That is the attitude of many of the unions which comprise the Australasian Council of Trade Unions at whose behest this amendment of the Constitution is sought. That will be their attitude towards any law which proposes to mete out justice as between employer and employee. The only crime which the Railways Commissioner of New SouthWales had committed was that he presented a log to the court. He had not endeavoured to enforce the conditions set out in that log; he had simply presented the log to the court for that body to adjudicate upon it. Yet even that action gave rise to that violent language and those hostile resolutions. </para>
      <para>If this bill becomes law, and the Constitution is altered accordingly, this Parliament will become an industrial Parliament. I warn the Senate of the danger associated with such a state of affairs. The various political parties would undoubtedly start bidding against one another for the votes of the industrial section of the community. </para>
      <para class="block">We have seen evidence of the danger of that state of affairs in connexion with old-age pensions. I could cite instances in which political parties have, in the most audacious fashion, made bids for the votes of old-age pensioners. But what happened in connexion with them would be as a drop in the ocean compared with what would happen if parties endeavoured to outbid one another for the votes of the industrialists of this country. If parties are prepared to prostitute themselves in order to gain the small number of votes represented by old-age pensioners, what would happen, if wages and conditions of labour were made the issue at any election? Such things should be decided in the cool atmosphere of arbitral tribunals, not in a parliament composed of parties bidding against each other for power. </para>
      <para>The Government claims that it needs these additional powers to deal effectively with industrial evils in the community. Supposing it had possessed the powers it now seeks, what could it have done in the prevailing coal disputes ? The trouble in the coal-mining industry, which has extended for over twelve months, has caused tremendous losses to the community, and has been largely responsible for our present depression. If the Government had appointed a tribunal to deal with their grievances, would the coal-miners have obeyed its awards, seeing that in the past they have treated all tribunals with scorn ? Would the Government have solved the problem by nationalizing the coal-mines? The trouble with the coal industry is that the price of coal is toohigh. Have we any guarantee that the price of coal would be reduced by nationalizing the industry? Experience teaches us that coal would have been dearer still had the mines been nationalized. But even supposing that the price of coal were reduced, would that remove the possibility of industrial disputes in the coal-mines? Would a coalminer work in nationalized coal-mines any more amicably than he would work for a private employer ? We have the answer to that question in the attitude of the railway employees who were working in a nationalized industry. They talked of revolt and of taking illegal action to prevent the Railways Commissioner from even having his log presented to the court. Have we any guarantee that the coalminers would be any more reasonable than the railway employees were? This amendment of the Constitution would not have enabled the Government to solve the coal trouble. </para>

          <para>- The Government, finding itself unable to open the coal-mines within fourteen days, as promised, seeks to condone its false promises by saying that if granted additional powers it will do wonderful things. It has been careful all along not to say what it would do even if granted the powers it seeks. If this measure becomes law the evils of the dual system will be perpetuated. This legislation will do nothing to help Australia to face her difficulties or to bring us out of the present depression. On the contrary, it will be more likely to accentuate our present difficulties. It will not find work for one man who to-day is unemployed. It will not solve the problems with which this Senate ought to be grappling. The bill is a subterfuge, a refusal by the Government to face our problems. I shall vote against it, and I believe that the people of Australia will reject it if it comes before them. </para>

          <para>. - The right honorable leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> has given a number of reasons - some relevant and others irrelevant - why he will oppose this bill. I hope that other honorable senators opposite will not follow his lead, but that they will  give the proposal their serious consideration, and decide its fate on its merits. The right honorable gentleman also said that even if the proposal embodied in the bill receives the approval of the people, it will not remove the evils of the dual system. In saying that, he did not state the position correctly. If the power sought in thisbill is conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament, it will be able to pass arbitration laws which will supersede the laws of the States. The co-ordination referred to by the VicePresident of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> did not refer to any attempt to bring about a union of two conflicting systems, but to a desire, on the part of those who believe in federal arbitration, to do that which is best in the interests of Australia: The State tribunals would work in conjunctionwith the Federal Arbitration Court. </para>

        <para class="block">In that clause there is no limitation of the jurisdiction of the federal court; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> pointed out, that court would naturally work in conjunction with the State courts, where possible, thereby retaining that which is best in the arbitration legislation of the States. In considering this bill we ought to review the whole incidence of legislation designed to maintain a measure of industrial peace. Let us visualize the conditions which existed over 30 years ago when the Constitution was being moulded. At that time industrial arbitration, wage fixation, and conciliation courts or tribunals were in their infancy in this country. Trade unionism also was in its infancy. We are all familiar with the circumstances which led to the formation of political and industrial organizations of labour in Australia. The rapacity of employers in the early &#39;nineties, when they seized upon the prevailing depression to exact what to us now appear to be almost incomprehensible terms from their workers, caused the workers to enter the industrial field, and, later, the political field. Out of that organization there arose a measure of wage fixation and also tribunals to settle disputes between employers and employees. The whole system was in an embryo stage when the Constitution was being moulded. </para>
        <para class="block">The convention at which the Constitution was moulded was attended by representatives of the different States. Australian political history shows that the States were then considering this subject from different viewpoints. Some States had established wages boards and other such tribunals to determine wages and conditions of employment generally, while others were watching what they regarded as an experiment. In those circumstances one would naturally expect a lack of desire on the part of the delegates to the Federal Convention to confer anything in the nature of extended industrial powers upon this Parliament. Section 51 of the Constitution confers upon this Parliament the power to make laws in relation to disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, but all other industrial powers were left to the States. With the development of a new industrial system, the setting up of industries for mass production adjacent to sources of power, the linking up of industrial organizations between States, the establishment of federal organizations, and the competition that ensued between manufacturers in different States, there was created a desire on the part of employers and employees to seek the shelter of the Federal Arbitration Court. With the federation of employers&#39; and employees&#39; organizations, a greater number of industries and employers and employees was gradually brought under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court. The varying interpretations of article xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution further widened the ambit of federal industrial legislation. As an illustration I may cite the State instrumentalities case. When federal arbitration was first introduced, it was held by the High Court that the employees of State instrumentalities were not entitled to approach the Federal Court, but later when the personnel of the High Court .Bench had been changed, this decision was reversed and State employees were brought within the ambit of the Federal Court. This, I suggest was due to some extent to the growth of public opinion and the desire for industrial peace. Thirty years ago, there were no world courts for the settlement of international disputes, but to-day, they are actually in operation. </para>
        <para class="block">Is it not reasonable to assume that as the people of the world are seeking international peace, so is peace being sought in the industrial arena by the use of similar machinery. That point has, I think, been admitted by the two principal sections of political thought in this country. I believe that in the main honorable senators opposite support the principle of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes, and for that reason I do not think they are likely to be influenced by the utterances of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> who referred to the actions of extremists. If I were to adopt that line of reasoning, in combating the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, I could produce many instances in which employers exhibited unreasonable tendencies towards their employees, and show that they advocated schemes for the destruction of the arbitration machinery of this country. In some instances they suggested that we should revert to the law of the jungle and of individual bargaining which once obtained. </para>

            <para>- This issue should not be determined upon the utterances of extremists on either side, but should be considered from the viewpoint of a great majority of the employers and employees. According to the figures published in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year Booh,</inline> there are approximately 700,000 trade unionists registered under the Federal Arbitration Court and over 400,000 operating under awards of that court, a great majority of whom are working satisfactorily, peacefully and consistently and obeying the awards of the court as are a majority of the employers. On the other hand, there are some on both sides in favour of the abolition of all forms of arbitration, but they are not in sufficient numbers or of sufficient importance to warrant serious consideration being given to their opinions. Generally speaking, our arbitration system has been a great success, and despite what has been said to the effect that Australia is a hotbed of industrial unrest, the statistics of other countries disclose that the working days lost in </para>

        <para class="block">That could be amplified by the utterances of other employers of labour in Australia. We should not continually traduce our Australian workmen, but recognize that in the main they are doing their work well. </para>
        <para>The Leader of the Opposition appealed to honorable senators to reject this measure, which, he said, if passed by Parliament; and approved by the people of Australia, would have the effect of making the Commonwealth Parliament an industrial Parliament. Does not that danger exist in connexion with the State Parliaments to-day? Apart from the industrial powers conferred upon this Parliament, the power to make laws governing conditions of employment is held by State Parliaments. Is it not possible under the present conditions for each State Parliament to become an industrial parliament? Is that not one of the dangers that would be avoided by conferring complete industrial power upon this Parliament? While the States possess certain industrial powers there is, in consequence of varying State policies, a real and grave danger. If the State Parliaments are permitted to legislate in the matter of wage fixation and the conditions of labour or in the appointment of tribunals to assess such wages and conditions industrial development may be seriously retarded. It has been contended both by employers and employees that with our modern forms of transport, and our huge volume of interstate trade, standard working conditions should prevail throughout Australia. We should have established principles which will operate similarly throughout Australia after making allowance, of course, for local conditions in those districts where they are of sufficient importance to justify recognition. The Federal Arbitration Court operating under the increased powers which the Government seeks to secure under this measure is the only authority capable of providing for this. </para>

            <para>- The 1926 proposals sought to confer enlarged industrial powers, not on this Parliament, but on a Commonwealth tribunal, which is a vastly different thing.

        <para>A hint that the Federal Government still had hopes of obtaining full control of arbitration was dropped by the Prime Minister tonight. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said he was, and always had been, of opinion that the Commonwealth, with full industrial powers, could make a better job of arbitration than the States. With limited powers, however, federal control was impossible. The people might yet decide that the Commonwealth was the proper authority to control arbitration, and it was always competent for them to do so, presumably by referendum. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline>clearly was of the opinion that the Commonwealth Parliament could control the arbitral laws of Australia better than the States. This opinion, it should be noted, was expressed subsequent to the refusal of the State Premiers, who represented divergent political views, to cede to the Commonwealth the power which the Prime Minister had requested should be given. In the circumstances, I contend that no honorable senator who endorsed the views of the former Prime &#39; Minister concerning this matter, can now vote against this bill, the object of which is to give effect to the policy enunciated by the former Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> emphasized that the Commonwealth, exercising full industrial powers, could make a better job of arbitration than the States. If he had any thought about enlarging the powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, dr some other Commonwealth tribunal, he would have said so. Is it now suggested that it was his intention to make the Arbitration Court supreme over Parliament? This proposal asks the people to vest in the Commonwealth full industrial power, so that Parliament may direct the arbitral tribunal as to how that power shall be used. It does not seek to vest this power in a tribunal beyond the reach of Parliament, as contemplated in the 1926 proposals. In the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of the same date, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Potts,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Sydney Chamber of Manufactures, expressed views similar to those enunciated by the former Prime Minister.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">They believed that the elimination of dual control was imperative, and that there should be one tribunal to hold the balance fairly between the manufacturers in the various States. The only tribunal capable of doing this is the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court. It is obvious from the provisions of section 51 that the framers of the Constitution intended that this Parliament should be responsible for the maintenance of industrial standards in Australia. That sec1 ti on provides for uniformity in regard to the tariff, taxation, and the payment of bounties. In all matters affecting.pro1duction, business and taxation, this Parliament is directed by the Constitution to maintain an equal application of basic principles. It is specifically directed to see that the industrial conditions applied to one State are in conformity with the conditions in other States. Had the framers of the Constitution the knowledge which we to-day possess concerning the growth of arbitration systems for the maintenance of industrial peace, they would have been just as clear and specific in their direction that the Commonwealth Parliament should have full power to enact laws for the prevention of industrial disputes. Since it is established that the framers of the Constitution intended this Parliament to have full authority over conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of disputes, it is essential that full authority should be vested in the Commonwealth. Accordingly we must turn to other avenues to seek the motives for opposition to this measure. Following the failure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> to induce the Premiers of the States to surrender control of industrial matters to the Federal Parliament, the Bruce-Page administration endeavoured to rid itself of responsibility. It introduced legislation providing that the Commonwealth should vacate the field of industrial conciliation and arbitration except in regard to two or three industries which are essentially federal in character. Industries which for a long period of years had been divorced from the authority of State tribunals and had come within the protective shelter of the federal tribunal, were to be driven back to the jurisdiction of the States. Strangely enough we find that whilst Nationalist members in this Parliament apparently have never wavered in their espousal of the principle of arbitration, representatives of the Nationalist party in State Parliaments have been consistently striving to abolish the system. In South Australia, to quote one instance, a Nationalist Government under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell, who afterwards became a member of this chamber, introduced legislation in 1923 for the abolition of State industrial tribunals. At one fell swoop <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell proposed to destroy the work of many years. If he had been successful, that section of the workers which for reasons mentioned earlier in my remarks, were not able to obtain access to the Federal Arbitration Court, would have been totally unprotected by any system of arbitration. Fortunately that measure was defeated, although it had the support of nearly every Nationalist member in the House of Assembly. It was only the defection of two men who placed their election pledges to retain arbitration before their party interests which saved the situation m 1923; and from that date onwards we have had the present leader of the Nationalist party in South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Butler),</inline> who was a member of the State House when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell introduced this bill and strongly supported it, continually advocating the abolition of State arbitration. . </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator assisted in putting on the statute-book in days gone by quite a lot of legislation in which he does not now believe. It is the same with other honorable senators opposite. There are, therefore, some pages in history which do not give us any clear guidance to the future. We must, however, take cognizance of the attitude of the party as a party. One of the very first acts of the Moore Government, following upon its return to office in Queensland in May of last year, was to suspend an award of the Queensland Arbitration Court. The Bavin Government in New South Wales did the same thing. Honorable senators opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say in this chamber that they believe in arbitration and then go outside and seek to abolish the effects of arbitration legislation. The only means by which a clear conception of their attitude can be secured is for them to show their belief in arbitration by their support of this bill. It has been introduced with a desire to improve the federal arbitration system and make it more workable and more conducive to industrial peace by eliminating the evils of overlapping, particularly the evil that accrues through the lack of power of the Federal Court to make a common rule. </para>

            <para>- The conditions most requisite for the recovery of industrial and financial health in the Commonwealth are that the people should he given as much liberty and freedom as possible to adjust themselves to the difficult state of affairs to-day, and that every possible economy both public and private should be practised in order  to  provide the necessary capital to carry on and restore or increase the production of commodities. What is the object of this amendment of the Constitution ? Is it to aid the reconstruction of industry and increase production? First of all, it will involve the country in a huge and unnecessary expenditure, which must be recovered from a people already staggering under a dreadful burden of taxation. Secondly, when every thought should be directed towards restoring the finances of the country, it will invite turmoil and disturbance throughout the Commonwealth. People will hesitate to start new enterprises until the question is finally settled. They will ask themselves, &#34; What new burdens are to be cast upon us if this amendment is carried?&#34; Every person who has an idea of starting a new business must ask himself, &#34; Will a new act be passed compelling me to pay such wages or comply with such conditions as Parliament may decide?&#34; We have already seen how an attempt has been made in the Cotton Industries Bounty Bill to impose such conditions as would deprive the growers of any benefit from it. Are we, then, tobe committed to a system by which every new industry is to be harassed and subjected to constant interference directed to secure the whole reward of labour to the worker? We have seen that every railway in Australia has been reduced to a state of bankruptcy by political control and interference. If this proposed power be secured for the Commonwealth every industry, as shown by the proposals mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> may expect to be reduced to the same chaotic condition. As has been pointed out, also, there is no intention to abolish the dual control of which the Leader of the Government in the Senate complained.. There is nothing in the present proposal to say that the. Commonwealth&#39;s jurisdiction shall be exclusive. If the Government were sincere it would be easy to provide that, when assumed by the Commonwealth, this jurisdiction should be absolutely exclusive, and that the people should not be able to dodge back to a State jurisdiction if it suited them better. But, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> would never agree to that. He wants to be free to bring about a 30-hour week if he returns to power. He would be out of the limelight altogether. Exclusive jurisdiction, therefore, must not be proposed, for fear of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang&#39;s</inline> antagonism. </para>

          <para>It is a fatal objection to these proposals that it will make this Parliament the arena for debates on purely local matters, such as how many hours a week the Wyndham slaughtermen should work. The State Parliaments are finding it difficult enough to keep abreast of their work in dealing with these matters of local government. If we were to start dealing with them a great increase of members in this Parliament would be inevitable, and we should have to carry on with a system of committees such as now obtains in Great Britain. That that system has proved largely a failure is evident from the proposals for home rule in Scotland and Wales and England in order to leave the National Parliament free to deal with matters of truly national importance. </para>

          <para class="block">I invite special attention to the words &#34; any trade, industry, profession, occupation or calling.&#34; We may have, under these terms, legislation regarding State servants, the admission of barristers or solicitors, or regulating the right of medical practitioners or dentists to practice their professions, or the right of teachers to open schools. The licensing of these professional gentlemen to practise could be made subject to the employment of unionists only, or to some other condition that would hamper and hinder the development of industry and employment in this country. Take then the words &#34; the maintenance of industrial peace.&#34; What do they mean ? What is the object of them? It can only be that with these words and a convenient fiction which itis hoped will arise in the High Court the design is to obtain control of the whole field of legislation in as full and ample a manner as that for which the bill with which we last dealt provided, under the guise that it is necessary for the maintenance of industrial peace. For instance, State railways might be taken over by the Commonwealth. It would only be necessary to promote a general strike on the State railways and then the Commonwealth could proceed to use this power which it is now seeking to take complete control over the State railways. Yet honorable senators of the Labour party have the effrontery to pretend that the present proposal does not go further than that of the Bruce-Page Government in 1926 or the proposal which emanated from the conference of the State Premiers in 1928. Recently I saw an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> in which it was contended that the only power which should be committed to the Arbitration Court was one to raise wages; that it should have no power under any circumstances to lower them. If this amendment of the Constitution is carried it will be quite competent to introduce a measure to prevent the Arbitration Court from lowering wages. It is only necessary to provide in the preamble to the measure that it is for the maintenance of indus trial peace ; the High Court would go no further. It would not consider whether the act was or was not actually designed or suitable for the maintenance of industrial peace. </para>

              <para>- Parliament is supreme, but it cannot override the judgment of a court. It has never been suggested that Parliament should try people charged with murder or try cases involving thousands of pounds. Why should this Parliament, in industrial matters, usurp powers which properly belong to an outside body or court? It was the intention of the Bruce-Page Government to commit these industrial mattersto tribunals which would have the opportunity to call evidence and make just awards. The present Arbitration Court has repeatedly refused to grant absolute preference to unionists, recognizing that that monopoly, if granted, would undoubtedly be abused. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline>contended that we should not create a court beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament. The very conception of British justice is that a court shall be absolutely beyond the control of the executive or legislature. For that reason the salaries and appointments of judges of the High Court are for a life term. Until recently it was the convention that those judges should not expect promotion. They had nothing to hope for and nothing to fear. This Government has departed from the tradition and. promoted <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs to the position of Chief Justice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> also said that the change in the decisions of the High Court that first of all excluded State instrumentalities from Commonwealth jurisdiction and then included them was due to a change in public opinion. But what are the facts? When the referendum was taken asking for power for the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with State instrumentalities it was rejected. By judicious appointments which changed the political complexion of the High Court, a so-called change of public opinion was effected, but the rejection of the referendum proved that there had been no change of public opinion in the matter. What makes the thing appear worse is the reward by promotion of a judge of the High Court. It is quite evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> does not want a court at all. He wants an obedient body like the Public Service Board, which at one time we fondly believed to be beyond parliamentary control. </para>

I have the highest respect for his capabilities, and I think that his decisions have been free from political bias. Although the unions made a considerable outcry when he was appointed judge, they have, for a number of months, been astonishingly quiet with regard to him. On the other hand, they have taken a dead set against Judge Lukin, who has no connexion with any political party, and who was appointed from the Queensland Bench, as a member of which he had a high and honorable record. It is only because decisions do not suit them that honorable senators opposite and their supporters refuse to adopt a fairand reasonable attitude.

          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce so eloquently pointed out, there is nothing in this bill to prevent the wasteful system of duplication of courts and wages boards; nothing to ensure any increase of production, or to preserve continuity of industry. It will do nothing to lighten the burdens under which our producers are laboring, and it will in no way  clarify the existing legal position. The whole measure is couched in the vaguest of terms. The Government is really asking for a blank cheque to be signed in its favour. I believe that it is overreaching itself. If it were willing to circumscribe the field of this legislation along the lines of the scheme put forward by the Bruce-Page Government in 1926, it would have a greater chance of obtaining its objective.For the reasons that I have advanced, I propose to vote against the bill. </para>

          <para>Before dealing further with the bill, I should like to draw attention to one or two remarks on the subject that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran.</inline> The honorable senator contended that we, on this side of the chamber, refuse to recognize that the workers of Australia are efficient and able to perform their jobs well. I think that I speak for other honorable senators of the Opposition when I claim that we have always recognized and appreciated the efficiency of the Australian worker. We also recognize that that efficiency has been stultified to a great extent by the inefficiency of those who lead them. I, and others, have often contended that if the Australian worker were left alone by his false advisers he would be much better off than he now is, and Australia would not be suffering from much of its present unemployment. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline>also made a good deal of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> abolished the rural workers&#39; award when he came into power in Queensland. I point out that that was one of the undertakings given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> at the hustings. Is it not preferable that our jural workers should be engaged at a reasonable wage rather, than that they should- be idle, because of the inability of the farmers to pay the wages demanded under the rural award made during the regime of the McCormack Government? It was to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr- Moore&#39;s</inline> credit that he kept his promise, abolished the award, and so found employment for hundreds of unemployed in Queensland&#39;. </para>
          <para>Successive .attempts have been made by previous federal administrations to extend the industrial powers of the Commonwealth. Referendums were put before the people by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> in  1913,  the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes in  1922,  and the Bruce-Page Government in  1926.  On each occasion the proposals were rejected by the people. The main issue at the  1929  election was the distribution of industrial powers between the Commonwealth and the States. The proposals of the Bruce-Page Government were almost identical with those submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in  1922,  but because the Labour party persuaded the people that it was proposed to reduce wages and lower the standard of living, they were defeated. The proposals of the BrucePage Government, unlike those of this Government, clearly defined the respective spheres of the Commonwealth and State authorities. The Federal Court was to deal only with industries which were purely federal in their character, such as maritime industries and transport. All other matters were to be dealt with by the States. Had effect been given to those proposals, we should have got rid of that dual control which has caused so much trouble and loss to Australian industries. The referendum proposals in  1926  were an attempt to remove the hampering restrictions of dual control. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> then pointed out that it would be disastrous to the Commonwealth for the Federal Parliament to be constituted an industrial tribunal. He proposed to place the control of industrial matters in the hands of an outside body. It was then proposed to add a new paragraph to section  51  of the Constitution, to make it read - </para>

          <para class="block">That set out clearly that an outside body,  not the Federal Parliament, would have charge of industrial matters. The bill now before us vests those powers in Parliament itself. Instead of the Federal Parliament dealing only with industries of a federal character, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> proposed, the present Government would give it full power. The proposal before &#34;us will not do away with the overlapping which has prevailed for so many years. Realizing the evils of dual control, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> asked the State Premiers in  1929  to give to the Commonwealth Parliament full power in industrial matters,  but  they would not agree to his proposal. Thereupon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> proposed that the control of industry generally should be handed over to the States, reserving to the federal authority control of the maritime industry. The people rejected his proposal. I mention these things to show how different were the proposals of  1926  and  1929  from those of  the  present  Government.  This bill contains no evidence that the evil of dual control will be abolished; nor does it indicate what the Government proposes to do if vested with the additional power it seeks. All we are told is that the granting of these powers will remove the evils now existing in industry. I believe that the people would be prepared to give the Federal Parliament greater powers in certain specified matters of a purely federal nature, such as aviation, wireless,  and  the maritime industry, especially if those powers were to be exercised by a body outside Parliament. The bill, however, does not propose to vest these powers in an independent body; it proposes that Parliament itself shall deal with such matters as wages, hours of labour,  workers&#39; compensation, and early closing. Matters which are likely to cause a great deal of argument and dissension are far better left in the hands of an outside body, for differences would then be settled in a more friendly spirit than would be possible in a political atmosphere. If these matters are to be determined by Parliament, there is a danger that they will be decided, not on their merits, but according to the effect of a member&#39;s vote on his future political career. In the proposals submitted in 1926 the sphere in which the federal authority should arbitrate was clearly defined; but in this case it is somewhat obscure. Reference is made in the bill to the &#34; maintenance of industrial peace.&#34; That is a very elastic term. An industrial dispute of a federal character would come within the ambit of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and it would, I. submit, in certain circumstances be possible for a government so disposed to nationalize the industry in which the dispute occurred. As the socialization of all means of production, distribution and exchange has been a plank of the Labour party for many years, we should study this subject from that angle, and endeavour to determine the possibilities if such a policy should be adopted. If the Constitution Power of Amendment Bill is defeated, and this measure is passed by both branches of the legislature and accepted by the people, will the Commonwealth Arbitration Court be able to enforce a decision which is unfavorable to one party to a dispute more effectively than in the past? It is easy to enforce an award of the court which is acceptable to the workers ; but it is exceedingly difficult to do so when they are dissatisfied with its terms. Ample proof of that lias been forthcoming during the past eighteen months, when an award of the court was not acceptable to one of the parties to the dispute. &#34;Would the Commonwealth authorities call upon the State police to protect those working under an award of the court? If the Constitution Alteration Power of Amendment Bill is not passed, the Commonwealth Government will have to rely upon the States for assistance. I trust that this bill, which has such an important bearing on the industrial life of this country, will be carefully considered by the electors. I intend to vote against it, and to do all I can to influence those electors with whom I come in contact to register a vote in opposition to the Government&#39;s proposals. </para>

            <para>.- My attitude towards industrial arbitration is the same as it was 25 years ago. While I have always opposed dual industrial control, and have urged and supported the granting of exclusive industrial powers to the Commonwealth, I have at all times strongly objected to make Parliament an industrial authority. If this bill proposed to grant to the Commonwealth exclusive powers within certain limitations it would probably be more difficult for me to oppose it. But, as it does not seek to give those exclusive powers, but retains the dual industrial control which now exists, and suggests the undesirable and vicious, principle of parliamentary authority, no one can for a moment give it support. One wonders why the Government has introduced this measure in view of the fact that it has already submitted to Parliament a Constitution Power of Amendment Bill, which, if carried by both Houses and accepted by the people, would give it all the authority it required. Parliament, in its wisdom, could then legislate in whatever direction it desired, but I suppose the present Government has a fear that Parliament may not always be modelled on lines that would conform to the desires of the Labour party. I congratulate the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> upon the admirable speech, from his stand-point, which he delivered in introducing this measure; but he failed to deal effectively with the future policy of the Government in regard to arbitration. He was asked by interjection if the Government intended to&#39; extend its policy so that the services of State authorities could be availed of, and he replied that, possibly the Government might endeavour to do so. It would have been better had the Federal Government endeavoured to persuade the States to surrender their powers, so that the Commonwealth could exercise exclusive power in industrial matters. Can any one imagine a more unsuitable authority than a body of representative men sitting in judgment on industrial matters? In order to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation it might be well to cite one or two illustrations. For instance, one could not imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who urges that the worker is right on every occasion, giving an unbiased opinion. One has only to recall that during the timber-workers&#39; strike every member of the party now in office commended the action of the timberworkers and remained silent when acts of violence were committed. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> event went so far as to suggest as a solution of the problem that the present judges might be removed from office. I do not know whether that policy is being affirmed, but one judge has been promoted to another position. It shows, however, the unsuitability of this atmosphere for the settlement of industrial disputes. How could the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> whose business as a lawyer, I understand, consists largely of urging the claims of the workers, give an unbiased opinion on industrial matters? He would be in a very awkward position. Parliament as an industrial authority should be one of the last things to contemplate. This Parliament has a higher function to perform. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> said that in giving power to other authorities we would belittle our own status; but in my opinion it would belittle Parliament if its time were devoted to a discussion of wages and conditions of employment, which, although important, are not matters which this Parliament should determine. Parliamentarians who are responsible to the electors are unfitted to deal with industrial questions. The Labour party receives a good deal of its political support from trade unionists, and some sensible trade unionists vote for the Nationalist candidate, but Parliamentarians should not deal with industrial questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran&#39;s</inline> suggestion concerning the belittling of the status of this Parliament is not borne out by our past actions. Parliament has delegated its power with respect to tariff matters to a Tariff Board. Would the Minister or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> suggest that Parliament should concern itself with all the details of customs duties now dealt with by the Tariff Board? We should observe the same principle for the settlement of industrial disputes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The electors declared emphatically that the present arbitration act must stand. Every honorable senator on this side of the chamber accepts that verdict. I do, at all events. When this matter was under consideration by the Bruce-Page Government, I had to decide between the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court and the abolition of State arbitration machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes. In other words, I had to make up my mind on this question of dual control. I, and other members of the party to which I belong, were forced to the conclusion that if the States would not surrender their authority in industrial matters, the only course open to the Commonwealth was to retire from the field of arbitration. I believed then, and am still of the same opinion, that because of their inability to deal satisfactorily with industrial matters, eventually the States will be willing to surrender to the Commonwealth Parliament complete industrial power. However, we accept the decision of the people, but believe that the act should be improved so as to permit the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to function more efficiently. Parliament should not usurp the functions of that tribunal. The original draft of the Constitution limited the operation of the conciliation and arbitration system to disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. It is not difficult to imagine what was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution when they were considering this provision. Undoubtedly they believed that the machinery for the settlement of intrastate disputes should be under the jurisdiction of the States, and that legislation for the settlement of interstate disputes should be the responsibility of the Federal Government. Whether this particular provision in the Constitution is wise or otherwise is another matter. I believe it would have been better if responsibility for the settlement of industrial problems had been left entirely with the States, instead of the present system of dual control, which has involved industry in so many difficulties. According to a decision of the High Court the entire field of arbitration is open to the federal tribunal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said the other night that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court was restricted to interstate disputes. He knows better than I do that practically every industrial dispute can be made interstate in character by the simple process of serving a log upon the employers. I recall, and other honorable senators no doubt will also remember, how the Prime Minister of the day intervened in. the dispute in the coal-mining industry during the war. He requested a judge of the Arbitration Court to grant the demands of the coal-miners, and allow the coal mine-owners to increase the price of coal. Fortunately we had an arbitration judge who resented political interference and told the then Prime Minister to mind his own business. That incident brings into relief the evils of parliamentary interference with our arbitration tribunal, and it should emphasize the difficulties that are likely to be created if this constitutional amendment is endorsed by the people. This Parliament will then have the right to decide questions of hours of labour, wages paid in industry, and other industrial matters. Parliament will be turned into a veritable beargarden, for it will be continually fighting over these issues. </para>

          <para>What need is there for this amendment of the Constitution? Where is the unrest? In the main, the workers of the Commonwealth are enjoying decent conditions. With the exception of the United States of America, their wages are the highest in the world. I will not say that they have a higher standard of living than is enjoyed by the workers in the United States of America, who, I would remind the Senate, are not protected in any way by an arbitration tribunal. The industrial delegation which visited the United States of America in 1927, made some interesting comments on this phase of American industry in its report. It states on page 25 - </para>

            <para>An important part of the management ia the conduct of industrial relations between it and the working force, and it would appear that strikes and lockouts in manufacturing industries are diminishing. During the period of great advancement, say since 1922, disturbances in manufacture have not been great. </para>

          <para class="block">Although industry in the United States of America is not subject to compulsory arbitration awards or fixation of wages, the wages paid to the workers have increased very substantially. Taking 1.00  as the index figure in 1913, the uniform wage rate in the United States of America in 1920 was 199, and in 1926, it was 238. During this time also, prices of commodities declined. </para>

It is well to see how it operates for the time being ; I am afraid that for practical, as well as for legal purposes, if we made any distinction in regard to foreign companies, we should find ourselves in deep water, and I am not sure that it would not prove detrimental to Australia in the long run. </para>

          <para>. -  I do not seek to amend this clause because of any personal dislike for foreigners or racial feeling, but because I hold that there are already more than enough insurance companies operating in Australia and we know that the more companies there are operating the more the overhead expenses are and the more intense and unfair is the competition between the companies. It would be very much to the advantage of Australia if we had no additional life insurance concerns until our population had doubled or trebled.

          <para>.- I am very doubtful whether the proposed amendment would take us anywhere. The honorable senator suggests that we should make an exception of companies whose head office is in Great Britain. If that and his proposed subsequent amendment are carried, the effect will be that a foreign company other than one whose head office is in Great Britain will be compelled to pay a deposit of &#163;30,000 in respect of each class of insurance business that it proposes to carry on here, while there will be no provision for a company whose head office is in Great Britain to deposit anything. </para>

            <para>- That indicates the difficulty of dealing with a matter in this way. It also indicates that the committee should hearken to the advice that has been tendered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> who said that this was a dangerous thing with which to interfere. If the amendment is accepted, South Africa or any of the other dominions might take exception, and retaliate. Several big Australian mutual companies are carrying on business in various parts of the British Empire: in South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, and even Ceylon. I believe that if we accepted the amendment we should be on dangerous ground. </para>

          <para>. -  I recall to the minds of honorable senators an earlier discussion that we had on this clause. I believe that I then intimated that the very point now raised was the subject of an inquiry by a commission in Great Britain.  That commission decided that it was better, in the interests of everybody concerned, to leave well alone, and they did not go to the lengths that we have gone in this measure. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newlands</inline> pointed out, these companies would have to deposit &#163;30.000 in respect of each class of business they proposed to carry on in Australia. I do not think that we should discriminate against any country. I suggest to honorable senators that Ave should not involve ourselves in a controversial issue of this character, which may give rise to very great difficulty and re-act to the detriment of our own companies carrying on business outside Australia. </para>

I ask honorable senators is it not a fact that when we give preferential duties to Great Britain we do not give them to other portions of the British Empire? If we do, thatis a separate provision altogether. </para>

A foreign company coming here would most likely cater for different classes of business. &#34;We should not do anything which would tend to keep out of this country persons who wish to engage in business here. We are getting too much into the habit of thinking only of ourselves. Honorable senators seem to be afraid that some of the profits of these companies will be sent to another country. Would it be a serious matter if a little money from Australia were sent to England or Canada? Foreign insurance companies should not be treated in the way that is proposed.

          <para>. - When this bill was under consideration previously I suggested that an amendment should be made to meet, for instance, the case of an insurance agent who canvasses oldage pensioners. Numbers of such cases have come before me professionally, and I should like to give one example to the committee. At Gawler, in South Australia, two old-age pensioners were approached by an insurance agent, who told them that for 6d. a week each his company would provide them with &#163;12 at death, which, he said, would be sufficient to meet their funeral expenses. Each of them took out a policy. Four or five years later the husband was taken ill, and it was discovered that he had a cancer. Soon afterwards the insurance agent visited the house, and, after expressing his sympathy with the unfortunate man suggested that, in view of the increased cost of burials, it would be wise for him to take out a fresh policy for &#163;15, which could be done by the payment of an extra 2d. a week.  His  advice was accepted. The original policy was cancelled, and a new policy, based on a proposal which contained a declaration that the man was in good health, was issued. On the death of the man his representative approached the company when it was discovered that there had clearly been misrepresentation, and the only amount refunded was that which had been paid in respect of premiums on the second policy. The payments on the first policy, extending over several years, went for nought. The amendment, I suggest, is that inthe case of policies of &#163;100 and under - on policies over that amount the companies insist on a medical examination - the fact that the insured was in good health when accepted should be conclusive evidence. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that as in the case of policies of over &#163;100 the companies protect themselves against risk by insisting on a medical examination; in the case of policies of &#163;100 and under, they should not accept the premiums of the person insured, who takes all the risk as to whether the money will actually be paid, unless they are prepared to pay the amount they undertake to pay. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> is of the opinion that the amendment made last week to meet my suggestion might come into conflict with certain legal doctrines and raise a question of doubt concerning policies in excess of &#163;100, but that he has an amendment which will overcome the difficulty and protect those whom I am anxious &#39;to assist. </para>

          <para>. - I  am  not quite  clear whether  proof of age other than an actual birth certificate is provided for in this or subsequent clauses. Many cases have been brought under my notice, particularly in connexion with invalid and old-age pensions, where it was practically impossible to obtain certificates of birth of persons born many years ago. Before the present law for compulsory registration in Great Britain was in force, the parish register was the only form of birth registration, and in many cases it was quite impossible to obtain reliable proof of age. Applicants for pensions can be brought before  a  stipendiary magistrate who, if satisfied, from the appearance of the applicant, and other corroborative evidence, will accept the age given by the applicant. It is infinitely easier to obtain proof of age before death. Is any documentary proof necessary prior to death? </para>

I produced my baptismal certificate, which most people obtain at some time or another, and also a bible containing a record of the ages of the members of the family. Both were accepted and my age having once been properly recorded I have had no difficulty in connexion with subsequent policies. </para>

          <para>. -  A case somewhat similar to the experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> came under my notice a few years ago when an applicant for the old-age pension asked me to assist him to establish his claim. It appears that he was born in Dublin, but both parents died whilst he was still of tender age, and he was placed under the care of a relative in another county. He was living in the county of Cork when he left Ireland to come to Australia. I wrote to the head of the church to which he belongs and in due time received a reply from the secretary to the archbishop of the diocese advising me that there were nine parishes in Dublin and that the authorities in each parish charged a search fee of 5s., so I took no further action in that direction. Subsequently I took the man to Parramatta and was able to certify that I had known him for over 30 years, and that when first I knew him he was an elderly man. My statement was taken as corroborative evidence, and the magistrate certified that the applicant was of an age to qualify for the old-age pension. Although the system of registration of births has been in force for many years, there are still some remote places in Australia where registration is neglected. One of my own sons was not registered until he was about six or seven years of age. I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan&#39;s</inline> assurance that the bill contains the necessary provision to enable an insured person to prove age during his lifetime, and in that way to prevent trouble from arising after death. </para>

I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> is interested in the business of life insurance and naturally he is anxious that all avenues should be open to the various companies. It has been well said that you cannot make people virtuous by act of Parliament, but an eminent statesman has reminded us that Parliament can make it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong. I see no reason why we should reverse our decision of Friday last. I am aware that a considerable amount of industrial business is done by the various companies, but unfortunately it is a wasteful form of insurance, find I do not know that we should encourage it. The overhead charge is so enormous that this form of insurance is of little value to the community. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> say whether there is any limit to the amount of insurance which may be effected under an industrial policy? </para>

            <para>- I know that the amounts are small and I should like to know if the honorable senator will accept a definite limitation in the proviso he has expressed his willingness to insert. I think we should have such a limitation. Otherwise there would be a temptation to women to make use of this power to insure the lives of their husbands. </para>

          <para>.-I trust that the amendment will not be pressed, because I am opposed to the issue of policies without the consent of husband and wife. After the death of the assured there is a great deal of detail to be cleared up in connexion with industrial policies. Conclusive proof that the party assured has been a member of a particular company must be furnished by some one other than a relative of the deceased, but as people do not usually go round advertising that they have insured for &#163;20 or &#163;50 under an industrial policy, it is often difficult for the company to secure the required proof. Many representatives of companies paint rosy and glowing pictures of the benefits to be derived by insuring in their companies. In some cases people are deliberately misled into paying premiums, and it is not long before they find they are not entitled to all that the agents have promised. Insurers should thoroughly understand the position before policies are foisted upon them, and there should be no secrecy about the matter. For that reason I hope the amendment will not be pressed. </para>

          <para>. - This clause is taken from the State laws of Victoria, South Australia and various other States, where it has been in operation for years without any dreadful calamities arising out of it, except in the two instances mentioned on Friday last, both of which concerned life, and not industrial, policies. The woman is very often the best judge. I am willing to accept an amendment later on to limit the amount of the policy. I feel, however, that something should be done to safeguard the wife. It is useless to go over the ground I have already put to honorable senators, but the wife is often obliged to take out an industrial policy on the life of an undesirable husband,  for the sake of herself and her family. I am prepared to add the following proviso to the clause - </para>

          <para>.- I hope that honorable senators will see their way to accept the proposal now made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan.</inline> Where a medical examination is required the husband, of course, automatically gives his consent to a policy being taken out on his life for the benefit of his wife, but many insurance companies allow women to take out small industrial policies on the lives  of  their husbands and the latter may know nothing about them. It is done as a protection to families if disaster should overtake the bread-winners. I should like to draw the attention of the committee to the following letter which appeared recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald :  -</inline> &#34;Two Eleven&#34; writes:- </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline>In the Herald report . 17-5-30, appears the following: &#34;Objection was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> to clause 18, sub-clause 1, which states : &#39; A married woman may effect a policy for her separate use on the life of her husband.&#39; He proposed, as an amendment the addition of the words &#39; with his consent.&#39; This amendment was agreed to by sixteen votes to five. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in supporting the amendment, pointed out that cases had occurred in which persons had insured the lives of near relatives with sinister motives, and cited a recent murder in England in support of his point.&#34; The major part of insurance effected in this direction is for very small amounts only on each life, the maximum being only sufficient to carry over a time of stress, pay funeral expenses, and perhaps leave a small margin to allowa woman time to adjust herself to the position to be faced when deprived of her husband. To the man with a sense of responsibility, his insurance premium is regarded in the light of a good investment, and a necessary protection. To the thoughtless and the thriftless, these matters are left to providence, the manifestation in these cases working in the matter by the wife taking this duty upon herself. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had very little idea how much those three small words of hisamendment means for the future widows of the Commonwealth, and it certainly seems that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could really be aware of the class of business he was wiping out when he cited the recent murder in England in support of his point. As an industrial agent I hope this clause may be allowed to remain in the form as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> amendment dropped on the third reading. </para>

        <para class="block">It is ridiculous to suggest that a married woman may take out a policy for  an  amount not exceeding &#163;100 with some sinister design on the life or well-being of her husband. Such a policy is taken out only as an act of safety, frugality and thrift; and for all the reasons so strongly and eloquently urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> I suggest that honorable senators should agree to the amendment. They can do so with perfect safety having regard to the promise the honorable senator who is in charge of the bill has made, that in a proviso he will make ample provision against any wrong-doing or evil design. It is I think, in the interests of the home, the wife and family that these policies are taken out and I am sure that honorable senators who have opposed the amendment now before the committee will hearken to the pathetic appeal made to them in the letter I have just read. At any rate I trust that it will have the necessary influence to induce them to accept the compromise offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan.</inline></para>

          <para>. -  Clause 81  is  taken from State legislation with regard to the protection of policies from creditors. Part of that State legislation provides that a married woman may effect a policy upon her own life or upon the life of her husband for her separate use. The question of a medical examination or no medical examination does not arise at this stage. It is simply a question of having legal protection thrown round the policy. But if the words &#34; with his consent &#34; are retained the power of the married woman to effect an insurance on the life of her husband is limited. The proviso I have suggested should meet the ease. </para>

            <para>- She could not be prevented from insuringher husband&#39;s life unless a prohibitory clause were inserted. An examination of sub-clause 3 makes the position plain. As we are attempting to consolidate insurance laws we should be very careful that we do not include anything in this measure that may be criticized by somebody higher than an anonymous insurance agent. This clause says that a woman can insure her own life or that of her husband for her separate use. I. think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> will agree that the latest judicial decisions go to show that the clause is really not necessary. In any case, it is simply declaratory, to obviate litigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> amendment would not overcome the difficulty that he visualizes. A married woman could still insure her husband&#39;s life, but if he died insolvent it would be possible for the official receiver to collect the benefit that would otherwise accrue to the wife. If the honorable senator is out to protect the widow it will be better for him to allow the clause to stand in its original form. </para>

            <para>- Could it not be provided that if a company issued a policy in contravention of the clause it should be fined &#163;50, or any other sum that was desired? I am just as anxious as anybody else to give to a woman who is cursed with a drunkard or a waster as a husband, the opportunity to obtain a few pounds in the event of his death. It really would not matter much if the cover induced her to shuffle him off this mortal coil. But in view of the possibility of the criminal-minded person misusing the powers of insurance, it is necessary to provide a safeguard. I recall the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Needle,</inline> in Victoria, who poisoned her two young children in order to obtain the insurance money. One would not think it possible that anybody could be guilty of such callous brutality. That woman was also supposed to have poisoned her own husband, and it was alleged that she tried to poison her brother-in-law, in order to collect the insurances. It is necessary to provide a safeguard against that sort of thing. Perhaps the acceptance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan&#39;s</inline> proposal would confer the advantage that he claims, because both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> tell us that the clause provides no protection whatever. If that is so, what isthe use of the amendment with which the honorable senator is trying to fool me? Is it fair that he should trade on his legal knowledge and press me with an amendment which is as valueless as my original one is now said to be. </para>

            <para>- I am a layman and like to see things plainly in writing. I do not see why the words &#34; with his consent &#34; should not be retained. We have all frequently heard of cases where wives have run up bills against their husbands, and so caused domestic trouble. The clause without these words will cause domestic trouble. Troubles of that kind are usually caused by a wife doing these things without her husband&#39;s knowledge.

I thought that its purpose was to give a married woman the right to insure her husband ; but I now find that its object is to give her an interest in any policy that is taken out by her. All along she has had the right to insure her husband. No objection would have been taken to the clause if it had read - </para>

          <para>. -  We might overcome the difficulty by allowing the clause to remain in its present form and adding a new clause along the lines of the proviso suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan.</inline> That would mean the re-committal of the bill for the purpose of inserting a clause to meet the case of policies taken out by a wife on the life of her husband without his consent. When a man marries a woman he takes her forbetter or for worse. It is true that there are isolated cases of domestic unhappiness; but I take it that the desire of honorable senators is not to meet such cases, but to protect women against insurance agents, who, like hawkers and peddlers, want to sell them something. When a woman incurs indebtedness without the consent of her husband, it is generally the husband who pays. The suggested amendment, instead of protecting -women in the way desired by honorable senators, will give insurance companies a means of evading payment on any policy taken out without the husband&#39;s consent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> acknowledged the principle in the amendment he suggested. There should be a new clause to protect a woman against an insurance agent who makes false representations to her. Some insurance policies contain the question &#34; Are you of temperate habits &#34; ? In th&#171; case of a policy taken out by a wife on the life of her husband, the question reads, &#34;Is your husband of temperate habits&#34;? A wife who takes out a policy on the life of her husband who is  a  heavy drinker and answers that question in the affirmative, runs the risk of getting nothing from the company in the event of his death. I suggest that we allow the clause to pass on the understanding that it will be re-committed to meet the cases mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae.</inline></para>

          <para>. -  Life insurance is one of the most important institutions of the present day. In connexion with this clause several conflicting problems arise. First, there is the worthless man whose wife desires to insure his life in order that she may have a few pounds in the event of his death. Then there is the unscrupulous woman who is prepared to insure her husband and then to get rid of him. There is also the woman who is not game to tell her husband what she does, but behind his back takes out an insurance policy and finds out after she has paid a fewpremiums that she has been told a lot of lies. The premiums are not kept paid up unless the husband pays them. I realize that there is the case of the surly husband who will not readily give his consent to his wife&#39;s request to insure his life. We must leave it to the wife to gain his consent. Most women can find a way of doing so. There is something in the contention that if a woman may- insure her husband only with his written consent, a company which issues a policy without the husband&#39;s consent, is guilty of an offence. In order to make the position clear, we should insert a clause to make it an offence on the part of a company to insure any person without his consent. I do not want to con&#39;fine the restriction to wives and husbands. No person should insure any other person without that person&#39;s consent. There may be women who would be prepared to do away with their husbands if they were insured for a substantial amount; but no woman would <inline font-style="italic">\e</inline> likely to do away with her husband for less than &#163;100. There should be a proper understanding between husband and wife before either of  them enters  into a transaction which will involve the other financially. It is immaterial whether the amount is &#163;50 or &#163;50,000. We should not lightly disturb the decision we arrived at last week. </para>

          <para>. -  At the moment I am not quite clear as to the actual .effect of such a provision. Contractual relations between husband -and wife involve principles of general law. I doubt if it is within the competence of this committee to make the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in this bill. Insurances under this clause are effected generally on the payments made by women out of their housekeeping money, and usually by wives who wish to protect themselves against a rainy day. The Parliamentary Draftsman could consider, the suggested amendment and if considered practicable, it could be moved in another place. </para>

            <para>- By doing so, we might be giving a wrong lead. I do not think that the providence of a wife should be affected by the consent of the husband. I suggest that honorable senators should allow the clause to stand in its original form on the understanding that I will see if a suitable amendment can be framed, and if necessary, again recommit the bill. I am sure the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> must have some doubt concerning the effect of the suggested amendment upon the rights now existing as between husband and wife. There is also the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays as to its effect upon the insurance of children. If the words &#34; without his consent &#34; are allowed to remain, the position of the wife will become somewhat insecure. </para>

          <para>. -  On  a  previous occasion, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> raised the point of the contractual relations between the insurance company and the person insured, he argued the merits of the proposal. I am surprised that  a  legal man should have led laymen into this trap. If the honorable senator understood the legal significance of his own bill, he should have put before us last week the objection he now takes to the retention of these words. As the words have been inserted, I am not willing to allow them to be deleted unless they are to be inserted somewhere else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> is asking us to revert to the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> and that I am prepared to do, if he means the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> of last week. On the previous occasion when he accepted defeat he did not say that he would move for the recommittal of the clause. He then accepted the decision of the committee which was substantial and determined, but he comes forward with this new idea to blow it out. The honorable senator suggested that my amendment, if practicable, could be- inserted in another place; but I contend that the clause should be left as it is and that if my proposal is found to be impracticable an amendment can be moved in another place. Why should the onus of proving that the words, &#34; with his consent &#34; are in the right place, be thrown upon this side of the chamber. Let the onus be thrown upon those who &#34; bungled the show.&#34; The committee, by a large majority, placed these words in the bill, and if in consequence of a mistake on the part of the senator in charge of the measure it is in the wrong place, he should arrange for it to be put in its proper position when the bill is before another place. </para>

We need not wait until the measure is before another place to make the further amendment which has been suggested ; the clause oan be passed in its present form and when the report stage is reached, a motioncan be moved for the recommittal of the bill for the deliberate purpose of inserting the provision mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> can convince the majority of the committee that such a revolution in the insurance law will take place, I shall have to consider whether it is desirable to take the bill any further. The whole principle of the insurable interest is involved. I shall offer no objection if the majority of honorable senators favours the re-committal of the bill for the purpose of discussing the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> but I must have an opportunity to consider the effect of any such alteration of the insurance law as I understand it.My only desire is to have as perfect a piece of legislation as it is possible to get.

Consequential amendments will stipulate that the assignment shall be registered by being left in duplicate with the policy at the office of the company in the State or territory in which the policy is registered, and the secretary shall retain the duplicate of the assignment in the office of the company and return the policy with the endorsement thereon signed by himself and the assignment to the person leaving it.

        <para class="block">Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newlands</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made some strong observations with regard to the practice obtaining in certain localities of agents urging persons to insure in one company, and, having induced&#39; them to do so, representing a little later that some other company was a much sounder concern, with the result that they forfeited their policies and the agents secured another commission asthe outcome of their insuring with the second company. The Crown Law officers have had this matter under consideration for some time, and the only suggestion theycan offer is to insert a provision making it a criminal offence for any person to utter false statements concerning any insurance company. They realize the difficulty of proving that any person knowingly makes a false statement, but this new provision will, at all events, be a label, and it may be a deterrent. </para>
        <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) &#91;10.30&#93;.  -  The committee might as well accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan&#39;s</inline> amendment, although I do not think itwill do much good, because it is absolutely impossible to get honesty into commerce. Commercial transactions are honeycombed with roguery and misrepresentation. The difficulty is to catch the offender. It is a case of the old story about jugged hare. You must first catch the hare. Misrepresentation may be done in such a way that it is very difficult to sheet home the offence. It is a strong argument for the abolition of all insurance companies except one socialized concern. Insurance companies may be competing with one another, but all are in unison in one respect, and that is to take down the public. </para>

            <para>- But even if it is a false statement, where will the new clause take us ? Beyond the common law? What additional protection does it give to the insurance company or any one else? Surely the common law is sufficient to deal with matters of this kind. </para>

          <para>. -  It is a kind of criminal libel if an agent knowingly makes a false statement in regard to an insurance company, but I doubt whether any State law would apply to a false statement made by an agent in comparing the position of two insurance companies. </para>

            <para>- Yes, if he knowingly makes a false statement concerning a company. In such circumstances I think he should be punished. It is the evil about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newlands</inline> and SenatorRae were complaining. While I recognize the inefficacy in practice of what is proposed to be done, be cause there are methods of defaming insurance companies that will not lend themselves to successful prosecution, I think the least we can do is to make some gesture for the protection of these companies who do not want their agents to do that sort of thing. </para>

          <para>.- On Friday my attention was drawn to the words &#34;providing for the application of this act, with such modifications as are necessary, to persons, firms or associations &#34;. The bill does not contemplate persons, firms or associations engaging in the insurance business, and therefore, having consulted the Parliamentary Draftsman on the matter, I propose to ask the committee to eliminate the words. I move - </para>
