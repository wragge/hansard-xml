The Standing Orders and authorities on parliamentary procedure are very explicit that questions may be asked only for the purpose of obtaining information, that no implications and, as far as possible, no suggestions may be admitted into them; and that the information sought should be information which, in the ordinary course of parliamentary business, is likely to prove useful in debate. </para>

So ingenious was the evasion of the law of libel that the Ministers concerned had no opportunity to clear their characters, but I am instructed by them to say that if the newspaper will be fair enough to state the facts upon which it allegedly bases its conclusion, they will take the necessary steps to protect their honour and the dignity attaching to the holders of Ministerial portfolios: There  will be no need to wait for the appointment of a royal commission, which, by interjection, one honorable senator has suggested should be appointed. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia) [11.18]. - Although this is a measure that can be more effectively debated in committee, I wish to give the Leader of the Government in the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline>
                    an opportunity to obtain answers to some questions which may he raised during the second-reading debate. The first point which I wish to bring before the Minister is this : There are certain retrospective provisions in this measure and in the Land Tax Assessment Bill recently passed, and the explanation given was that these retrospective provisions were necessary in order to safeguard the departmental position in regard to taxation not yet collected. I should like to know if the Government will give an assurance that these retrospective provisions will not be used to re-open settled assessments. That question is creating a good deal of interest.

                <para>The crux of the bill is clause 2 in which apparently an endeavour has been made to meet the objections raised in the Senate concerning the definition of " improvements." What we need to concern ourselves with is whether the Government in this amending measure has met the criticisms which were then offered in that regard. There are two points to which I particularly wish to direct the attention of the Senate. The first relates to the definition of " value of improvements " -  " Value of improvements " in relation to land means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this Act irrespective of the cost of improvements including in such added value the value of any hotel licence or other similar interest the value of which has been included in the improved value. </para>
                <para class="block">As I read that it means that the value of an hotel licence or any similar interest is excluded from the taxable value. I should like the Minister to say whether that is the correct reading of the definition. It is somewhat obscure, but that is how I believe the Government is meeting the criticisms in regard to cases of that kind. The second point to which I wish to direct special attention relates to the proviso to paragraph c of clause 2 which reads: </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Provided that the added value shall in no case exceed the amount that should reasonably be involved in effecting, at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this Act improvements of a nature and efficiency equivalent to the existing improvements. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It may be that that proviso does not mean what I think it means, but the object of my remarks at this stage is to give the Minister an opportunity of looking into the matter and of later informing the Senate what it actually does mean. For the purpose of making my point clear I may cite two illustrations. Take the case of town lands. An area of land adjacent to a township is opened up for sale in subdivisional lots. Let us say the value of that land is £2,000, but the owner, in order to facilitate its sale expends £2,000 in constructing roads. The additional value given to the land for sale purposes, by the construction of these roads, is, say, £4,000, so that the selling value of the land is £6,000. Upon what value is the area to be taxed? Is it to be taxed upon the value of the land, £2,000, or is the taxable value £2,000 plus not only the £2,000 spent in the construction of roads, but the added value given to the land by such road construction ? It is clear to my mind that the construction of these roads would be an " improvement." and if we tax the value given to the land by the construction of roads by the owner we are taxing his improvements. It seems to me that the proviso makes it possible for the department to tax in that case not only the £2,000, the value of the land, hut that £2,000, plUs the £2,000 added value given by the construction of the roads, and even <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> add <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> that the actual cost of the construction of the roads, thus taxing the owner on a value of £6,000. That is a construction which I think it is possible to place upon that provision and I should like to know whether my contention is right. The second illustration which I wish to cite is in connexion with agricultural lands. Let ns assume that a person owns 1,000 acres of land which possesses little or no unimproved value. The person who buys that land or who takes it up may spend, say, £2,000 in fencing and providing water supply or improvements of that nature to give it a productive value. The cost of the improvements that the owner places upon the land let us assume is £2,000; but in spending that amount he gives to the land a productive value which it did not possess before. Thai productive value may be more than £2,000- it may be £4,000. As I read the proviso all that such a person could deduct would be the actual value of the improvements that he had placed upon the land, namely £2,000, but he would be taxed upon the value that is given to the land by placing these improvements upon it, which might be double their actual cost. When I was speaking on the first Land Tax Assessment Bill, introduced a week or two ago, I said that there was a very clear principle in relation to the taxation of the unimproved value of land. There are two values: There is the value given to land by the energy, enterprise and activity of the owner, and the value given to it by the presence and needs of the community. I can illustrate those two different values in this way: In the first case that I cited A has 1,000 acres of land which is within ten miles of a township, a railway and other amenities of civilization. On the other hand B owns a block of equal .value, from a productive viewpoint, but 60 miles from a township or a railway. Both A and B spend the same amount of money in improvements, but it is obvious that there is a value in the case of the land owned by A which does not exist in the cas,e of the land owned by B. That value in the case of the land owned by A is the value given by the presence and needs of the community. This is called the unearned increment, and is the value that is always regarded by those who advocate the taxation of unimproved land values as a fair basis of taxation. That, however, is not the value that is created by the enterprise or activities of the owner, but by the presence and needs of the community. It appears to me that this amended proviso  departs from that principle and that the department in framing these amendments is endeavouring to tax not only the value created by the presence and needs of the community, but also the value that is given to the land by the enterprise and activity of the owner of the land in improving it. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It should not be included in any law which professes to tax the unimproved value of land. But if my reading of the bill, particularly the proviso, is correct, that is what is being done. It is clear that the cost to the owner of putting visible improvements on the land is being deducted, but the words "or pertaining thereto" might mean improvements not actually on the land. The Senate's objection in that respect has been met. Nevertheless, I believe that the department will still be able to tax that value given to the land which is in excess of the cost of the improvements, but which is the result of such improvements. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> will let us know the Government's view on the point I have raised, it might help us in determining our attitude towards this clause. Any further remarks I have to make regarding the bill will be more appropriately made in committee. I hope that honorable senators will give close attention to Statutory Rule No. 33, which was laid on the table of the Senate yesterday. It is an important regulation dealing with the taxation of Crown leases. As a layman I find it difficult to understand the regulation. Perhaps the Minister in charge of the bill will be able to explain its exact effect. The bill now before us makes that statutory rule retrospective in its application. I should like to know whether it will -be retrospective in its application in regard only to taxes outstanding, or whether it will bo retrospective in its application to assessments that have been made and settled. We should know whether all earlier assessments will be reopened, or whether the statutory rule will apply only to outstanding taxes. </para>

                    COLEBATCH (Western Australia)  [11.33]. - I  am afraid  that I cannot accept the suggestion qf the Leader of the Senate that this is a  bill  for consideration in committee.  We  have, first, to decide the principle underlying the measure, and satisfy ourselves that a sufficient reason exists for altering the present act. I am not satisfied that good reasons do exist for the alteration. Such inquiries as I have been able to make in the limited time available have confirmed me in the view that there is no need to alter the present legislation. I should be the last to suggest that the Leader of the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline>
                    had any desire to mislead the Senate, but I certainly was misled by some of his remarks. Honorable senators will recollect that the Minister referred more than once to land which had a value of £10 an acre, but which would decline in value to £9 an acre unless something was done to maintain it at its original value.  His  repeated reference to land worth £10 an acre led me to believe that the matter which had induced the Government to introduce this amending legislation had reference to land worth approximately £10 an acre. But the case which was decided by the High Court which led to the introduction of this legislation related to land the full improved value of which was only £1 14s. 3d. au acre. The land in question comprised an area of 12,973 acres, the fair selling price of which, with all improvements, was £22,250. Included in that valuation were the following items - the amounts are approximate : - Water supply, £3,000; buildings, £720; fencing, £2,000; timber treatment, £5,000. Before we can consider the cost of clearing the land, and eradicating the prickly pear, approximately 17s. an acre must be deducted for visible improvements, thus bringing the value of the land down to 17s. 3d. an acre. In addition, a deduction must be made in respect of invisible improvements - what it costs to eradicate the prickly pear and make the land useful. I know nothing about the cost of clearing prickly pear, but I do know that agricultural land in Western Australia, valued at £1 14s. 3d. an acre, including visible improvements worth 17s. an acre, would be worth not more than 5s. or 6s.  an acre in its unimproved state, even giving it all the advantages of proximity to railways or other facilities. "When Parliament fixed a minimum of £5,000 it never intended to tax land of that value.
                </para>
                <para>The second point I desire to submit is that the High Court decided this question on what it conceived to be the principles which guided Parliament in imposing land taxation. Three judges held one view and one judge a different view. T do not suggest that the Senate should concern itself with determining which view was right in point of law; but it is competent to decide which view represented the intention of Parliament when it imposed legislation for the taxation of unimproved land values. The view of the judge who first heard the case - a view confirmed by a majority of the High Court - was expressed by the late Chief Justice of the High Court in the following terms : -  in thu legislation in Australia imposing tax on the unimproved value oE land we think it is clear that the subject matter sought to be taxed has always been that part of the value of the land at the relevant date which has been commonly described as the "unearned inclement." The value at any given date of any given parcel of land has been considered as including two factors, viz. - (I) The portion of the value at the relevant date attributable to improvements on or appertaining to the land made by the owner or his predecessors in title; mid (2) the portion of the value at such date attributable to extrinsic circumstances such as public roads or railways, increased settlement in the neighbourhood, public services brought within reach, and other causes not brought about by the operations on the land of successive occupiers . . . </para>
                <para class="block">We think the unimproved value which is the subject of taxation under this act is the value at the relevant date of the land in its natural state as for the time being affected by extrinsic circumstances of every kind, as for example those above-mentioned, but not by what has been done to it or upon it in the shape of improvements of any kind effected by the operations of successive owners the benefit of which continues as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> factor in the then present value of the land. </para>
                <para class="block">I maintain that that is an accurate statement of the policy of Parliament in imposing a tax on unimproved land values. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not know that Parliament when imposing this land tax had any idea of the statutory measure of the owner's pecuniary capacity to contribute to the present needs of government. If that is to be the basis of valuation, the Government would not be justified, in the present state of our primary industries, in expecting to receive any considerable revenue from the taxation of land. We have, therefore, as the basis of this legislation, a conflict between two opinions, not as to the legal interpretation of a section of an act of Parliament, but as to the intention of Parliament when the legislation was passed. Whatever its legal value, there can be little doubt that the majority view is the correct interpretation of the will of Parliament. Seeing that the act in its present form carries out that intention, it should not be altered. My inclination is to vote against the second reading of the bill; but I shall not do so if the Minister in charge of it will agree to allow the committee stage to be held over until after the Easter vacation, so that honorable senators may give the matter full consideration. If he is not prepared to do that, I shall oppose the second reading, for I do not see how it is possible for honorable senators in the limited time at their disposal, especially in view of the necessity to refer the bill again to another place, to give it full and proper consideration. </para>
                <para>The wording of the measure is the most extraordinary that I have ever come across. When the bill was previously before the Senate I drew attention to three words that were tediously repeated, and I was informed that they were employed to give the phraseology its necessary legal import. I invite  honorable  senators to examine the proviso in paragraph ?; of the proposed amendment to section 3 of the principal act. There they will find the words - the value of improvements from the improved value at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act. "As at which!" Why should not the simple words. " the value of the improvements from the improved value at the time the value is required to be ascertained," suffice? I doubt whether any legal mind could torture them into anything other than they are intended to mean. To me the words " as at which " are pure jargon, and mean nothing at all. It is recognized to be extremely dangerous to put into an act of Parliament, words that have no meaning. If the words " as at which " have any meaning, I ask the Leader of the Government to explain what it is, and not to put honorable senators off with a statement that they are necessary legal phraseology. I have searched the whole of the land tax acts of this country and of New Zealand, and have been unable to find a similar expression in any one of them. I do not know that, as a result, they have been defective. Honorable senators will find in. the paragraph dealing with the definition of " taxpayer " the words, " includes all such destruction of suckers and seedlings"- </para>

The use of those words appears to mc to be dangerous. Again, in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c}</inline> which defines "value of improvements," I find words which, to my mind, arc meaningless. They are, " irrespective of the cost of the improvements." It has already been suggested that "value "of improvements " means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the time of the valuation. How can the cost of those improvements possibly enter into the matter? There are other words which are most dangerously used, in my opinion. If they have any meaning it is one which I cannot understand, a meaning into which the court might be <inline font-style="italic">asked</inline> to read anything. I refer to the words - irrespective of the cost of the improvements, including in such added value the value of any hotel licence or other similar interest the value of which  has  been included in the improved vallue. </para>

                    <para>I suggest to the Leader of the Senate that the bill is not sufficiently perfect to justify his rushing it through. The Senate would be lacking in its duty if it permitted the proposed amendment of section 3 of the principal act to go through in its present form.

It should be the endeavour of the Government to encourage people to increase the carrying capacity and productivity of their land, as such improvements must inevitably result in the engagement of additional labour to carry out the work. However, it appears to me that this bill will penalize the progressive individual. As was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> if a man increased the value of his land by from £3 to £4 an acre, he would subject himself to excessive taxation because of his effort and forethought, as he would probably be assessed on the increased value of the land. So far as I can see, provision is made for the deduction only of visible improvements. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that that was not the original intention of Parliament when it imposed a tax upon unimproved land values. I believe that the drafting of the measure is unsound and dangerous. Unless the Leader of the Senate can satisfy me that invisible as well as visible improvements are to be deducted from the improved value for taxation purposes, I am determined to vote against the bill as it is now drafted. </para>

Taxpayers have to provide the revenue necessary for the carrying out of the functions of government. If any specific class of taxpayer is allowed to escape from the general liability to pay taxation an added burden is imposed upon the shoulders of those called upon to bear taxation. Admitting that the principle of taxation of unimproved land is sound, it is a fair thing that everybody owning land which comes within the scope of the act should be compelled to pay his equitable share of taxation on the income expected to be derived from that land, and that nobody should be permitted to escape paying any portion, of his taxation. By the most eminent authorities, the Government was' advised that certain loopholes existed in the law as it stood, which assisted taxpayers to escape their proper payment of "taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with general principles. I am directing the minds of honorable senators to the bill as it stands, and calling attention to the duty of the Senate towards the Government on this specific measure. The fears entertained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> may or may not be well grounded, but the proper time to debate them is when the committee stage of the bill is reached. This measure purports to do nothing more than to prevent anybody from evading the principle of the payment of taxation on unimproved land values. It is simply an amendment of the principal act dealing with that principle which has not. I believe, been attacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole?</inline> batch in connexion with this bill. The bill simply deals with certain definitions, and also regulations and statutory rules. </para>

It does not introduce any new principle of taxation. To meet the objection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as to the policy of the department I can give the right honorable senator an assurance that these amending provisions are intended to clarify the law and make it possible for the department to deal with outstanding assessments. No part of this bill and no part of the rules will be applied to assessments that have been paid. The position is simply this: that through no fault of our own a dispute has arisen as to the liability of certain taxpayers to the Government on the question of taxation and this bill will clarify the matter and prevent further litigation involving heavy cost to both the Government and litigants. We believe that this measure contains the right basis of calculation and clearly defines what was in the minds of honorable senators when we discussed this subject a few days ago. If there is still doubt about the meaning of the verbiage of the bill I shall give careful consideration to any suggestions that may be made in committee. </para>

Honor- , able senators will have all day and tomorrow, if necessary, and as the Government has no other important business to submit this week, surely it should be possible for the Senate to dispose of this legislation before the Easter vacation. </para>

                        <para>1  11.13]. - I did not intend to speak upon this paragraph of the definition, but in view of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> has said perhaps it is desirable that I should do so. All that the Government is attempting to do is to enumerate the different classes of improvements concerning which honorable senators expressed doubt as to whether they would be covered by a provision in general terms. There is a specific reference to classes of improvements. This plan has been followed for a specific purpose. Honorable senators will notice that the definition is inclusive, but not exclusive. The department does not admit the necessity for enumerating all the various classes of improvements. Counsel, to whom the bill was submitted, took the same view, but the Government believes that, in its present form, the paragraph will make clear the intention of the department. If honorable senators believe that other classes of improvements should be specifically defined so as to remove any doubt as to the attitude of the department, I am prepared to give consideration to any suggestions that may be made. At times we are inclined to confuse matters by the continued use of the word "deduction." The question is asked whether taxpayers will be allowed to deduct such and such costs as an improvement. But it is not a deduction in the true sense of the term. It is an attempt to ascertain the basis upon which the assessment should be made, and the cost of the improvement enters into consideration only when the value of the improvement to the land has been decided. If a man with a farm costing £1,000 provides a dam at a cost of £400, which serves to increase the unimproved value of the land by only £200, obviously the unimproved value of the land for the purpose of taxation would not be £1,200 less £400. </para>

                        GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia) [12.20]. - The Minister did not do himself justice when he said that the only alteration made by the bill was one to give effect to the suggestion made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                        when the first bill was under consideration that a man should not be allowed to charge twice for the work he had done. Another vital alteration has been made by the bill as the result of criticism raised by

                        the bill as originally introduced, paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">b</inline>
                        dealing with the value of improvements, provided that " the added value shall in no case exceed the amount that would reasonably be involved in effecting, at the time, as at which the value is required to be ascertained for this act, &amp;c." That has now been altered by paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                        of the clause now under consideration by the use of the words " improvements in relation to land means improvements thereon or appertaining thereto." They may be invisible improvements. In the previous bill no allowance was made for improvements appertaining thereto at the time the valuation was made, hut

                        misgivings about invisible improvements are met by the amendment made to paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline>
                        Another criticism raised by myself, I thirds, when the first bill was under consideration was that paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">b</inline>
                        did not make it clear that once timber was rung adequate provision was made for subsequent suckering. The bill was capable of being read as meaning that only the actual destruction of the timber could be classed as an improvement and not the recurring suckering. I cited the poison land in Western Australia, where shoots appear for several years after the first grubbing. Previously, the department said that, although the law did not actually express it, the practice had been to make allowance for recurring suckering and that i§ now expressly set out in paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                        of this bill. In all respects, therefore, the criticism raised in the Senate on the previous bill is met by the present measure.

                        COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [12.23].- The act itself contains no definition of " improvement " such as is now proposed to be provided. The words of the act are " assuming that the improvements thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner." That is a simple question of principle which a court can interpret, and it did so in the case which has formed the basis of the bill now before the committee. It is suggested that the definition of " improvements " we find in the bill  is  not exhaustive, although it goes into a great many things, perhaps into trifling things.

While the judgment of the court may have gone to the length suggested by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> in relation to duplication, it does not convey to my mind that it did so, and I can hardly see any necessity for the definition of improvements in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> I have no desire to repeat what I have already said on previous occasions in regard to this matter. I cannot see what is aimed at by defining "improvements." If the decision in the McGeoch case was as the Minister put it to us on the introduction of the previous measure, I could see necessity for this definition, but, on a re-perusal of that decision, J cannot find that the departmental gloss to which the Minister has given expression is borne out by the judgment of the court. </para>

                            <para>- If it is the intention of the Government to give legislative expression to a majority decision of the High Court, I do not think we need deal with the language used. The Minister has pointed out that the deductions allowable are not exclusive of everything else. They are really to point out to the department the way in which it should proceed. A portion of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> reads -  . . and also includes the destruction of other vegetable growths and of animal pests on the land to the extent to which such destruction retains its utility, but does not include the destruction by any person of any such growths or pests which establish themselves on the land during his ownership. </para>

                    <para class="block">I take it that those words are used in order to overcome the point which was raised in the McGeoch case. If a landowner is allowed a deduction for the complete destruction of certain growths, he cannot be allowed a further deduction for subsequent destructions. That paragraph continues - except to the extent, if at all, to which it restores wholly or partly so much of the utility of a previous improvement, in the nature of the destruction of such growths or pests as is, by the subsequent provisions of this definition, deemed to have been lost. . . </para>
                    <para class="block">I shall be glad if the Minister will explain later exactly what those words mean. What is meant by " subsequent provisions of this definition " ? These words do not appear to have any bearing on any other portion of the paragraph. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite agree with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that it would be preferable to give the owner of the land the benefit of all the improvements he has carried out. and which are not exhausted. If the Government intend to do that, the definition will have to be made clearer than it is at present, and with that object in view, I intend to move at a later stage to insert after the words " incidental to the destruction of timber " the words " or the clearing of the land." That would mean that we would give to the owner of the land, or his predecessor in title, credit for the improvements incidental to the destruction of timber, which would include the destruction of suckers and seedlings. A good deal of the land on which suckers grow is not timbered at all. </para>

                        <para>. - The definition of " improvements " does not appear to me to cover the damage done by flood waters. I have known instances along the Murrumbidgee and the Murray where flood waters have not only seriously destroyed the frontage country, but also caused red gum suckers to grow very rapidly. It was practically impossible for the owner of the land, through lack of funds, to destroy them in the early stages of their growth. Eventually the money was provided by a company, but the cost of clearing the land  of  suckers was then £10 per acre. </para>

                            <para>- Three or four years. They had to be cut out from below the bulb, although at one stage it was questionable whether it was worth while incurring the cost. ' The land was subsequently sold by auction at Wagga, and realized from £13 to £16 an acre. If land which eventually proved to be of that value should be abandoned because of insufficient consideration being shown to the land-owner, it would be very detrimental to the development of this country. The expenditure had, to use a colloquialism, to be met in one " wad " because the land-owner could not find the money to remove the suckers in the early stages of their growth. The firm which the land-owner approached in the first instance for financial assistance, refused to make the necessary advance, but he subsequently approached another company which provided the money, and as I have said, the land was cleared and sold at <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> good price. Is provision made for such costs to be deductable? </para>

                            <para>- The land to which I am referring is at Ganmain on the Murrumbidgee flats, and consists of an area of about 10,000 acres. After a big flood red gum suckers came up as thick as hair on a dog's back. A syndicate which then owned the land realized the danger and unsuccessfully approached its financial backers for assistance. I was then asked to inspect the land and I had to make up my mind whether the company which I was representing should advance the money to clear it because if that were not done it would become valueless. It was a harbour for rabbits and other vermin and the suckers were so thick that one could hardly walk through them. I decided that if the land could be cleared for £10 an acre, it could be subdivided and sold at a higher price. The company which I was representing then decided to let a ' contract at the price I had stated and the land was eventually sold by auction at from £13 to £16 an acre. I should like to know whether costs of that kind would be deductable. </para>

                        <para>. -  There appears to be some confusion as to the meaning of the word " deduction ". Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> mean the amount that could be deducted from the unimproved value of the land after a flood. In the case he quoted he said the land owing to the growth of suckers was practically worthless. Supposing that land worth £10 an acre. was reduced in value to £1 per acre as a result of a flood. For restoring land valued at £10 an acre £9 an acre might be spent in clearing it, and obviously the owner could not claim that the £10 should be deducted from land valued at £1 per acre. The department is anxious to get at the actual unimproved value of the land. There have been certain judicial decisions in this connexion. In the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> three judges of the High Court gave one basis of computation, but a fourth arrived at an entirely different decision.  Any change in the personnel of the High Court might result in a change of the basis of computation. The Government is asking Parliament only to lay down the principle whereby if litigation cannot be entirely avoided the chances of litigation arising should be reduced to a minimum. It is the duty of the committee so to legislate as to reduce the possibility of litigation. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 12.]fl to 2.15</inline> p.m. </para>

                        <para>A mau buys land infested with prickly pear, which bo clears at a reasonable cost of £2,000. The clearing will be ,allowed for as an improvement at the amount of £2,000, plus interest lost on his capital while the improvement is being completed. If, during his ownership, he allows, by neglect, the pear to partly reestablish itself and then later clears that new growth at a cost of £1,000 he will be allowed the £1,000, but the value of the original expense of £2,000 will be treated as having disappeared to the extent of the cost of the new work, and his total allowance for clearing prickly pear will be £2,000, plus interest. If an owner clears at a cost of £2,000 and allows reversion of growth to the equivalent of a cost of £1,000 and sells the land to another in that reverted condition, the purchaser will acquire a clearing value of only £1,000. If the purchaser then proceeds to clear the reverted country at a cost of £1,000 lui will be given credit for that expense. His total allowance for clearing prickly pear will be £2,000, made up of £1,000 personal expense and £1,000 acquired value from his predecessor in title. If an owner clears at a cost of £2,000 and allows reversion of growth to the equivalent of the cost of £3,000 and sells the land to another in that reverted condition, the purchaser will acquire no part of the original clearing value if he proceeds to clear the land of pear at a cost of £3,000; he will be allowed that amount plus interest as the value of the improvements.  "With reference' to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> B. Johnston, I submit that the definition, in its present form, meets the case of land on which the clearing is an actual improvement as opposed to mere maintenance. It includes the destruction of suckers and seedlings. Suckering is possible only where timber is on the land or was previously on the land. </para>

                            <para>- If it is not timber, then it is a vegetable growth. The department may arrive at a basis of computation which later comes before the High Court. That body sets out what it considers to be the true basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> gave a striking example of the confusion caused by that procedure. One judge laid down a certain basis of computation, but his three colleagues arrived at an altogether different conclusion. The dissenting judge is now the Chief Justice of the High Court. Unless Parliament desires that litigation shall continue, and the department's rulings liable to be challenged from time to time, it would be better for us to arrive at a basis of computation for ourselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> suggested that we should leave to the court the fixing of the basis. It would be better for Parliament to determine the basis, so that the risk of having to ask for a legal interpretation may be reduced to a minimum. Honorable senators must admit that the inclusion of this definition in the bill makes litigation much less likely than would otherwise be the case. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree that We have a clear judgment. The honorable senator himself admitted that the judgment of the High Court was given on a certain set of facts. The department has a number of cases in connexion with which it has not been able to make assessments. Are we to have a test case in every instance? The definition in the bill, while not seeking to alter the law as expressed in the judgment of the High Court, seeks to apply the same principle to other cases that might conceivably be determined on a different set of facts. The Government is trying to give to that principle a general application. Allowance is made for every factor that can bc foreseen, other than factors which come within the definition of maintenance as opposed to improvements. </para>

                        HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia) [2.29].  -  My suggestion is not exactly what the Leader of the Senate would have us suppose. I agree with him that it is impossible by any definition however comprehensive to cover every case that might arise. For that reason the Senate should lay down clear and definite principles, leaving the court to determine any case which might arise. Certain trouble is alleged to have arisen over this matter of prickly pear infestation. I do not think that there has been any trouble at all. The court decided the case on the principles laid down by Parliament and, to my mind, it decided it rightly, in the way that Parliament intended that such a case should be decided. If there is any direction in which we should amend the principal act, it is to strengthen the judgment of the court and to make it impossible for the minority view to prevail at any future time. In order that that may be done, I suggest that whatever we may do in setting up details, we should at all times be definite in our principles. I therefore move -

We are legislating, to put it colloquially, against the man who has not given attention to his country. But the case instanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> does not come within that category, and the owner of that land would be unfairly hit. If the words suggested by me were incorporated in the paragraph it would connote that the owner of the land had been negligent and had brought about that result. If the condition of the land is the result of an act of God, that would be taken into consideration in arriving at the true unimproved value of the land, and the man would receive an allowance for combating the pest. It has been suggested to me that my amendment should be placed a little earlier in the definition, so I propose to move - </para>

If the clearing of land is for the purpose of destroying suckers and seedlings, or vegetable matter, that is covered by the words already in the definition. To incorporate the words suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> it would be necessary' entirely to recast the paragraph, because of the possibility of the charge for maintenance creeping in. I suggest that the alterations advanced by Senators Colebatch and McLachlan amply cover the position. </para>

                        <para>. -  It appears to me that the position is becoming more complicated. Certain, principles are laid down for the taxation of land. A number of honorable  senators have had specific cases brought to their notice which they have ventilated in this chamber.I have no doubt that each of us, if he chose, could collect innumerable instances of a similar nature; but it would be impossible specifically to provide in the bill for all of them. In stead of removing the possibilities of litigation, we appear to be clouding the issue, and making it more difficult for the department to interpret the intention of Parliament. I am afraid that the resultant act will be a happy hunting ground for members of the legal fraternity when demands are levied for taxation, and claims for exemption are submitted to the department. It is a hazardous procedure to amend a definition such as this at a moment's notice. Shortly after the luncheon adjournment the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> clearly outlined the attitude of the Government and the department in regard to the interpretation of this measure. He pointed out that the principles of which Parliament approved when the principal act waa passed are those which are accepted to-day.The honorable senator gave a clear example of that. </para>

Personally, I consider that if the words were omitted, the sense of the proviso would not be affected, but I am informed that it is desirable that they should stand. The honorable senator, like myself, comes from a State where there is no division of the legal profession, and I understand that when a barrister settles the details of a bill for presentation to Parliament, he adopts this kind of legal phraseology. The inclusion of the words do not invest the provision with any legal complexity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> appeal's to regard them as a surplusage. That is not a sufficient reason for their omission. I should like to meet the honorable senator's wishes, but I am advised that it would not be desirable to do so. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The principal object of the bill is to overcome the result of the affirmation by the High Court in  McGeoch's  case of the interpretation of f~.li is phase of the law as laid down in Toohey's case, in  which  the court rejected the method of discovery of an unimproved value by deducting the value of improvements from 1 lie improved value because the words in the definition were "had not been made" and were to be read as if they were " had never  been  made." </para>
                        <para>The replacing of the words " did not exist" by the words "had not been made" would require it to be assumed, in ascertaining the unimproved value of land, that the relevant land was in a state of nature undisturbed by human agency and subject to such infestations of noxious growths and pests as would establish themselves thereon if unchecked. </para>
                        <para>This requirement would give a  signficance  to thu word "improvements" (in the definition of "unimproved value") which would possibly take it out of the definition of " improvements " - a definition which only applies unless a contrary intention appears. </para>
                        <para>Therefore the first result of the suggested substitution of words would be that improvements as contemplated by the substantive part nf the definition of " unimproved value " would not be comparable with improvements as contemplated in the proviso to the definition, because the word " improvements " in the proviso would bc governed by the definition of " improvements." </para>

                        <para>The explanation of that position lies in the fact that the elimination of the proviso disconnects the definition entirely from the definition of improved value, improvements, and value of improvements, leaving the unimproved value to be ascertained by reference to the condition of the land in a state of nature such as that al read/ described. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been troubled somewhat owing to the observations of the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> on this proviso as well as the proviso to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> and the explanation just given by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> seems to confirm a suspicion which I had that a new levy is being imposed upon taxpayers under the altered phraseology of these definitions. In the Nathan case, it was held that, for the purpose of ascertaining the 'taxable value, the land was valued as a registered racecourse and in circumstances suggesting that the registration of the property as a racecourse would not be refused in the future. Therefore, to ascertain its unimproved value it was only necessary to have regard to the value of improvements, estimated according to the sense given to the value of improvements by the definition in section. 3 of the act. In that case, the procedure followed was to deduct the value of the improvements without having regard to the value of the property as a quasi racecourse or, as in Toohey's case, a quasi hotel. </para>

I cannot help feeling, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had good reason for the doubts which he expressed during the second reading debate. If land for ordinary business purposes is worth £10 a foot, and if by reason of the fact that an hotel, theatre, or racecourse is established on it, it may have a value of £100 a foot, it seems to me that this added value is due to the enterprise of the man who established the hotel, racecourse or theatre on it. I cannot help thinking that the proviso of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> strikes at such cases. As I understand the Land Tax Assessment Act, it was never the intention of Parliament to impose this penalty on enterprise. It seems to me that the inclusion of these provisos will make the position of taxpayers somewhat worse than it -vas. </para>

What is to be gained by putting a phrase like that into an act of Parliament? I might just as well say that two and one when added together shall not exceed three. I do not think this novel provision is to be found in any other statute, and unless there is some hidden purpose for including it in the Land Tax Assessment Act it can have  no  meaning at all.

It seems to be clumsy. It seems to me also that the words " irrespective of the cost of the improvements " cannot possibly mean anything, and that the proviso needs  careful  consideration. All that we are allowing the taxpayer is the value of the improvements at the  time the valuation is made, and I cannot see why it should be necessary to say that it must not exceed "the amount that should reasonably be involved in effecting at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act improvements of a nature and efficiency equivalent to the existing improvements." Surely there is no need for this when it is already provided that all the taxpayer can get is the value of his improvements at the time of the valuation being made. What is the object of saying that it should not exceed what it costs to make equivalent improvements to-day ?

                        consider the position which might arise in connexion with the clearing of heavily-timbered land? I am not submitting an imaginary case, but stating what has actually happened. It cost a land-owner £40 an acre, say, to clear his laud, but after the lapse of a few years improved methods of clearing which were not available when the land was cleared, were introduced. With those improved methods it might have been possible to clear the land for £20 an acre. Does this provision mean that the man who had compulsorily spent £40 an acre in clearing his land is to be allowed only £20 because that would be the cost of effectively clearing the land when the valuation was made?

                            <para>- It does, because the department would value the land not at the moment it was about to be cleared. The question of a decrease % or an increase in the cost of clearing,  if  one takes into account the real basis, does .lot affect the matter. The honorable senator must realize that if the deduction were made on the higher cost, it would be made from the higher value, and if from the lower cost from the lower value. If the honorable senator is alluding to land which the owner allowed to remain in a virgin state from 1910, say, to 1930, and the cost of clearing increased during that period by 20s. an acre, the owner would be entitled to deduct from the improved value the actual cost in 1930. </para>

                        COLEBATCH (Western Australia) [3.21]. - That is the opposite to what I am suggesting. A man may own 10 awes of land, the unimproved value of which is very small, indeed. It may, perhaps, be £5 an acre; but it may cost him £40 an acre to clear it, thus making the improved value £45. After the lapse of a short period more improved methods of clearing heavily-timbered land might come into vogue, and reduce the cost of clearing to £30 an acre. The land which cost £40 to clear has the same value as the land which cost £30 an acre to clear. Would the man who spent £40 in clearing his land be allowed only £30 because that is all that would be required to effect improvements of a nature and efficiency equivalent to the existing improvements?

The words which he wishes inserted appear in some documents, but when we attach a proviso to a particular provision, such words as " except as hereinafter provided " are not used, as the proviso is part of the section. There is nothing in the preceding paragraph that necessitates the insertion of those words; there is nothing of a contradictory nature. I could understand the necessity of adding them as a qualification of something which the proviso might affect in some other section  other than  the section of which  it  actually  forms  a part.

A number of assessments are outstanding in. connexion with the point raised in the McGeoch case, and therefore if the law is to have any application at all it should be retrospective to enable the department to deal with those assessments. The bill sets out what has actually been the practice in the department over a period of years. Honorable senators will see the chaos that would result if the decision reached in the McGeoch case was to form the basis of future assessments. Other provisions are to get over that portion of the judgment which differed from our contention as to what was the proper intention of the act. </para>

The purpose of the clause is to enable the department to make assessments in regard to matters outstanding between taxpayers and the department. The Government does not desire to adopt the principle of retrospective legislation generally; but if this measure is to express the principle which Parliament believes should form the basis of departmental assessments, it is obvious that that principle should apply sufficiently far back to cover outstanding assessments. I give a clear and unequivocal undertaking that no assessments that have been made will be re-opened. This legislation in its retrospective application will apply only to matters not yet finalized between the department and the taxpayers. </para>

I should like to know, first, whether these statutory rules involve any alteration of the law in respect of the taxation of Crown leases in cases in which some taxation has already been paid under the law as it stood; secondly, whether they  involve any alteration of the law in respect of Crown leases on which a portion of the amount claimed is still outstanding and, thirdly, whether they involve any. alteration of the taxable value in Crown leases. I understand the taxable value in Crown leases to be its equivalent in freehold. Is something new now proposed, or do the rules merely set out the practice of the department in connexion with the collection of tax from Crown leases ? </para>

                    <para>Towards the end of 1928 the ship-owners, after consultation with the Australasian Merchants Association in London, announced certain increases in freight rates to Australia. The ship-owners made an agreement with the exporters from London that freights were to be increased, but at the request of the Commonwealth Government the increase in freight rates from Australia was suspended. Eventually an imperial shipping conference was held in Australia in April, 1929, to consider the whole question. The conference decided that, in order to avoid an increase in freight rates, it was essential to enter into an agreement as to freights and services. In the following June the Australian Oversea Transport Association was formed at a conference of accredited representatives of importers and exporters, and representatives of overseas ship-owners from each State. The association is a representative body consisting of graziers, wheat merchants, dairy producers and others - it is probably the most representative body of producers ever formed into an association. The object of the association was to avoid increases of freight and to ensure regular and efficient transport. This was the first time that separate producing organizations had come together to deal with the important question of transport. Representatives of the association urged an amendment of the Industries Preservation Act in order to remove all doubt as to the legality of contracts or agreements which might be made between shippers and ship-owners. The objects sought by the association were - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Government insisted upon freight rates going into the agreement. The amendment of the act which is now proposed will allow for an agreement between ship-owners and shippers. The draft standard copy has been handed to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce).</inline> The amendment will not give to the shipowners any greater powers than they have to-day. The period of contracts at existing freight rates has yet to be determined, but in no case will they be for less than one year, and they cannot be terminated, except by giving three months' notice. If notice is not given, the contract will continue for another year on the same conditions. The agreement will tend to stabilize freights, which can only be altered after a thorough investigation by the producers and the ship-owners. Notice would have to be given to the shippers if it were proposed to increase freights, and no alteration could be made without a consultation with the whole of the producers concerned. At the present time the ship-owners can increase their freights without consulting the shippers. Competition will not be shut out as between the various lines. Take a shipment of wool. If ten or twelve ships went, say, to Queensland when only six are required, there would be a great deal of wastage and the freight would necessarily be higher. If two boats went to Townsville and got a load of meat, it would be better than half a dozen going there and each getting a partial load. It would save a lot of wastage if one boat lifted the fruit from Tasmania, and one from the rest of Australia. The more wastage there is, the more expense and higher freight there naturally would be. An agreement would provide for regularity, efficiency, and speedy service. </para>
                    <para>Ship-owners have discussed this matter with representatives of different industries, and there has been a general desire to have an amendment of the Industries Preservation Act to enable an agreement to be made; Resolutions have been passed by the different organizations asking the Government to take this action. The  President  of the Australian Farmers Federal Organization said that the agreement would marshal the freight and organize the tonnage. At the present time shippers did not know what tonnage is available. It is absolutely essential for the primary producers to have the whole transport business thoroughly organized. The ship-owners have promised that if the tonnage is organized they will organize the freight. This will ensure cheaper rates and prompter service. At present there is no system and no organization. Twenty-two regular lines, which include British and foreign, will be included in the agreement, when it is made. Competition between these 22 shipping lines will continue, but the Shipping Board will allocate the portion to which each is entitled. The proposal will shut out competition from outside the 22 lines but if any other shipping companies desired to come under the agreement they could be admitted. Paragraph 4 of the proposed agreement reads :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The ship-owners further agree during the term of this agreement and in respect of the goods specified, not to enter into any arrangements with any shippers on more favourable terms than those of this agreement and that any shipper is entitled to enter into an agreement with the ship-owners in all respects similar to this agreement, and for the same cargo rates and conditions, irrespective of the quantity of cargo shipped by him. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>If there were, say, 1,000 tons to be shipped from Sydney, various ships, working under the agreement, would still be competing to get it. Unless the producers get the cheapest possible freight rate and the quickest service for their wheat, fruit, butter, &amp;c, it will seriously affect the development of the country. If the producers' organizations are not satisfied that they are getting a fair deal, the agreement can aways be terminated. </para>

He stated that the New Zealand Dairy Produce Board made a satisfactory agreement as a result of which, its products are transported at a considerably less freight than is paid in Australia. The Dairy Produce Board here is in a position to control the whole of its exports, but it is unable to arrange a contract with the ship-owners, owing to the existence of section 7a of the Industries Preservation Act. This agreement is not intended to cover wheat, flour, or cargo of that kind, which will be left to tramp steamers. The ships which carry the bulk of the wheat are chartered in London. </para>

                        <para>. I  am  wondering what effect the tariff wall recently built up around Australia will have on this agreement. It appears to me that ships will  now  have to come out to Australia empty, and that there is every prospect of shipping companies increasing their freights  on  our products sent to the markets of the world. I should be glad to  know  whether anything has been done to guard against such a contingency. </para>

                    <para class="block">Strange  experiences. This bill is one. It takes us back to the " bad old days " of the shipping ring which existed in London, when there was a rebate system that conferred conditions similar to those proposed in this bill. I was never against the withdrawal of the rebate system, although I am aware that it was suspect in the community outside of commercial circles. That system insured what this bill proposes to effect, continuity of employment of ships, and regularity of imports and exports which, after all, is  a  great deal more to the trader than rates of freights. I notice that rates of freights are to  be  stabilized by this measure, and that we are to have regularity and continuity of service. That is, above all things, of benefit to the importer and exporter. There is no suggestion of rebates under this system, and I am glad that that is so. In the old days there existed a monopoly - an autocracy - of shipping which was difficult to surmount. I was in London on one occasion arranging two charters of sailing vessels on behalf of my firm and the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited, one from Liverpool and one from London. I was immediately met with an objection from the ring, and told that the charters could not be made; that the ships could not be loaded. However, through the influence of our London agents, who were considerable shippers, the objection was removed and the two shipments effected. Fortunately, that sort of thing no longer obtains. Under this bill we shall enjoy the conditions of continuity and regularity which the old rebate system gave us. I see no objection to the bill, and I am prepared to support it. </para>

                    <para>. -  The bill segregates different classes of policies.

                <para class="block">The words in the brackets are inserted because they refer to a different class of policy altogther. There are dozens of classes of risks taken by insurance  companies,  and, as the bill develops, it will be found that they are dealt with in. a different way. It is not a life policy if the individual contracts with the company against accident. I suggest that when we reach a certain stage we retain the bill in the possession of the Senate in order that we may clarify any points that are at all in doubt. </para>

In this case the Prince of Denmark is the policy-holder. In ordinary insurance parlance, we always use the words " policyholder " and I thought, naturally, there would be a definition of " policy-holder " in this bill. Perhaps it would be better  to  use those words than " owner," Throughout the second reading it seemed to me the policy-holder was not very much in evidence and that the representations of the great insurance companies had been given careful consideration. </para>

                        <para>- My experience is that a policy-holder gets mighty little for his policy when he surrenders it. I cannot see how I can be described as the person entitled to receive the sums payable under the policy, although I may be entitled to borrow on it or sell it for its surrender value. The sum payable under the policy is the total sum for which I am insured, and if I make a will bequeathing my  interest  in the policy to some other person, the other person becomes the owner ; I do not. It seems to me that the interpretation fogs instead of clarifies the position. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> that the words " policy-holder " would probably  he  better than owner." Of course if my policy were an endowment policy, payable at a certain age, I could draw it; but [ cannot see how a person who takes out an all-life policy can be properly described as the owner of it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am afraid I have not made myself very clear ; but I give honorable senators an assurance that if there is any doubt concerning any of the clauses they can be passed, and, if necessary, reconsidered later on. In this particular case 1" cannot see any justification for the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> or the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch. This is a legal question, and we have to determine for the purposes of insurance that some person is the owner. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> should unhappily take that long journey to which he has referred, and had made a will, his policy would be handled by some person appointed to control his affairs. If, however, he died intestate, his legal representative would be the owner of his policy, the proceeds of which would be passed on to those entitled to participate. In those transactions the life insurance company would not take any part. This measure provides for dealing with the person who has a legal estate in, and who, for the purpose of life insurance, is the owner of "the policy. On the other hand, some person must be the owner of the policy held by a living person. If the owner of a policy should meet with an accident, any return from the policy would go to the holder of the policy. The honorable senator is confusing the position by making a distinction between a life insurance policy and any other property. A life insurance policy, subject to certain legal limitations and protections, is treated in the same way as any other property. That is all that is intended in this definition. </para>

It is easy to visualize a case in which a bonus is payable or the surrender value of a. policy is available,  and a wife, or child coming along and wishing to collect and perhaps some of the children saying that they did not wish to do so. It is a very bad definition, ana if adopted will establish a very bad principle. I ask the committee to closely study this definition in conjunction with the other clauses and to see if there is any justification for its inclusion. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not at all satisfied with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan's</inline> explanation. The honorable senator contends that a life insurance policy can be handled in the same way as other property, but he must remember that if a person mortgages a house or land, it may fall into the hands of his creditors. On the other hand, a person may take out a life insurance policy on which he pays the necessary premiums, but he may deliberately forfeit the policy. In such cases a life insurance policy 'differs from ordinary property. If a person who for the time being is the person entitled to receive sums payable under the policy is  the owner, then the person who takes out that policy is not the owner because he can never enjoy the benefits for which he pays. As those benefits will go to his heirs through the executor or administrator of his estate he cannot be regarded as the owner. Bonuses as a rule are not . paid in cash but are added to the value of the policy on maturity. The person who takes out a life policy is never the owner. Such a person deliberately takes out such a policy for the benefit of someone else. According to the definition the owner is the person to whom  the proceeds of the policy are payable. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that this definition was probably taken from some State act, but if that is so, it seems to me to be a rather unusual way of dealing with such an important subject. If that is the case, why does not the Minister take one of the State acts and submit it as a Federal measure? </para>

If the policy continues until the insured person dies, there is room for some doubt as to who is entitled to receive payment; but if during his life the insured person elects to accept payment, or should his policy be payable at a certain definite date, he, himself, is the person entitled to receive the sums payable. </para>

I point out, however, that a policy-holder cannot receive benefits twice over. If he insures against an accident or sickness,  and an  accident or sickness occurs, and the company makes payment accordingly, he has no further claim on the company. It is customary for insurance offices in such cases to strike out the appropriate portion of the policy. If the insured  person wishes to insure against a further accident or further sickness, he must make fresh arrangements. In the case of any irregularity the Registrar would be authorized to take any necessary action. His control will be limited only by an appeal to the court. </para>

                <para>It has been brought under the notice of the Attorney-General's Department that, on occasions, persons have registered companies in the name of well-known organizations operating in Australia. Naturally, those organizations took steps to protect their names in certain of the States. This bill is following the practice adopted in South Africa and elsewhere, of allowing every insurance company to register. Those companies then come under the discipline of the Registrar. But it is necessary to make some safeguarding provision such as that outlined by me, to protect the public. </para>

That  is a  right obtaining throughout the British Empire. My endeavour is to guard against those people who are so . astute as to seek to obtain benefit by using the name of an organization that has some measure of popularity. As the bill stands, the Registrar has no power to deny such a company registration. That is an opinion that I have received from the Attorney-General's Department,  in which  I respectfully concur. I am not seeking to invest the Registrar with disciplinary powers, but with powers of refusal. </para>

                    <para>. - I approve of the proposal, but it does not go far enough. What power is there to cancel the registration of  a  company that is not complying with  the  regulations ? Let me give an illustration. Certain enterprises are conducted by the governing authorities; for instance, the Commonwealth Bank. It would be highly improper if any other bank was allowed to assume a name which would lead people to believe that it was being conducted by the Commonwealth. Similarly, companies may seek to obtain advantage by describing themselves as co-operative concerns, when there is no principle of co-operation in their constitutions. I desire to see some specific prohibition of the use of certain terms or titles which may give the general public a fake idea as to the composition of the company. I desired to employ words to give effect to what the honorable senator requires, but was advised by the Attorney-General's Department that they might be misleading. Could not some specific precaution be embodied in the bill to prevent the use of misleading titles or terms ? I remember that during the war regulations were issued prohibiting the use of the term " Anzac " in connexion with any commercial undertaking. Could not something similar be done in this case? </para>

If a manager of a company has been punished for certain offences against the law and later becomes associated with another company, the registrar may refuse registration, and perhaps be involved in a libel action. Is it possible to include in the bill a provision to safeguard the Registrar from the legal consequences of his action in such a case as that?

                        <para>. -  The difficulty mentioned by the honorable senator is one which I think the insurance companies will have to face. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newlands</inline> will find, in later provisions of the bill, a number of safeguards which the . authorities consider adequate. These companies will have to furnish returns and must conduct their businesses with propriety. I do not think it would be competent, and if it were competent, I doubt that it would be proper, to vest in the Registrar the power suggested by the honorable senator. Any provision of that nature would be contrary to the principles of jurisprudence. The bill gives the Registrar considerable control over all companies, and directors of these concerns will have to see to it that undesirable persons are not placed in positions of responsibility. </para>

                    <para>. -  The question raised by the honorable senator was the subject of investigation by a British committee which reported absolutely against action to prevent foreign companies from carrying on business in Great Britain, because of the tremendous re-actions which would result. It would be a very bad gesture for us to prohibit foreign companies from doing business in Australia. Personally, I regret that a considerable sum of money is sent overseas in connexion with insurance, particularly in fire insurance premiums; but apparently the whole of our risks cannot be carried by Australian companies. On the other hand I should be loth to prevent any great companies from extending their businesses to Australia, for we need not only the strength which they would give us, hut also their capital. </para>

                        <para>- Yes they do. The honorable senator's amendment to prohibit foreign companies from becoming established in Australia, is in line with his political principles, but anything in the nature suggested by him would be a very serious matter. The position is amply safeguarded by the deposits, which some honorable senators would like to see increased substantially, and the maintenance of statutory funds. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly; and Australian companies have extended their operations to Great Britain and the sister dominions. The Australian Mutual Provident and the National Life Insurance companies have offices in London, and I believe the Colonial Mutual Insurance Company is operating in South Africa. If we took action to prevent outside insurance companies from operating in Australia we should, I am afraid, get short shrift in the sister dominions. I hope the amendment will be rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - Among the various conditions to be complied with before a scheme of amalgamation can be effected, I see nothing to provide that persons who are vitally interested - the policy-holders in the- -respective companies proposing to amalgamate - should have a voice in the transaction. The insurance companies are not supposed to be run solely for the purpose of benefiting shareholders. </para>

                        <para>- Although that may be the case there is no reason why they should not be afforded further protection. Too many gigantic swindles have been perpetrated on policy-holders in matters that, as the law stands to-day, cannot be brought within the law, but which if we had a sound law could be prevented. Life insurance at present is to a great extent a huge swindle. Policy-holders are robbed by the enormous overhead charges which are used as a cloak to provide fat billets for many people who are quite unnecessary. Policy-holders do not get more than a fraction of the benefits they should receive from the excessive premiums they pay. Honorable senators opposite have claimed that costs of production must be reduced in order to reduce the cost of living. Let them take some steps to see that these insurance companies which are now run in the interests of a few head  serangs  are so controlled that the interests of the policyholders are protected. It is impracticable for a policy-holder who is discontented with any scheme of amalgamation to agitate and bring about successful opposition to it. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline>
                    that this clause is far too important to be passed over without the Senate being satisfied that everything that should be done in the interests of the policy-holder is done. I have not had the time to study the matter carefully, but it seems to me that the clause does not go so far as the provisions of the English act in the direction of protecting the policy-holder. The English act provides that, unless the court otherwise directs, copies of a scheme of amalgamation, together with an actuarial report or other reports upon it, including a report by an independent actuary upon which the scheme is founded, shall be transmitted to each policy-holder of each company in a manner prescribed by section 136 of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act.

                    provides that before an application is made, any directions which may be given by the court upon application made with respect to any proposed scheme shall be complied with, but the requirement in this respect is exactly the opposite in Great Britain. Whereas under this paragraph the court has to go out of its way to direct certain things to be done, these things have to be done under the English act, unless the court can be satisfied that it is not necessary for them  to  be done.

                    <para>. - The transfer and amalgamation of companies in Australia have hitherto been governed by State legislation in Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. This legislation has been examined by the draftsman and other Government experts, and clauses 20 to 23, both inclusive, are the result of their combined efforts. Before any amalgamation can be brought about certain requirements, as provided in the articles of association of a company or by State Companies' Acts, have to be complied with. Honorable senators should regard this provision not from the opinions they may form from a perusal of two or three clauses, but from a general survey of the whole bill and particularly those clauses which have been framed for the protection of shareholders. The legislation in force in the States has, in some cases, been adopted. Honorable senators will agree that exception cannot be taken to any  amalgamations which have been brought about in Australia. Some years ago an American company amalgamated with a Victorian company, and there was no confusion or dissatisfaction. I think we would be placing too great a burden upon the companies if we asked them to acquaint every policy-holder of a proposed amalgamation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in a sense. Under this measure the judge who is to be the custodian of the rights of policy-holders has before him the actuarial position of the company which has accepted the responsibility. While I do not agree with the view suggested by some honorable senators that an amalgamating company remains liable, I wish to point out that the actuarial position of the company accepting the liability is the key to the whole situation. The judge who has to decide is in a better position to determine its actuarial position than any policy-holder, because he has before him, in tabloid form, a statement of the company's liabilities, from which he can. ascertain if it is in a sound position from a policy-holder's view-point. He has on the one hand the liabilities that are being taken over with respect to policies, and on the other the assets of the company. Is not the judge in abetter position to determine such a point than policy-holders? It is not obligatory upon companies to send notices to individual shareholders or policy-holders, but that is a responsibility of which they should be definitely relieved. The five requirements to be complied with are set out in clause 21, which reads - </para>

The judge is charged with the duty of looking after the interests of the policyholders. The assets of the average insurance company are more than ten times sufficient to meet its actuarial liabilities. Why should we impose unnecessary obligations upon insurance companies in the protection of policy-holders, seeing that, if there is any suspicion in the mind of the judge, the policy-holder will have an  opportunity to be heard. A policy-holder can be heard at -the expense of the company. Sub-clause 2, of clause 21, reads - </para>

                    <para>. - My objection to this clause is that it puts the cart before the horse. The court is asked to attend to a number of matters which should be settled first by policyholders. So far as I am aware, there is only one important insurance office in Australia that is a company; all the rest are co-operative societies, in which the policy-holders are really the shareholders. They should be consulted in the first instance. Some years ago, a fire insurance company with which I was connected had an opportunity to sell its shares to another company for 10s. each. Instead of notifying the shareholders, the directors purchased the shares at from ls. to 2s. each beforehand, so that the shareholders lost the difference. That might not occur here ; but I suggest that the policy-holders should be consulted before matters are taken to the Registrar or a judge. I should like to see the wording of the English act take the place of the present wording. </para>

                        <para>- If everything is so clear that he who runs may read, it should not be a big task for an actuary, and the expense should not be prohibitive. On the other hand, if the amount involved is large, and the transaction affects thousands of policy-holders, the expense of obtaining an actuary's report would be justifiable. I desire to protect the interests of the policy-holders. Ordinary persons are not so likely to see discrepancies and disadvantages in proposals placed before them as are men specially engaged to investigate them. If an official notice is not to be sent to policy-holders the least we can do is to protect them by having the scheme submitted to an actuary. A report from an independent actuary could be relied upon. Unless something of this nature is done tens of thousands of policy-holders will know nothing of these schemes until they have been finalized. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators have said that the policy-holders will be left without protection. That is not so, for this clause gives them a measure of protection almost unparalleled. Surely it should be sufficient to leave in the hands of the judge of a High Court the decision as to desirability of obtaining a report from an independent actuary. It is no light matter to undertake an actuarial investigation of a scheme of this nature. I have known of an actuarial valuation occupying eight or nine months. </para>

                    <para>These four Ministers, whose initials make the word STAB, formed themselves into a sub-committee of Cabinet and last January decided on an ordinance which gave to the big business mob every concession - except the right to indent Asiatic labour. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">The newspaper alleges that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> is in partnership with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Wren, and that by means of their agents or dummies they have taken up a certain gold-mining lease in New Guinea. It states further that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> was one of a sub-committee of the Cabinet which altered the mining ordinance in such a manner as to give the mining syndicate of which he is a member greater opportunities than the law, up to that date, allowed to practically ignore the obligations to employ white labour in the development of the lease. It alleges further that this alteration of the ordinance made it possible for the syndicate to hold a far greater area under lease than was permissible under the ordinances previously existing. If these allegations can be supported, they amount, in my opinion, to a charge of corrupt conspiracy to manipulate the laws of the Commonwealth for the purpose of private gain. What could be more libellous  and more ' damaging than a statement like that? There would be no defence at all. The onus would be on the newspaper concerned to prove the truth of its allegation. The court would compel it to prove the charge to the last line, or cast it in heavy damages. Surely such charges as these are not going to be passed by in silence. I suggest to the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> that if these allegations are not going to be investigated in the law courts, the Senate will readily agree to the appointment of a select committee to inquire into them. Such grave charges should not be permitted to remain unanswered. I should have thought that the Leader of .the Senate would welcome the opportunity to deny, firstly, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> was a partner with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Wren, and, secondly, that no such alteration had been made in the mining ordinances. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Am I to understand from the Minister's interjection that he admits that the allegations, so far as they refer to the alteration of the ordinance, are correct? I have not had an opportunity to read the ordinance, because ordinances are thrown on the table in sheaves and it is impossible to read the whole of them. The Senate practice with regard to ordinances emphasizes the need for the appointment of a committee of this chamber to watch more closely over the procedure. However, I do not wish to elaborate further the statement which I have made. I have said enough, I think, to impress upon the Minister the need, at the earliest opportunity, to probe to the bottom the charges made by the newspaper in question. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator repeated statements made in a certain newspaper, and as a member of a highly-placed profession he must be well aware that they will have wide circulation. He informed us that, if the statements contained in the newspaper referred to were not true, they were libellous. We are justified in asking what is behind these charges which the honorable senator has repeated to-night? He has made imputations against the honour of members of the Ministry, and would have us believe that he himself is a monument of political purity. I ask honorable senators to remember what the honorable senator said some time ago when certain proposals with regard to the development of Canberra were being discussed in the Senate. I hope the honorable senator will be good enough to remain in the chamber and, if necessary, give up the idea of returning to Melbourne by train to-night, so that we may fight this matter to a finish. On the occasion to which I refer the honorable senator made reference to certain leases in Canberra. It is generally known that he has considerable investments in buildings and land leases at Civic Centre. Possibly, also, he has investments in Melbourne.  His  grievance, when we were discussing these matters some months ago, was that unexpected developments had taken place at the Eastlake shopping area no doubt to the prejudice of his Civic Centre interests. Possibly the honorable senator is under the impression that, if the development of Canberra had proceeded according to plan, his investments here would have given handsome returns. </para>

If any one is prepared to repeat them on a public platform there are ways and means of having the issue decided in a court of law, so that the public may know whether there is any foundation or not for the innuendoes that have been cast upon the conduct of Ministers of the Crown. </para>

                    but when the Minister is replying I should like him to say whether the Government proposes, during the Easter adjournment, to take action under the Advisory Council Ordinance for the Territory for the Seat of Government. The ordinance itself was presented to the Senate at such a late hour to-day that it was impossible for me to take immediate action, but I have given notice of motion to disallow it, and it would be extremely improper, I submit, until that motion is disposed of when we next meet, to proceed with an election under the ordinance. Action may be taken, but I warn Ministers that it will not deter me from asking the Senate to support my motion, and that the Senate cannot be expected to be deterred from disallowing the ordinance if it is of the same opinion as myself. At the moment I do not know what its opinion is.

Are we to understand that trade union rates and conditions must be observed by all employers participating in such governmental benefit?

                    <para>. -  If the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will refer to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and the answer given by me he will see that what the Government said was simply that the law would be observed. The Senate will have every opportunity to discuss the Wheat Marketing Bill, and whatever the law may be when that measure leaves this chamber or leaves Parliament after a conference between the two Houses, it will be observed by the present Government. </para>

                <para>I am not in a position to give the right honorable gentleman an undertaking on behalf of the Government in respect of the Advisory Council Ordinance for the Seat of Government, but as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I shall certainly convey to Cabinet exactly what the right honorable senator has said in regard to his intentions, and it will be for Cabinet to decide what action shall be taken. </para>
                <para>I regret that the position I hold forces me to refer to the subject raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott. I regret for the sake of the Senate that it has been introduced. Unfortunately I cannot address my words to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott himself because, after getting all the publicity he sought, he has left the chamber without thought for the damage he has done to the people to whom he referred or the pain he has caused to honorable senators. If the matter was as important as the honorable senator made it out to be, the least he could have done was to be courteous enough to remain until the Leader of the Senate had an opportunity to reply. I hope when he reads <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will note my remarks and determine in future to sacrifice his own personal interests by remaining here, instead of hurrying away after making an attack on the personal reputation of others. Last night I referred to the minority of honorable senators of the Opposition. The majority of the Opposition, I am pleased to say, are " playing cricket.-" They are treating the issues that arise with the serious consideration that they merit, and I can have no cause for complaint at their attitude. My complaint is against one or two who seem to pay very little attention to their political duties, but are pleased to stir up mud and give rise to the unfortunate spectacle we have had to-night of an honorable senator being frequently called to order. In the present position of the Commonwealth our task is a big one. Instead of filling the columns of the press with matter? of no real moment to the nation, I hope honorable senators will concentrate upon the business of the Senate. To-night we had the sorry spectacle of the honorable senator who has provoked this discussion, admitting that he had not had time to read the ordinance about which he was talking, although he had had plenty pf time to read <inline font-style="italic">Smith's Weekly.</inline> I advise him to read the ordinances in future, because then he will be better able to decide whether newspaper statements even border on accuracy or not. I regret very much that the matter of the New Guinea Mining Ordinance has been raised here. I can say that it deals with an area not even within decent range of a mining lease held by a Minister of the Grown and cannot possibly affect the interests of any one connected with the administration in New Guinea. So far as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> is concerned, I may state that he is not financially interested in New Guinea, not even to the extent of a half-penny. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott, instead of coming into my room and meeting the Ministers concerned, and having it out with them, has preferred under the cloak of privilege to gain a little cheap notoriety in the press. If honorable senators are not prepared to realize their own responsibilities I ask them, at least to have a little sympathy for the responsibilities of others. </para>
                <para>As we are about to adjourn over the Easter vacation, I wish you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> on behalf of the Senate, a very pleasant holiday. </para>
