                <para>I do not think that I am overstating the position by using the word " urgent " in connexion with this motion. This subject, which has been under discussion for some time, and in which the wheat-growers are vitally concerned, is still an unsettled question in this country. Honorable senators will recall it was reported in the daily press that the price of wheat in London yesterday was 22s.11d. per quarter, which is a world's record in the matter of low prices. In considering the quantity available for consumption, which is an important factor in connexion with this subject, I find from inquiry from authentic sources that the world's supply of wheat this year is very much greater than it has been for many years. The Department of Markets and Transport has supplied me with the following figures which will give honorable senators some idea of the position in this regard. ' Taking 1920 as the starting point I find that for nine years - from that year to 1928 - the average carry-over of the world's production of wheat for each year was 316,000,000 bushels. In 1929 and 1930 the carryover was very much greater, the figures being 591,000,000 bushels and 540,000,000 bushels. The estimate for this year is 488,000,000 bushels. In yesterday's press it was reported that the Argentine Republic, which is always a strong competitor with Australia and produces as much wheat as we do has been struck by a natural visitation in the form of red rust. According to the report, this will be responsible for a loss of 2,000,000 tons, which represents from 70,000,000 to 80,000,000 bushels, and when deducted from the difference between the average for nine years and the estimate for this year, leaves the present estimate of 488,000,000 bushels over 100,000,000 bushels above the average for the previous nine years. </para>
                <para>The entry of Russia into the world's wheat market is something of a mystery. It is reported in this morning's newspaper that M. Stalin, head of the government of that country, which, in the past, has been the world's greatest exporter of wheat, says that Russia will once more gain world preeminence in the matter of wheat exports. He said, "All this talk of exporting wheat below cost, and of forced labour in Russia is sheer nonsense." <inline font-style="italic">I.</inline> have before quoted in this chamber the testimony of the crew of a Russian ship in Glasgow, and I shall repeat it in order to show that M. Stalin is telling the world something which has been directly contradicted by the crew of a steamer belonging to his own country. In a Glasgow newspaper of September 27th, the following paragraph appeared : - </para>

                <para>On the testimony of these Russian seamen it is quite clear that the Russian people are paying in their own country three times more for wheat than the price at which it is being sold to Great Britain to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the quality of the bread is not comparable. As I have said, the members of the crew of this vessel stated that the Russian authorities are dumping Russian wheat into Great Britain and selling it at one-third of the price at which it is being supplied at the Black Sea ports. If these statements are placed alongside those of M. Stalin, honorable senators will see that all this talk that Russian wheat is not being supplied under cost is so much nonsense. </para>

                <para>What is the position of the farmers engaged in wheat production in Australia? Happily, we are in for a  bountiful year, which is a relief. The estimated production is in the neighbourhood of 210,000,000 bushels, which is a record for this country; but when we compare the value of this year's crop with preceding years how disappointing it is. </para>
                <para class="block">In 1927, the value of our wheat production was £42,000,000; in 1928 it was £31,000,000; in 1929, £33,000,000, and this year on an estimated crop of 210,000,000 bushels at the present rate of 2s. a bushel, which is an outside figure, it will be as low as £20,000,000. It is useless comparing that figure with the records of past years when it was worth as much as £64,000,000 and £50,000,000. The important point is that, although this year we shall have a record crop as to quantity, the return from it will probably be £20,000,000 less than the return from last year's crop. It is well to have a record crop; but, after all, its value is more important than its quantity. A fair estimate of the cost of producing wheat is from 3s. 6d. to 4s. a bushel. With the price of wheat at 2s. a bushel, it is clear that, on every bushel produced, the wheat-growers of this country stand to lose ls. 6d. or 2s. How can they carry on in such circumstances? Already they are so heavily involved that it is difficult to foresee how they can obtain further assistance to carry them through. Unfortunately, the position is much the same in all the wheat-producing States. Hitherto, the wheat-growers of Australia have made a fair living; but they have now reached a time when, on account of the heavy burdens placed on them, coupled with the low prices for their product, they are faced with enormous losses. Unless something is done to assist them, many wheat-growers will be forced off the land as a matter of dire necessity. I believe that the Government is earnest in its desire to help the farmers; but, unfortunately, it has done nothing to fulfil its promises to them. At such times, deeds, not words, are wanted. The Acting Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> recently told a conference representative of the wheat industry that the Government had requested the management of the Commonwealth Bank to advance 2s. a bushel on this season's crop, only to be told that, even were the advance backed by the Commonwealth and State Governments, the Commonwealth Bank could not possibly accede to the request. Such, a statement naturally gives rise to a suspicion that we have been misled in the past. Only a few months ago, we were assured that the Commonwealth Bank was ready and willing to finance this season's wheat crop to the extent of 4s.  a  bushel; now, we are informed that that institution refuses to accept a responsibility of only 2s. a. bushel, even though the advance were backed by the credit of the Commonwealth and the States combined. These conflicting statements leave a nasty impression. We are forced to ask what importance can be attached to the statement that the Commonwealth Bank a few months ago was able and willing to finance up to 4s. a bushel for our wheat. </para>

                        <para>- This matter needs clearing up. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> recognizes the gravity of the situation, and the peril confronting the wheatgrowers of this country. I appreciate his recent action in permitting me to move a motion dealing with the wheat-growing industry before the Government business on the notice-paper had been disposed of. The Acting Minister for Markets and Transport, when addressing the recent conference, described the difficulties confronting the wheat industry as a " national problem." In another place recently, several supporters of the Government, including the honorable members for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jones),</inline> Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keane),</inline> and Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> stated that, in their opinions, the wheatgrowers of the Commonwealth had a " moral claim on the Government " for some substantial assistance by way of compensation for having complied with its request that they should grow more wheat. Nothing has been done. Why is effect not given to the promises of the Government, especially in view of the dire need which exists? In view of the danger which threatens so many wheatgrowers, and the probability of holdings being abandoned, the Government should strain every nerve to honour its promise to come to their assistance. </para>

                        <para>- Three resolutions were carried at the conference. First, the delegates agreed that the price of wheat for home consumption should be increased and the proceeds devoted to raising the general level of prices for the whole of the wheat marketed. Secondly, they advocated a straight-out guarantee of 3s. a bushel on railway sidings, and, thirdly, there was a suggestion by the honorable member for Wimmera in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> that 4s. 9d. a bushed should be paid for wheat at railway terminals. We have since been told that the Government cannot see its way clear to accept any of those proposals. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. A good deal was said about providing an amount for equalizing purposes. The Acting Minister made it clear to the conference that the Government was considering a proposal to raise the price of wheat to local consumers in order to provide a better price for the whole of the marketable product. His actual words as given on page 5 of the statement were : - </para>

                    <para>Ministers yesterday gave long and careful consideration to the proposal that a price should be arranged above export parity for wheat required for local consumption. Had the Wheat Marketing Bill submitted by the Com-  mon wealth Government to Parliament this year been carried there would have been little or no difficulty in giving effect to this suggestion. </para>

                <para class="block">On the one hand we are told that, "had the Wheat Marketing Bill been agreed to, no trouble would have been experienced in financing the crop, and, on the other, that a proposal for a much smaller guarantee has been rejected. What is the explanation? There is no use sheltering behind the rejection of the Wheat Marketing Bill. If the Government was in earnest it could get the necessary legislation put through now in a few days. The Government cannot go on fooling the wheat-growers. No longer can we feed them with an empty spoon. I do not charge the Labour party with being indifferent to the needs of the farmers of Australia - I believe that in its ranks there are many who entertain the kindest of feelings for them - but those members of the party who would assist the wheatgrowers are outvoted on every occasion by representatives of industrial districts who are afraid to raise the price of wheat or flour for fear that they themselves would be brought into disfavour. </para>

                        <para>remind honorable members of the Government and their supporters that, for the la,3t 30 years, the wheat-growers of Australia have had representatives of city interests, public men and all manner of appellants and suppliants knocking at their door seeking relief and protection, and never have their appeals been in vain. The people of the country have supported their city colleagues even to the tune of having to bend their backs to the resultant burden. Now, for the first time in the history of Australia, the wheat-growers seek a little reciprocation from the city interests and public men, and ask for but a morsel of the consideration that they have extended to them during those 30 years. Is it not fair that the city interests should turn a willing and attentive ear to those who have so obligingly and uncomplainingly borne the burden of tariffs and embargoes and other heavy imposts when they now say, "We have borne your burdens for the last 30 years and hope that, actuated by a spirit of fair play and gratitude, you will reciprocate and grant us a small measure of the assistance that we have extended to you in the past"? </para>

                        <para>- What, indeed? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> M.P., the Editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Western Australian Worker,</inline> was there, and by his unusual silence fully supported the sales tax expedient as a temporary relief to the farmers. The question is, what is to be done!? If some action is not taken the problem will resolve itself in a very simple way. A considerable percentage of these worthy sons of the soil will be forced into city areas. At a very reasonable estimate, there are 60,000 wheat-growers in Australia, and it is a fair thing to claim that every man engaged in that basic industry is responsible for the support of five other persons in the community. I have seen it proved repeatedly in isolated mining communities in Australia, that the activities of one miner meant the support of five other persons. If the necessary relief is not forthcoming 20 per cent, of those 60,000 wheat-growers will be forced into the cities of Australia. That means that the Government would have to keep 12,000 erstwhile wheat-growers and their families and children. At 10s. per week per person, that would amount to something like £1,500,000 which would have to be found annually by the Government in the form of relief. </para>

                        <para>- I am modest in my calculations. If the Government does not act promptly it will be faced with an unemployment problem compared with which the existing one will be mere child's play. The wheat industry is the foundation of our industrial and communal prosperity. The first inquiry that is levelled at a wheat-grower when he reaches town and the season is doubtful, is, "How is the season and the crops?" Town dwellers feel instinctively that they depend upon this product of mother earth. Now a combination of world events has brought about something worse than a bad season, and these worthy sons of industry are reduced to dire poverty. Can any government be so callous-hearted as not to hold out a helping hand to . them in their hour of need? </para>

                        <para>- Nothing. This is a government of negation so far as the wheat-growers are concerned. While it is prompt to extend sympathy and assistance to the city dwellers, it fails in its duty to those who have frequently proved themselves to be the hope, aye the salvation, of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> gave incontestible figures as to the value of the wheat industry to Australia. Unless the people knuckle down to it and take off their coats when carrying out the intermediary processes of manufacture and distribution, as the farmers have to do in the primary processes, the whole community, by a process of economic attrition, will be reduced to the necessity of doing their fair share of work in the general effort to recover our lost prosperity. Men in the baking trade demand a 44-hour week, while the farmers have to work 54 and 64 hours a week ! Employees in the city industries also have their basic wage, while the wheat-growers earn infinitely less than that sum. In the rich and prosperous State of New South Wales it was shown the other day that £6,000,000 was owing by the wheat-growers to their country creditors. The growers in Victoria and South Australia have been drought-stricken for three years. Just imagine the position that they must he in. A recent ministerial statement intimated that, even in the younger State of Western Australia, at least 8,000 of its 10,000 whea t-growers will shortly ' have to seek government aid. Some effective solution of the problem must be found. It is up to this Government to strain every nerve to extend the helping hand to these producers. I know that there are other speakers who wish to address themselves to the subject, and I shall not encroach upon their time. Time, if ever it was the essence of any contract, is the essence of this contract. We cannot follow the example of the ostrich and bury our heads in the sand in the hope that the matter will right itself. If the Government does not take prompt action it will result in dire consequences to the country. </para>

                        <para>- I support the proposal put forward by Professor Perkins: the imposition of a duty of 3s. per bushel on wheat used for home consumption as one alternative. If this is not acceptable, then something could be done to help the wheat-growers to put in next season's crop. That gentleman stated that his scheme would raise the price of a 4-lb. loaf by 1-Jd., hut I do not think that the increase would be as high as that. Further, there is ample room for improvement in the intermediate processes of manufacture. It requires more work and more economy in those processes. I appeal to those concerned to put their shoulders to the wheel and work as the farmers do, so effecting economies, which would make it unnecessary to increase prices to the consumer, so as to give the farmers a living wage. They now turn to the people of our  cities  in the hope that, for the first time, they will act as comrades. In the exclusive preserves of city employment, where by awards of arbitration courts and special tribunals, the citizens are assured pleasant times and easy conditions, it is an easy matter for employees to address one another as comrades in industry and social intercourse. If the same treatment is not now given to our rural workers, the movement from the country to our cities will be much accelerated. </para>

                    That is so. In New Zealand, with flour at £16 a ton, the price of the 4-lb. loaf is lid., whereas in Australia, with flour at £9 a ton, the 4-lb. loaf is ls. It is a disgrace that the baking industry - those engaged in the intermediary processes of manufacture - should be making such enormous profits.

                    GEORGE PEARCE  (West ern Australia) [3.43]. - Since
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    raised this very important question in the Senate a few days ago, I have read several statements in the press on the subject by Ministers, and I have to confess that I am puzzled to know what i3 the Government's view of it. At the conference, held in Canberra a few weeks ago, certain proposals were made to overcome the difficulty in which our wheat-growers find themselves to-day. One w'as that the Government should impose a sales tax on flour to enable a sum of money to be realized from the locally consumed wheat which, spread over the whole field of production, would increase the price of wheat by about 7d. a bushel. Honorable senators will recall that, when the Wheat Marketing Bill was under discussion in this chamber, I suggested an amendment, the effect of which would have been to increase the price of wheat by 6d. a bushel. The later proposal for a sales tax on flour would realize about the same amount, with this difference: The additional revenue would he obtained not from taxation but from the consumption of bread ; but since bread is a staple article of diet the two proposals are practically the same. In both cases the additional revenue would be derived from the people. On the face of it the proposal for a bounty on wheat seems to he a fairly simple one. No one questions that it would mean an increase in the price of bread.

                        <para>- Does it matter very much whether the individual makes his contribution to the revenue by means of taxation or by an increase in the cost of bread? Accordingly, I do not find myself in any difficulty with regard to the motion. I have definitely committed myself to the principle that some action is necessary to assist our wheat-farmers. When the Government's wheat marketing proposals were before the Senate, I was prepared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> support the payment of a bounty on wheat, but my amendment for a bounty was ruled out of order. We have on record a statement made by the Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> at the first conference in Canberra convened by him, to the effect that the scheme which he outlined as the Government's proposal included the appointment of State wheat boards., which, he said quite plainly, would have the power to fix the price of wheat for home consumption. The Government, we assume, believed in the scheme then and, a3 the Minister ' indicated, it contemplated the payment of the difference between the guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel and world's parity. As the difference was to be made up by an increase in the price of locally consumed wheat, obviously that would have meant an increase in the price of bread. It would be ridiculous to argue that if the proposed State wheat boards fixed the price of wheat at 7d. above world's parity it would not increase the price of bread, but that if the Government imposed a sales tax on locally consumed wheat it would mean an increase in the price of bread. And yet, apparently, that is the Government's view. It should be remembered also that, when the Minister submitted his proposals at the first conference, the general belief was that the price of wheat would be 3s. 6d. per bushel. To-day, it is in the vicinity of 2s. a bushel, so the position of the farmer is now infinitely worse. Prom this it is clear that if the Government's scheme had been adopted the State wheat boards would have been compelled to increase the price of locally consumed wheat, not by 7d. a bushel, but by three times that amount to make up the' difference between the guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel and world's parity which, to-day, is about 2s. a bushel. Nevertheless, the Government contemplated that as a possibility, not knowing, of .course, any more than any one else did, that a tremendous drop in the price of "wheat was then pending. One has only to read the speeches of the Minister at about that time to realize that he believed then that the price of locally consumed wheat would have to be increased by about 6d. a bushel above world's parity. The Government, I repeat. was prepared to back that scheme; but to-day it declines to endorse a proposal to impose a sales tax on flour, which would have precisely the same effect, with the difference that the liability would be limited to 7d. a bushel. </para>

It is the Government which has to answer before that tribunal, and it is no defence for the Leader of the Senate to ask me to explain my action. I am prepared to do that at the proper place - before my constituents, when the time comes. But the Government is responsible for administering the affairs of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity, when introducing the Wheat Marketing Bill, it professed that it was prepared to assist the farmers.

                        <para>- The most that was ever said by the Government in another place was that the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank had agreed to the financing of the wheat pool on terms satisfactory to the Government, and that the execution of a formal agreement would necessarily have to await the passage of the Wheat Marketing Bill. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin ) said : " The rejection of the Bill by the Senate prevents any further action for the present," and when he was asked if he would make the agreement available so that honorable members could really understand what it actually said, he replied, " See reply to question No. 1." That agreement has never been made available. I hope that a request I shall make to-morrow for its production will be more successful. Will Senator Daly tell us exactly what was the understanding between the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Bank? As I read the speech delivered by Mr. Parker Moloney, the Commonwealth Government said to the Commonwealth Bank, " We are going to guarantee the farmers 4s. a bushel for their wheat, andwe want you to find the money. We will guarantee to find you the money."</inline></para>

                    PEARCE.It meant that, at a time when it could not find £2,000,000, the Commonwealth Government would have been called upon to find for the Commonwealth Bank £20,000,000, representing the difference between the price of wheat to-day and the guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel at the siding. Evidently the Government said to the Commonwealth Bank,  "W  e shall  guarantee  4s. No matter what it costs, we shall guarantee to find you the money. Allwe want you to do is to advance from time to time as the wheat is delivered ". The Commonwealth Bank, probably said. "Very well". But

                    Clarke, the  President  of the Legislative Council of Victoria, has made the statement, which I have not yet seen repudiated, that all that the Commonwealth Bank really said was that it would find the money as the wheat was sold; that is to say, it would make an advance not of 4s. but up to the 4s. as the wheat was sold. If wheat realized 4s. from sales overseas, or partly from that source, and partly as the result of the fixing of an increased price for local consumption.  the Commonwealth Bank would simply be the vehicle through which the money was passed. The Commonwealth Government, as the tax-gatherer, would be supplying the money partly from the sales of wheat overseas and partly from the increased price for locally sold wheat. That would be quite different from the Commonwealth Bank being put forward as having committed itself to the finding of an unknown sum of money. The correspondence which passed between the bank and the Government is the only thing that can really tell us what it did undertake to do. I second the motion.

                    <para>. - The honorable senator who has brought this matter forward, would lead the people of Australia to believe that the present Commonwealth Government has no sympathy with the man on the land; but the Government has given ample demonstration of where its sympathies lie, and of what it is prepared to do to help the man on the land. Reference has already been made to the conference held in the earlier part of the year at the request of the Commonwealth Government. At that conference, representatives of all the wheat interests met at Canberra and devised a scheme for the orderly marketing of the wheat production of Australia by which the wheat-grower would secure a decent price for his product. At that time, the world's wheat crop was not supposed to be as large s.s it has turned out to be, and it was reasonable to suppose that the Australian farmer would get a fair price for his wheat; but the situation has altered tremendously, and it is now feared that he will get a miserably low price, instead of one that would enable him to make a decent living. Personally, I do not think the wheat-grower has any chance of making a decent living with wheat at 2s. a bushel. The Government has not ceased in its efforts to do something to help the farmers, but its hands have been tied, lit came into office with £5,000,000 deficit on its hands, and since then, the world-wide .depression has caused the position to go from bad to worse. Honorable senators opposite expect us to get rid of that load of deficit and work miracles they themselves could not perform although they had ample funds at their disposal with which they could have done anything they liked. Where does the blame rest? On the present Government or on the late administration which so mismanaged affairs as to bring the country into the fearful hole in which it now finds itself? In an effort to do something for the farmers, the Acting Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has conferred with th?' Ministers for Agriculture in the various  States to find out what really can b« done, and whatever suggestions they can put before him, and through him to the present Government, will receive the serious and sympathetic consideration of Ministers. The Acting Minister has also asked the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank what the bank is prepared to advance for the wheat crop. The bank's definite reply has been that it would not advance more than ls. 6d. a bushel. If honorable senators, who are criticizing the Government, would suggest some means by which the Government could do anything, Ministers would be very glad to hear them. It is easy to rise in the Senate and, in a tirade of talk, blame the Government. To offer suggestions for a way out of our present difficulties is not so easy. Every one knows the position of the Government. It has not a " bob " to spend on anything. Tens of thousands of men are walking the roads looking for work, and the Government cannot get sufficient money to give them an opportunity to earn something. Such is the position of the workers. The farmer will, at least, get his 2s.. a bushel for his wheat - if the price does not improve - and our first consideration should be to help the fellow who has nothing. If we had the means to do it, we should have.no objection to making opportunities available for employment to those who are now idle, and we should have no hesitation in giving a fair amount of assistance to the farmers, because we know how indispensable the wheat-growing community is to the progress of the country. It is, however, useless to waste the time of the Senate by talking about what the Government has, or has not, done. I notice that honorable senators opposite keep wide of the mark as to what they did when in office to bring about the present position. Even now Ministers are doing all they possibly can ; but  they have not received very great assistance from honorable senators opposite. How did we fare when we endeavoured to get the Wheat Marketing Bill through Parliament? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> says that the Labour party has great consideration for the industrial centres, but very little for rural districts. As a matter of fact, it was the representatives of the industrial centres, who, by their unanimous vote, put the Wheat Marketing Bill through another place. </para>

                        <para>- The Government was taking that responsibility. If it had had the assistance of honorable senators opposite in passing the measure, the organizations which were to be set up under it would have been operating to-day in the interests of the primary producer. That is the position in a nutshell. The responsibility rests with honorable senators opposite, and not with the Government, which was, and still is, anxious to do all it could to assist the wheat-growers. It is useless for honorable senators opposite to be so hypocritical as to endeavour to make it appear that they are the friends of the farmers, when their votes against the Wheat Marketing Bill are on record. They simply nailed that bill to the cross. I repeat, with a full understanding of the position, that, there is little ground for complaints made by honorable senators opposite against the Government. Personally, I cannot see any immediate way in which the wheatgrowers can be assisted. It appears that they will have to take their share of the unfortunate results that ' accompany depression, and to carry their share of the burden which is being borne to-day, especially by the underdog in this country. On any road in any part of Australia, one may see hundreds of men, and, unfortunately, many young men, searching for work, many of whom have not even a swag with which to cover themselves on cold nights. I do not know where they can obtain a crust, because many of the settlers alongside the road on which they are travelling are in as bad a position as they are. I do not know what remedy can be applied. The Government is at its wits' end to help the wheat-growers to overcome the difficulties confronting them to-day. It is practically helpless in this matter, and its helplessness was brought about, as everyone knows, by the action of the previous Administration, and by the unfortunate world-wide depression. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should have brought forward this wail, and I hope that the farmers of this country will not get it into their minds that the Government is unsympathetic towards them, because it proposes to go to any length it can to give them all the assistance and relief that is possible. </para>

The subject introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> should not involve recrimination; but, if recriminations are to be engaged in the present situation certainly calls for some remarks from me, which I did not intend to make regarding the attitude of the Government towards the primary producers, and particularly the wheatgrowers in this country. It is a parallel with their attitude in regard to the financial position of the Commonwealth. The Government has been dawdling, when it should have been most active. </para>

                        <para>- I merely wish to draw a parallel between the way in which the Government is handling the  finances of this country, and its conduct in the matter of assisting the wheatgrowers and primary producers generally. All that we can get from the Minister is a. promise that the wheat-growers will have sympathetic consideration. It is the same old cry that we have heard for some time. Not one of the concrete proposals submitted ata conference attended by representatives of the wheatgrowers has been accepted by the Government. The wheat season is upon us, and the position of the man on the land is most depressing. The primary producers, and the wheat-growers particularly, who are the backbone of this country, have never shared in the benefits obtained by those for whom the Assistant Minister has so much sympathy in the matter of the basic wage. The wheat-growers have worked long hours at very low rates of wages, and in doing so have materially assisted in maintaining the rest of the community. A concrete proposal was submitted involving the imposition of an excise on flour which would have increased the costa little to the people, as has been done in connexion with butter and other primary products. But' this is rejected. The Government has sought to drag a red herring across the track by referring to the rejection of the Wheat Marketing Bill in the Senate. Its rejection was undoubtedly in the interests of the primary producers. I do not intend, by any vote I record, to hand over the control of the products of the wheatgrowers to governmental management. If the Government could guarantee the wheat-growers 4s. a bushel for their wheat, as was proposed under the Wheat Marketing Bill, why has it not the courage to levy a tax on flour, which would be equivalent to only 7d. a bushel, in order to help them over the stile? It is between Scylla and Charybdis. It professes to be anxious to help the primary producers, but on the other hand it is afraid of those in the great industrial centres, whom it has to reckon with politically. Surely there was no justification for many of the remarks of the Assistant Minister in replying to the mover of the motion, whose speech, I venture to say, was marked, not only by the mover's cus-. tomary eloquence, but by moderation. Surely there was no occasion for the </para>

                        <para>- Of course. The Commonwealth Government was powerless to give the stipulated guarantee at that stage, and to-day it is not prepared to assist the farmers to one-fourth of the extent which it previously promised. It is incapable of making the rest of Australia contribute another 6d. a bushel to the price of the farmers' wheat. The whole position is ridiculous. The Government has called conference after conference - reached agreements, signed agreements, and some of its members have repudiated agreements that have been signed by executive heads. We are now informed that another conference is to be" held. What is the use of that? The farmers wish to know where they stand in this matter. It is merely dodging the issue, and it is time the Government declared itself, unless, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> put it, this great industry is going to fail. That it should fail is unthinkable; but if it does, it will be due to the inactivity of the Government. Everything points to the fact that the Government cannot make up its mind to grapple with this problem in any shape or form. Whatever course it intends to take, whether it be in accordance with the desire of honorable senators on this side of the chamber, or with the proposals which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> submitted, for heaven's sake, let the 60,000 wheatgrowers of this country know at once where they stand. Promptitude is everything in this case. The harvest is upon us, the wheat-growers do not know what provision to make for the ensuing year. I should not have spoken had' not the Minister introduced into the debate so much venom. It is not characteristic of him, and should not have been introduced, having regard to the importance of the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the Government is perfectly sympathetic towards the motion.

Three alternative proposals were submitted. One related to a sales tax on flour, another a guaranteed price of 3s. a bushel, and a third to the unpegging of the exchange. I can dispose of the second and third proposals very briefly. So far as the exchange is concerned, honorable senators recognize that the Government has no control over the position whatever. Whatever opinion the Government might hold as to the exchange being allowed to follow its natural course, in the interests qf the primary producer, it is powerless. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot speak for the Government ; but, personally, I should like exchange to be free in the interests of the primary producers. But whatever our personal opinions, neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> nor I can alter the exchange position. The same thing applies to the guarantee of 3s. Honorable senators opposite have said that Government members spoke with their tongues in their cheeks when they urged the claims of the Wheat Marketing Bill. That was not so. The Government made a definite promise to the farmers of this country, after having approached the management of the Commonwealth Bank, arid had that bill become law it would have carried out its promise, despite the consequences. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. A statement to that effect was made deliberately by the Prime Minister after a conference with the management of the Commonwealth Bank. The bank agreed to a certain guarantee on .condition that a pooling system was put into operation. Evidently, it had greater faith in that system than had honorable senators opposite when they were considering the bill.- The proposal of the later conference to which reference has been made was not that there should be a pool. </para>

                    on the subject of exchange. I do not think that the honorable gentleman can be correctly informed as to what has taken place in connexion with the fixing of the rate of exchange. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that the rate ofexchange was fixed some little time ago 'at£6 10s. per cent. That rate Was fixedasthe Result of aconference between representatives of the Commonwealth Bank, the private banking institutions and the Treasury. Subsequently, when it was found that too large a volume of the exchange was going past the bank's and that the arrangement entered into by the banks to provide £3,000,000 each month at Home, to meet London obligations, was in danger of being defeated in that way, the rate of exchange was again raised in the same way.

                        <para>- The Leader of the Senate said 'that the Government had no control over the exchange rate. Is he not aware that it is fixed in the manner I have just indicated ? I remind him that after the conference between the representatives of the financial institutions and the Treasury, letters were sent by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to all the large exporting houses which were likely to exercise the privilege of setting up their own exchange, not at the request of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank, but at the request of the Prime Minister, asking them to put their exchange through the batiks at the rates fixed. The concluding paragraph of that letter - of which, unfortunately, I have not a copy with me at the moment, although I have one in my possession - stated that, unless the exporters did what the letter asked, the Government would be compelled to take other steps. It is all very well to say that the Government does not fix exchange rates; but it has an overriding power. When the Treasurer, the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks in conference have fixed the rate of exchange it is still open to any private person to go outside that arrangement. The Government may not be responsible for fixing the rate of exchange; but it has told the exporters of primary products that if they go outside the rates fixed by the banks, it will exercise its prerogative of prohibiting them from exporting. </para>

The only other means at the disposal of the Government would be the prohibition of exports except under licence. No matter how the rate of exchange is actually arrived at, it is idle to say that the Government is not absolutely compelling the export of all primary products at the rate of exchange fixed by the representatives of the banking institutions in consultation with the Government-

                <para>With regard to the suggestion that the first of the requests of the conference might be carried out, I point out that the Acting Minister for Markets and Transport suggested that the imposition of an extra £7 4s. a ton on the flour locally consumed would involve an increase of 2d. in the price of a 4-lb. loaf of bread. Had the Government set out - as was the obvious intention of the Wheat Marketing Bill - to recover the loss between the 4s. advanced and the actual price realized for the wheat by increasing the price against the local consumer, it would have involved an increase of 7d. in the price of a 4-lb. loaf of bread. A few months ago, the Government was prepared to allow the price of a 4-lb. loaf of bread to be increase it by 7d. ; but it is not prepared now to increase it by 2d. An increase of £7 4s. a ton in the price of flour would not mean an increase of 2d. in the cost of a loaf of bread; it would mean only that there would be no reduction in the price of bread, resulting from the fall in the price of wheat. The Minister asks for suggestions as to the practicability of the first of the proposals of the. conference. I can only echo the sentiments expressed by the mover of this motion, that the consumers of bread, particularly those in the cities, in the interests of the primary producers should be prepared to forgo the advantage which a fall in the price of wheat would mean to them, thereby returning to the primary producers a very small moiety of what they have been compelled to give up in the interests of city dwellers who have received the protection of tariffs for many years. I cannot imagine any sane person in the metropolitan areas refusing to forgo a decrease in the price of bread in order that the wheat producers may be kept upon their legs, particularly in view of the ultimate effect of unemployment that would result from any decrease in our wheat-growing areas. It is obvious that, had the Wheat Marketing Bill been passed, only one or two methods could have been adopted to meet the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pointed out that whereas the guarantee now sought would involve the country in a loss of £10,000,000, the acceptance of the Wheat Marketing Bill would have involved it in a loss of  £20,000,000.  If we could have faced the greater loss, surely we can face the smaller. As a matter of fact, the Government exchequer could not have faced either loss. The loss, whatever it was, would have had to be recovered by an increase, in the price to the consumer. Whilst I entirely agree that the increase that would have been rendered necessary by a guarantee of 4s. would have been altogether impracticable, I cannot see that the increase which would be necessary to pay an increase of 7d. a bushel on wheat would be impossible. In any case, it would he merely a temporary expedient, and one which would have much to justify it at the present juncture. </para>
                <para>I do not want to question the bona fides of the Government, and I do hope that the closing remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council indicate that the Government is prepared to do something for the wheat-growers.' If it fails, what is the public to think? Previously, there was a proposal for a guarantee of 4s. a bushel for one year, the condition being compulsory pooling for three years. Some of the highest constitutional authorities in Australia set out, with good reason and vigorous argument, that the payment of that 4s. a bushel would be contrary to the Constitution of the Commonwealth. After that objection had been taken to the bill, and it had passed its second-reading in another place, an amendment was introduced providing that,  if  any portion of the hill was held to be unconstitutional, the remainder should stand with full force and effect. Unless the Government is prepared to do something substantial now, -the suspicion will undoubtedly lie in the public mind that the payment of 4s. a bushel would have been declared to be unconstitutional; that the Government would have achieved its object of obtaining the compulsory pooling of the wheat for the next three years, under government control, in pursuance of the Labour policy of the socialization of all the means  of  production,  distribution,  and exchange.  If  the Government likes to lay itself open to that charge, well and good'; but I do hope that, instead, we shall have some practical relief along the lines indicated by the </para>

All other problems should be set aside, for the time being, while we endeavour to evolve a method by which the wheat-growing industry may be kept going.

The matter is of vital concern to Australia, and such tactics were unnecessary. I shall not attempt to reply to the statements made by the honorable senator. I merely advise him and his associates to get to work and do something to relieve the position of our wheat-growers. What has happened in the past has nothing to do with the present problem. I am prepared to co-operate with the Government in an endeavour to evolve a solution, and I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> that the masses in the metropolitan areas should assist. That could be done without unduly increasing the burden of those in the cities, as the suggested assistance is so small that it would scarcely be felt when spread over the whole community. I believe that any measure that is evolved by the Government to relieve the wheatgrowers will have the approval of the community generally. There is no time for delay. The matter must be settled one way or the other, and promptly, and I urge the Government to get to work at once. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> brought this matter up this afternoon. There is not the slightest doubt that the condition of the wheat-growers of Australia is very critical. If they fail a very serious blow will be struck at the financial stability of Australia, which will do much to destroy the confidence reposed in the country. Our  60,000  wheat-growers work very long hours. They are probably the most efficient wheat-growers in the world, as they produce more wheat for a given rainfall .than do those of any other .country. Also, .their -grain brings 2s. .a quarter more than .that of .any other- nation. Yet, (because of a collapse in world prices, our growers are faced with ruin on the eve of harvesting the most bounteous crop that we have ever had in Australia. They do not work 34 or 44 hours a week ; more frequently they work 70 -hours a week. I am associated with sharefarmers who, for months at a stretch, work two shifts of twelve hours each, daily, operating throughout the hours of darkness with the aid of headlights from tractors. Our growers were exhorted by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin), Mr. Hogan,</inline> and others, to " Grow more wheat." The appeal was broadcast night after night until it became almost nauseating to those who were bending their backs to the task and already doing their utmost. What encouragement has the Government given them to grow more wheat ? An absurdly high tariff has been placed on all their requirements, with the result that they have to pay £610 for a tractor, £112 for a plough, and in like ratio for other tools of production. They have been loaded with high prices for their superphosphates and with high railway freights. Further, owing to our tariffs necessitating ships coming to Australia almost empty, they have had to pay high freights on the primary products that have been despatched to the markets of the -world. Our primary producers, and particularly the wheat-growers, have borne the burden. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I voted for the Wheat Marketing Bill when it was brought down by the Government. I thought that it would grant our growers 4s. a bushel for their product I believed that part of the guarantee would have to be met by the city dwellers, but considered that it was about time that they did something to assist our primary producers. Some of our manufacturers are spoon-fed with prohibitive tariffs. Some, like Lysaght's, are granted a monopoly. The wage-earners are protected by Arbitration Court and wages board awards, and enjoy the shortest hours and highest effective wages in the world. Coal-miners in Australia have refused average wages of £14 for a 34-hour week. A tremendous amount of assistance is given to cwn sugar industry - the consumers and taxpayers pay millions of pounds annually for that assistance - to our iron and steel and many other industries, but nothing is done for the wheat and wool growing industries, which carry the people of Australia on their backs. So I make no apology for having voted for the Wheat Marketing Bill. But I admit that when I did so I did not realize that the world price for wheat was to collapse to such an extraordinary extent, and that had the bill become law, the strain on the taxpayers of Australia would have been very heavy. I thought that the consumers of Australia might have had to bear a contribution of a few million pounds. I now realize that their contribution would have approached £20,000,000. If the Government was sincere with regard to the Wheat Marketing Bill, and was prepared to tax the consumers of Australia to the extent of £20,000,000, why is it now doing nothing to help the wheatgrowers ? It is no use calling conferences, and merely passing motions. The whole thing is so simple. If previously the Government could have financed our crop to the extent of 4s. a bushel, it surely can guarantee the growers 3s. a bushel now. The Government has a mania for taxing ; it has taxed practically everything, with the exception of fresh air. Surely it could put a sales tax on flour to increase the price of wheat by 6d. or 7d. a bushel? It is all rot to claim that, by increasing the price of wheat by 7d. a bushel, the price of bread to the consumer would be materially increased. When wheat was 7s. 6d. a bushel in Australia,  bread was  only  lid.  a 4-lb. loaf.  I  am now paying ls. for a 4-lb loaf in one centre and  lid.  in others. My share-farmers, who, in a week or so, will be delivering wheat at ls. lOd. a bushel at the railway, have to pay ls. for a 4-lb. loaf of bread. It is a crying shame. The people of New Zealand, who have been paying 6s. 2d. a bushel for their wheat, plus another 3d. a bushel for bags, making 6s. 5d. a bushel are charged only lid. for a 4-lb. loaf of bread. It is shameful that the price of bread should be so high in some parts of Australia. Bread could be sold at 6d. the 4-lb. loaf, or even cheaper but for absurd awards and extravagant  methods. Recently a contract was let in a northern district of Victoria at 53/4d. the 4-lb. loaf. At present prices for flour, bread should be sold at 5d. or 6d. a loaf. It is absurd to argue that, if the wheat-growers receive a bounty of 6d. or 7d. a bushel, there will be an increase in the price of bread. There would be absolutely no justification for any advance in bread prices. If millers can purchase wheat at 3s. a bushel, which is equivalent to 2s. 4d. or 2s. 6d. a bushel at countryrailway stations, and 6d. a bushel more than most growers are getting to-day, they should be able to sell flour at £8 to £9 a ton, and the price of bread should not be higher than 6d. a 4-lb. loaf. </para>
                <para>Too much attention should not be given to the argument that the imposition of a sales tax on flour would materially increase the price of bread. Where does the Government stand in this matter? If it is sincere in its desire to help our wheat-farmers, it should give evidence of its sincerity, because the position of our wheat-growers is extremely grave. I know of a number of sharefarmers who will have to walk off their properties, because, at the present prices, it will not pay them to take off their crops. Surely the Government will realize its obligation and do something, either by offering growers a guaranteed price or by the imposition of a sales tax on flour. Practically every other commodity is protected in some way, so it should not be impossible for the Ministry to assist our wheat-farmers. A sales tax on flour, to enable the payment of a bounty of 6d. or 7d. a bushel, would only ensure to the grower 2s. 6d. a bushel, which is at least1s. a bushel below the actual cost of production, notwithstanding that our farmers use modern machinery, and are as efficient in their methods as are wheat-growers in any other country. It is idle for Ministers and their supporters to shelter behind the excuse that the Senate, in its wisdom - I voted the other way - rejected the Wheat Marketing Bill. The defeat of that measure cannot be advanced as an excuse for the Government's present indifference to the serious position in which our wheat-farmers find themselves to-day. </para>

                        <para>- It is not right that Ministers should seek to excuse their apathy in this way. If they are sincere in their protestations for the welfare of our primary producers, now is the time to give evidence of it. The eyes of all our wheat-growers are on the Ministry. It is possible to help the growers in many ways; but the simplest and most feasible plan is to impose a sales tax on flour, thus making possible the payment of an additional 6d. a bushel to our wheatgrowers. This should not mean an increase in the price of bread, because for the last six months, at least, many bakers have been profiteering. This is proved by the price charged in open contracts. as I said before. One, in a northern district of Victoria, was 53/4d. for a 4-lb loaf. </para>

                <para>I again appeal to the Government, to do something before it is too late. Our wheat-farmers have been working against tremendous odds, and, at the present time, although the harvest is a bountiful one, the price is so low that it will not pay them to take it off. Within the last day or two, I have telegraphed to some share-farmers who, I know, are leaving their holdings, offering them work to take off my crops, although I know that, for every bushel which I garner, I shall lose at least 1s. 6d. I appeal to the Ministry not to delay in coming to the assistance of these magnificent men and women of the soil who have done so much to develop Australia and add to its prosperity. They are the people who have carried so much of the burden of taxation through high tariffs, Arbitration Court awards, high railway freights, high ocean freights, and other charges. If the Government does not help them now, Ministers and their supporters should for ever remain quiet as regards the rejection, by the Senate, of the Wheat Marketing Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not necessary that I should speak at great length to this motion because, prior to the last adjournment, the Senate fully discussed a motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> asking the Government to assist our wheat-farmers on lines recommended by . a conference which had been held in this building a day or two previously. It was amazing to me that on the day following the discussion of that motion in the Senate, the Acting Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> should have announced in the public press the rejection of the recommendations of the' conference; that the Government did not, in this time of financial stringency, intend to do anything to help our wheat-farmers. In view of the Government's decision, I should like to know why the conference was summoned. It was one of the most influential gatherings of its kind ever held in Australia. Representatives from all the wheat-growing States attended at the invitation of the Government to consider the wheat position and submit proposals to the Ministry. Some of the delegates travelled a distance of over 2,000 miles. They came from all parts of Australia, and were thoroughly representative of the wheat-growers' organizations in all States. Naturally, wheat farmers throughout the Commonwealth assumed that, since the Government convened the conference, it intended to do something of a practical nature to help the wheat industry. But what was the result? Within two or three days after the conference disbanded, and before some of the delegates had time to return to their homes, the Acting Minister for Markets intimated that nothing could be done. The real attitude of the Government was made apparent by the action of the Minister and some of his friends. The conference of Ministers for Agriculture in the wheat-growing States, although summoned prior to the day appointed for the meeting of the Loan Council was, for some reason, postponed until the day when the Loan Council met, with the result that the Premier and Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir James Mitchell)</inline> and the Minister for Agriculture in Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Walter Lee)</inline> were unable to attend except for short periods. Consequently, its proceedings were dominated by the Federal Minister and the Ministers representing New South Wales and Victoria. </para>

                <para>It was made obvious by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> that the conference of wheat-growers could not consider any proposal that was not in consonance with the resolution passed by the Ministers for Agriculture on the previous day. It was also made clear that any proposal to tax flour would have to be on a strictly limited basis. It was significant, too, that the Minister should indicate that he intended to souk the approval of the State Governments before levying what would be solely a federal tax. In spite of the opposition from Ministers representing Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, the wheat-growers' representatives carried three resolutions which had previously been announced. A sales tax of £7 4s. a ton on flour, to permit the payment of a bounty of 7d. a bushel for all marketable wheat produced in Australia, is a reasonable proposal. Although it3 adoption might not help the wheat-farmers to a great extent, it would be something. When the " Grow more wheat " campaign was in progress, farmers were led to believe that they would receive a much higher  price than is now ruling; and when the Wheat Marketing Bill was under d...cussion, they hoped to get 4s. a bushel. A bounty of 7d. a bushel, as suggested, is little enough, because, from one end of Australia to the other, the wheat-growers' organizations have been asking for n bounty of ls. a bushel this year, and for that bounty to be extended, as others are that have been paid by the Commonwealth, over a fixed period of years. The decision of the Government will be most disappointing to 60,000 wheat-farmers, of whom 8,000 in Western Australia are at the point of destitution. In spite of a very good season, they cannot pay their way this year, and special legislation has had to he put through the State Parliament to afford them protection from their creditors. The decision, however, will be more disappointing to the wheat farmers of New South Wales who, a few weeks ago, were misled by a statement broadcast from one end of the State to another as part of the policy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> the present Premier of New South Wales.

From an Australian point of view, I am sure that it was a very good thing the bill was defeated. I listened with considerable interest to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> this afternoon, and it appeared to me that they had only one thing to offer to the wheat-farmers of the Commonwealth, and that was sympathy, which, without assistance, is like mustard without beef - most unsatisfying to those who are looking for something substantial. </para>

                        <para>- There are people in the wheat belts who are literally starving, and they are offered nothing but sympathy. In spite of the resolution carried at that great influential conference held early this month, preceded as it was by a conference of Ministers of Agriculture of all the States, the Government turned round with remarkable celerity, and a couple of days later announced that nothing whatever would be done to assist the wheat- growers, either on the lines desired by the conference, or in any other way. The statements made by Ministers in this chamber are most depressing. Wheatgrowing is the most important  industry  of the Commonwealth. We are more dependent upon it to provide employment than upon any other industry; but ever since the inception of federation, through tariffs, and in every other direction, the farmers have had to carry the greater part of the country's taxation in order to support the cities and their secondary industries. This is the first occasion on which they have asked for assistance- &gt;-for bread - and they are given a stone, because to give the assistance they ask might mean a trifling increase in the price of bread to the consumers. The ministerial statement to-day shows clearly that no assistance whatever to the wheat-growers of the Commonwealth is intended by the Federal Labour Government this season. Either Ministers do not realize the plight of the wheat-farmer, or they have no plans whatever to relieve his difficulties. In this period of national emergency, as in other matters affecting the welfare of the .nation, the present Labour Government has absolutely failed. Ministers confess that they have no plans at all for the assistance of the wheat-growers. So far as they are concerned the wheatgrowers are deserted and abandoned by those who a few months ago were urging them to grow more wheat. </para>

The Acting Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> in announcing the rejection of the proposal that was put forward early this month at his conference with the representatives of the wheatgrowers; said-. </para>

                <para>The discussion at the conference showed that, a sales tax on  flur  sufficient to return the amount to the growers suggested in the South Australian scheme would increase the price of bread to the consumer by anything from id. to -id-, per lb.; that is, from Id. to 2d', per loaf. The Government is not prepared to support  this  additional impost on the people at the present time, with large - numbers out of: work. </para>
                <para class="block">It is a very moot point whether the proposed impost of £7 4s. a ton on flour would necessitate an increase in the price of bread. According to the figures I  hav9  worked out, no such increase would be necessary. The Acting Minister went on to explain that the present position had arisen entirely as a result of the rejection of the Wheat Marketing Bill by  the  Senate. The inference to be drawn is that the Government at the time of  the  introduction of that bill had some scheme for financing its wheat pool which is not now available, and that the scheme would not be open to the objection which the Minister says is fatal to the proposal to put a sales tax on flour. It does not require a very intensive study of  the  report of the conference between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney and the various wheat organizations held on the 18th and 19th February last to find that the very foundation upon which the Government's scheme -was built was a proposal to increase the home consumption price of wheat.

            <para class="block">These are merely quotations taken at random from the speeches delivered! at that conference. They indicate that,, by fixing an increased price for wheat for home consumption, the Government hoped to recoup itself for any loss that might have accrued as the result of giving; a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel. At that time the export price of wheat wasabout 3s. 7d.. or 3s. 8d. a bushel, so that the Government was actually proposing to guarantee about 3d. or 4d. a bushel above- the then market price. And, as it was proposing to shoulder only half of that responsibility, it is easily conceivable that the maximum price of ls-, a bushel!  above the world's parity, mentioned  by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tod,</inline> would have proved  quite sufficient  to pay all that the Government undertook to do. I have no desire  to  impute motives, or to say that the Government has twisted, or that it never intended to do anything in the matter. Nevertheless, when we compare the statements made by responsible Ministers of that time with those made to-day by others who are equally responsible, we find them difficult to reconcile, and the man in the street becomes rather sceptical about the whole concern. There is no need for me to repeat what other honorable senators have said about the position of the wheat-growers; but I should like to say something about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> remark that  a  sales tax of £7 4s. a ton on flour might bring about repercussions in connexion with our export trade in flour. There is certainly a possibility of that; but it would be nothing new. We have had quite a lot of that sort of thing in connexion with Australian exports for as long as I can remember. Every day countries are putting up tremendous tariff barriers against Australian products by way of reprisal for what Australia has already done in that direction. If the Government had granted the request  of  the conference to impose  a  sales:  tax on flour it would have been  putting flour in much the same position as some other commodities that are almost as essential to the life of the community. I remind honorable senators that at present the value of  a  bag  of  wheat is equivalent to the cost of only 10 to 12 lbs. of sugar. Yet this and preceding Governments have not found any fault with the fact that the Australian price  of  sugar is greatly in excess of world's parity. Although we export  a  tremendous quantity of surplus sugar, which is sold in the world's markets, we have never heard the Acting Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> offer any objection to this difference in price. If an increase in the price of flour for local consumption is  a  fatal objection to the proposal, surely such an objection is equally applicable to sugar or any other commodity which we produce and export. But it is only those who wish to support the wheat-growing industry who find themselves up against a stone-wall. We are absolutely at a dead end. If the Government had been honest in the first place and told us, as the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> did to-day, that it could not do anything, because of want of money, we should have had a certain amount of sympathy with it. If the Assistant Minister were honest he would say that, although the Government is unable to find the money to assist the wheat-growing industry, it will remove some of the burdens piled upon the primary producers by this and other Governments. For instance, a primage duty has been imposed upon cornsacks. An undertaking was given by the Assistant Minister, in another place, that primage duty upon imported butter boxes would be remitted when the boxes containing butter were exported. The Minister was asked to take similar action in connexion with cornsacks when exported with wheat, but he said that that was impracticable because of the difficulty in identifying the bags exported with those upon which primage duty had been collected. That is the substance of a letter which I received in answer to a request I made in that direction. Primage duty is collected upon cornsacks used by primary producers in their endeavour to make a living, and to increase production as they were urged to do by the Prime Minister for the express purpose of assisting to rectify our adverse trade balance; the imposts put upon them have nullified their efforts in every direction. If the Government has not any money to assist the wheat-growing industry, surely it can remit the imposts to which I have referred, and help the industry to that extent. Shortly before the last sittings of the Senate adjourned, I referred to the efficient manner in which I felt that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> had conducted the business of the Senate. What I said on that occasion was honest and sincere. In spite of what has happened I still believe he has more of the milk of human kindness than have some of his colleagues. I appeal to the Minister to use his efforts with his colleagues to see if something cannot be done to assist this very important section of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - A striking belief in the minds of some people in this country is that the wheat-growers have been spoon-fed too long. On the face of it that is manifestly untrue. In submitting the motion I should here mention the outstanding fact that whenever the railway systems of this country are showing a decline in revenue, and Ministers in charge of railways are asked their opinion of the prospects of the railway balance-sheet, they invariably reply that the railways' finances depend upon the wheat harvest. If there is a bumper harvest the railway revenue in the four principal wheat-producing States will recover; but if there is a poor harvest the balance-sheets will be unsatisfactory. Is not that clear proof that that main instrumentality of government depends upon this great industry as the chief means to balance their accounts? The industry is the back-bone of the balance sheet. From that it follows that those engaged in the industry are the main contributors to the success of our railway systems. Those who have had experience as a Minister in control of works and railways, as I have, know that to be a fact. Therefore, the foolish statement of those who say that persons engaged in rural pursuits have been coddled can be flatly contradicted by the outstanding fact that the railway systems in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia depend to a large extent upon the wheat-growers for their solvency when they are solvent. </para>

                        <para>- The Tasmanian Government depends upon the primary producers in the same way for a large portion of its revenue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> has at last found his tongue-string. I should like the honorable senator to visit the wheat-growing districts in New South Wales and attempt to justify the inactivity of the Government of which he is a supporter. If he did so, he could raise his voice to some purpose. It has been wisely said by some budding philosopher that there are only two classes in any community that cannot be organized - lunatics and farmers. The lunatics, because they do not possess normal reasoning powers, and the farmers, because they are too busily and honestly engaged in production to be associated with the tricks to which organizers of the present day are prone. They are hard down at their jobs every time and all the time. Clocks and watches  were not made for the farmers, but for those who have steady jobs in the cities, and who benefit by the production and constant exertion of the rural settlers. The city dwellers, who are always seeking a 44-hour- or shorter working week, and double pay for overtime, " smokos " and all the rest, are living in comparative luxury at the expense of the man in the country, who, with bent figure, struggles for an existence every day of his life. Now, when he needs a morsel of sympathy - merely a crumb that falls from the table of those rich gluttons - they will not give it. This drift to the cities will continue unless the policy- is reversed, and we shall reach the position depicted in Goldsmith's lines, " 111 fares the land to hastening ills a prey ". It is because of our present policy that many farmers' sons are to be found in our capital cities, and this in a land with vast areas to work and develop. Finding it impossible to make any progress in rural pursuits, they are attracted to the cities by the easy conditions enjoyed by those who have the audacity to call them " comrades." Comrades be hanged ! If any burden is to be borne it should be shared equally by the city and country workers alike. But what is the position to-day? Those in the city have practically no responsibilities, while the poor beggar in the country is bent and worn, and decrepit under the weight of his burden. Compared with fifteen or twenty years ago, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> value of our exportable surplus has decreased. In this country protection is afforded to one set of individuals; but what protection is given to the farmers? </para>

                        <para>- In order to secure votes, the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> told the farmers that if a Labour Government were returned they would get 6s. 6d. for their wheat. The unfortunate farmers are now the victims  of such promises, which were made from one end of the continent to the other by Labour candidates. Now is an opportunity for the Government to act. It is about time, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said, that this honest element in the community was fairly treated. That element comprises those who, because of the independence in their make-up, and their anxiety to carve out a livelihood for themselves, turned their backs on the cities. These men are infinitely more valuable members of society than are those who persist in hanging to the city areas, and who thrive on the efforts of those whom they refuse to assist. I have been recalling some of this Government's proposals. For instance, a sum of £100,000 was placed on the Estimates to repatriate certain coal-miners ; but I understand that that proposal has now been amended. The Government proposed thus to reward coalminers who refused to work at £2 a day; but it resolutely refuses to assist the wheat-producers, who work from sunrise to sunset. That is justice up-to-date. If the Government has changed its policy, it is because it is quailing before the city influences. Compare the action of a government which can provide £100,000 for such men with its attitude towards the wheat-growers, who are working from daylight until dark. There is no offer of £100,000 for these men. All it can do is to give them three cheers and ask for their votes later on at election time. Four months ago this Government was prepared to extend practical sympathy to the wheat-producers; but what has become of that sympathy? How has it been spirited away? Why has it oozed out? The only party worthy of support is that which can show some consistency. If the Government was sympathetically disposed towards the farmers four months ago, its sympathy should be even greater to-day, for the simple reason that the wheat-farmers need assistance even more than they then did. ls the wheat-grower to be left to his fate and to be a pariah in his own country ? I appeal to the Government even at this late hour to give further consideration to the alternative proposals submitted at the conference, and to do the fair thing by these men, who are the main element in our economic construction and at the base of our prosperity. If our very wheat farmers are compelled to leave the countryside, what will become of our prosperity? If those 60,000 wheat-growers, instead of being scattered throughout the Commonwealth, far removed from the spheres of influence, were concentrated in the suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne, honorable senators opposite would seek their support by doing something to assist them. The Labour party draws its support from the industrialists in the cities, and, therefore, does not  extend to the  farmers the sympathy- and help that it gives willingly to its supporters in the cities. I might paraphrase the old saying, that the nearer the throne the greater the favours that are bestowed, to read that the nearer the cities the greater the interest of honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibbons</inline> is an artful mau, who got into this Parliament by promising the farmers of Calare something which he knew there was not a dog's hope - not even a ghost's hope - of their ever being granted. The latter-day politicians of the Labour party will make promise after promise, knowing that they can depend on the gullibility of the electors and they exploit it for all they are worth. If the farmers of Australia, instead of tilling the soil, were trade unionists employed in the galvanized iron industry or the coal industry, or any manufacturing industry, the Government could not do enough for them. Only the other day, a few unionists employed in the galvanized iron industry received from the Government all that they wanted. I am a trade unionist of 40 years' standing; but I am not a trade unionist run mad. I have resisted those who have attempted to abuse the trade union movement. For many years I was the secretary of a trade union, receiving 30s. a month - not the £30 a month which impostors in the movement are getting to-day. I repeat that, were the farmers of Australia the producers of galvanized iron, they would get all that they sought from the Government; but because they are buyers of galvanized iron at greatly enhanced prices, they are pariahs in their own country. Like Belisarius, the saviour of his country in the days of ancient Rome, they are, as it were, searching for sustenance in the garbage bins. I can have no patience with the Government, which convenes conferences, expresses hollow sympathy, but turns down every proposal which comes from them. The recommendations of the recent conference have not been accepted by the Government, only because it fears that they would result in an increase in the price of bread, and that, in consequence, it would lose the votes of its supporters in the cities. But for that support, the Government would find its occupation gone. </para>

                <para>These are hard things that I am saying; but I feel that I must say them for I can conceive of no other reason for the Government's extraordinary attitude. Unfortunately, we have in office a flabby Government, which can do no more than make promises. The members of the Senate, representing every part of Australia, are prepared to give the farmers of this country a fair deal. Yet on the first occasion on which that most deserving section of the community has approached the Government for assistance, its request has been turned down. Of what value is the Government's boast that it will act justly by all sections of the community? What evidence is there of any desire on its part tq show that fair play, which is the pride and boast of every Australian ? The Government would drive the farmers off their holdings rather than deprive the profiteers of their profits, yet it has the audacity to seek the suffrages of the primary producers. Why should the farmers of Australia vote for the Labour party? The wheat-growers of Calare voted for a youngster - a gossoon who does not know a bee from a bull's foot - merely because he said that a Labour Government would guarantee them 6s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat. The electors of Australia are easily gulled. I am here to raise a voice on their behalf. I do not believe that all the members of the Government and its supporters are bad; but, unfortunately, the good in the party is over-ridden by the bad. </para>

                        <para>.- I listened attentively to the eloquent speeches by Senators Pearce, Colebatch and Payne on the Acting Treasurer's financial statement and although I shall find it difficult to follow them, I feel that, according to my ability, I should express my views as to what is necessary to extricate this countryfrom its serious financial position. In his budget speech delivered in July last, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said - </para>

This balanced equilibrium will be maintained on such a basis as is consistent with the repayment or conversion in Australia of existing internal debt maturing in the next few years. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">That is very definite ; it is a pledge by the Governments of Australia that they will balance their budgets, and meet their financial obligations, here and abroad, as they fall due. How different are the actions to the words. The Prime Minister, who is, no doubt, doing his best, has repeated in several of his speeches in the Old Country the determination of Australia to meet its liabilities and pay its interest and debts on the due dates. But what has this Government done since last July, when those determinations were arrived at? It has done nothing. It has even delayed the calling together of Parliament. It sat on the fence until the New South Wales elections were finalized. It wasted months, during which our finances drifted alarmingly. So much unnecessary delay has been occasioned that the financial position of the Commonwealth has drifted more than £6,000,000 to the bad since the July statement was presented, and the drift is continuing at the rate of over £50,000 a day. It is endangering the stability and the honour of our country. The good ship Australia seems to have been abandoned by those who should be in charge of it. Apparently, the pirates of the Labour party have taken control and have tied the hands of the captain and his lieutenants. They are perpetuating our financial drift, and the good ship is getting closer and closer to the rocks. She is in roughwater, making heavy weather. Through the neglect of the Government to call Parliament together, face the facts, and carry its promises into effect, the good ship is in peril. If the Governmentwill not take hold of the helm and put it hard about in an endeavour to steer the ship into safe waters, disaster isinevitable. </para><para>The following paragraph appears in the financial statement now being debated :  - </para><quote>
                    <para>The Treasurers feel, however, in view of the difficult outlook generally that it is proper and advisable for them to urge upon all governments the need for the utmost economy in regard to expenditures, and also that it is essential that the budgets of the Commonwealth and the States be balanced for the forthcoming financial year. This is necessary, not only because of the Australian position, but also because of the serious effect which the continued deficits in the accounts of the Commonwealth and States have undoubtedly had upon the credit of Australia abroad. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">We all know that the credit of Australia is at a very low ebb. Yet, instead of giving effect to its pledges, the Government has allowed the " Red " majority in its caucus to take possession of the situation. The majority, which is controlled by outside organizations, and, in turn, controls the Labour party, has carried resolutionswhich strike a staggering blow at Australia's good name, and at our credit. Our deficit is now enormous ; yet the Government allows the drift to continue. The Acting Treasurer is reported to have stated that the deficit at the end of the financial year might be from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000, but that, with the restoration of confidence and a revival of trade, it might be reduced from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000. The honorable gentleman is banking on two factors, which appear to be entirely beyond the reach of the Government. All will admit that there is nothing so essential for thewelfare of Australia as the restoration of its credit. It, therefore, behoves everybody to do his utmost to make the £28,000,000 conversion loan a success. The security is good, and the rate of interest is high. Everybody should subscribe as much as he can so that the pledge of the country to its bondholders may be fulfilled. If the conver-  sion loan  is not a success  it  will be a calamity, and will very materially weaken further the confidence  in  Australia, which already is at such a low ebb in the eyes  of  the world. To demonstrate that lack  of  confidence, which has come about since the advent of this Government, I draw attention to the values of government stock. In July, 1929, when the Bruce Page Government was in power, the price  of  Commonwealth stock in London was £98 5s. Since the accession to power  of  this Government, with its extravagant policy, its inability to stop the drift, and its domination by the " Red " majority, that stock fell as low as £75 5s., and is to-day quoted at about £85. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- In July, 1929, it was quoted at £98 5s. On the other hand, South African stock of the same denomination is quoted as just a little below par, while that of New Zealand is above par. Neither country is comparable with Australia  in  size, productivity, richness or recuperative power. That is  a  definite indication that our credit has slumped. Can any one wonder that that should be so after the staggering blows that the " Red " majority has dealt to our credit?

                        <para>- It is not bunkum. The caucus majority favours inflating our note issue, and if it insists upon its crazy idea there will be money to burn in Australia. All Australia now sees through the " Twenty-two " movement. The " twenty-two " would destroy the country's contract with the people who trustingly handed over their life's savings, the result of years of self-denial and thrift, to the care of the Government. Those savings represent the difference between the desire of the honorable citizen to be independent, and the professional cadger. But what about honouring the Melbourne agreement? What about the Government getting on with its job ? Why has it been dilly-dallying for so long, and why were Ministers so busy electioneering to help Lang and his gang? Lang made false promises. Among: other things, he promised farmers 7s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat. </para>

If they knew us as well as we know ourselves, they would have more confidence, and our stocks would not be from 10 per cent. to15 per cent. below the value of South African securities. </para>

The subscribers to the loans maturing on that date were definitely promised a certain rate of interest, and also that the loan would be repaid on the date named. In every essential feature, it was a contract between the Commonwealth Government and the citizens of the Commonwealth. Imagine then the feelings of subscribers to that loan when they heard the awful news contained in the Anstey-Beasley resolution. We know, of course, that this Senate and the people of Australia will never allow the Government to dishonour its promise, but our creditors in other countries do not know this. </para>

                            <para>- I was very glad when the Acting Prime Minister (Mr:. Fenton) during his stay in England took exception to the so-called news published in the British press concerning Australian affairs. Nearly everything one sees in the press abroad, particularly in England, having reference to Australia, is. derogatory and damaging to it. The news cablegrams' sent from Australia to the press abroad are disgraceful. They are calculated to create in the mind's of those who do not know this; country the idea that Australia is a barren, drought-stricken desolate country inhabited by a dishonorable lot of crooks. This has. gone on for years. Every day the English newspapers tell their readers about, a drought, a flood, a fire, or astrikein Australia, or that Australians are considering; the repudiation of debt's. There is never anything in praise of Australia. The Australian people are represented to be an inferior race. </para>

I am strongly in favour of having such a censorship. We have every right to be proud of our country and Great Britain has every reason to be proud of her lusty son. We have one of the most productive countries in the world. There is nothing Australia cannot or does not produce as well as any other continent. We excel in all our produce, they are all of high quality. Of our people 98  per cent, are of British stock. It is a higher percentage than England has. Everyone knows that the east end of London is crowded with foreigners; in fact, every one knows that England is the dumping: ground for foreign goods and foreign people; </para>

                            <para>- I am proud of Australia with all its faults and any temporary drawbacks there may be for the time being. We never see in the press abroad references to the magnificent war record of Australia. Australians excel at sport. Australia has produced great musicians, like Melba, the world's greatest aviators, and great scientists and great surgeons. The. personal surgeon to  His  Majesty the King is a Victorian. My blood boils when I hear the remark of visitors to the Old Country about what they read abroad concerning Australia. The result of it all is that the people of England are ignorant of Australia, its deeds and capabilities. Their ignorance in this respect is about equal to that of the Americans regarding Great Britain's effort in the world war. "We ourselves are largely to blame. Our press cablegrams to Great Britain are disgraceful. I do not know who sends them. Much of the Australian literature and most of the Australian moving pictures harp on bushrangers. Books dealing with the Kelly gang and the moving picture <inline font-style="italic">For the Term of his Natural Life</inline> make us out to be descended from English convicts, and that England treated her people with great cruelty. Untruthful rubbish of that type is all too frequent. The other day I was shocked to hear a member of this Parliament - not an honorable senator - say that he knew Armistice Day because it was on the eleventh day of the eleventh month that Australia's national hero, Ned Kelly, was murdered by the police. He knew Armistice Day and kept it up, not in remembrance of those who fell fighting for their King and country, humanity and liberty, but because on that day of the year, a stealer of sheep, horses and cattle, and a murderer had justly met his death. </para>

                    <para>It is shameful that our reputations as a people should be blackened by such wild talk as we have heard lately from members of this Parliament, and I trust that the Government will not be so mad as to adopt the suggestion to innate the currency by printing paper money. It would simply mean higher prices for all the goods we require for local consumption, higher costs on all our people in Australia, higher production costs on everything we export, and lower prices for it. Inflation, if indulged in, would inflict hardship on the wage-earner. The position has been put very plainly by James Murray in an excellent little book recently published, and. well received by economists everywhere. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Auditing the ki Note.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> says - </para>

The worst sufferers are creditors and wage-earners. The former are paid in money that buys less than that which they lent. The latter, though wages rise with prices, suffer from an inevitable lag between the two so that remuneration does not overtake the cost of living. </para>

Gold, coin, or bullion, is, by immemorial custom and by virtue of the metal's inherent qualities, a debt recognized as due by the civilized world to the holder; legal tender notes and metal tokens are, within the jurisdiction of the country in which they circulate, a debt due by the State, or the issuers, to the holders of the notes and tokens; bank balances are debts due by the bank to the customers. </para>
                    <para class="block">A great deal has been said by honorable senators opposite about banks locking up money, about freezing credits, and about the release of credits. The statistics of the associated banks of Australia show that close on 99 per cent, of their deposit money has been lent to the people. It is a larger proportion than ever previously in the history of Australian banking. It is well for those who say that the banks are to blame for the present state of trade to remember this. It is absurd for any one .to say that the banks are not lending out their money. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> also says - </para>

                        <para>It cannot be too often reiterated that government notes, before being issued, are printed pieces of paper only; they cost no more than the price of the paper and the printing. Otherwise they have no value at all. The greater the amount of notes in circulation in excess of requirements, the less the value of the notes, until the value of the note is negligible - a ?1,000,000 note is of less value than a packet of cigarettes. </para>

That is inflation. Apply this to the issue of notes; the result is the same. Notes issued against gold are worth 20s. in the ?1 of gold. Notes issued merely against the credit of the State are not worth 20s. in the £1 in gold, and an unlimited issue of notes against the mere credit of the State is worth nothing in gold. </para>

It i6 a popular fallacy that when the Federal Government issues a £1 note, it gives value with the note; yet it is an obvious, but amazing, truth that when the Federal Government issues a £1 note it does not give value. In every subsequent issue of notes by the Federal Government it is a physical impossibility for the State to give economic value; it cannot give, but on the contrary it must take, and it takes from the community. The only resource on the State is the power to tax, and that is not unlimited. It has already about reached! its limit. </para>

                        <para>It will be noted that recently overseas  snipowners  stipulated that freight prepaid in Australia shall be in British currency, not in the depreciated Australian currency. This is merely an instance of how a depreciated currency reacts on a community. The solution is to reduce the over-issue of notes in circulation and so bring down prices to synchronize  with the movement in overseas prices. This essentially necessitates the bringing down of the paper money wages, though not of the real wages, or wages expressed in goods and service. There is no other way. Australia is the only country within the Empire where the policy of the note issue is controlled by the State. If the State borrows from the community by forcing on it free of interest irredeemable £1 bonds or notes, the community pays. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is time the Government, and the people of Australia generally, faced economic facts which have been ignored, not only in our legislation, but by a majority of the people. We can no more ignore economic facts that we can stem the tide with a piece of string. The facts are simple. Our national income has been reduced from between £100,000,000 and £150,000,000. It is an old truism that one cannot take more out of a bag than has been placed in it. There are some who say that one cannot take more out of a bottle than has been placed in it; but that is hardly accurate, as in addition to the contents, I am told that a headache is sometimes obtained from a bottle. The reduction in our national income should be shared by all sections of the community. Those in a sheltered position in highly protected industries, members of  Parlia-  ment, and public servants, are obtaining profits or salaries equivalent to those which they received in previous years, while others are not receiving anything. A selfish section insists upon receiving the same wages and salaries, notwithstanding the depleted state of our revenue, with the result that a large proportion of the community have to be rationed or denied employment. It is a cruel uneconomic procedure. When men are rationed their wages are, in effect, reduced ; but the cost of production or of living is not correspondingly reduced. The so-called high standard of living in Australia does not exist. While the cost of production and wages have doubled since pre-war days, real wages, based on their purchasing power, have increased by only 1 per cent. The so-called high standard of living in Australia is enjoyed by only a few, while those who are rationed, or who are out of work, have no standard at all. </para>
                    <para>The latest statistics disclose that since this Government took office unemployment has increased from 12 per cent, to 20.5 per cent., and that in some States under Labour Governments such as South Australia, it is as high as 25 per cent. The position is probably worse than those figures indicate as they are based on the returns supplied by trade union organizations, with which a large proportion of casual and other workers, who are the first to suffer, are not associated. Probably 25 per cent, of our adult population is out of employment or soon will be. </para>
                    <para>This awful state of affairs is due to some extent to world-wide depression, and to a degree to our lop-sided legislation. Customs duties have been increased until the fiscal policy of this Government is almost one of prohibition. Moreover, there are striking anomalies in our tariff schedule. One of the latest acts of the Government in this respect is to place an embargo upon importations of galvanized iron, which is used extensively by primary producers and those who desire to build cottages for themselves. All hut those who live in expensive houses must use galvanized iron. The action of the Government in this respect has resulted in granting one firm a complete monopoly. </para>

                            <para>- Many seem to  overlook the fact that 98 per cent, of our total exports is produced by the man on the land. The costs of production have, however, become so high that it is now unremunerative to produce wool,wheat, manymetals, fruit, or any other primary  product. I was surprised toread in the financial statement -submitted by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that - after admitting the importance of our wheat crop and the wool clip, and stating  that the decrease in the value of these commodities was largely -responsible for the , general slackness of trade- wool was selling at 9d. a lb.;that last year it brought 16d. a lb., and the previous year it was 19d. a lb. It is an absurd statement. The facts are that at the time that statement was made about 500,000 bales of this year's wool clip had been disposed of at a gross price of 8d. a lb., which is equivalent to 7d. a lb. at country railway stations. Even that miserably low price was obtained only because the poorer grades of wool had not been placed on the market. Had the clipbeen disposed of as it came to hand, the net price obtained by the growers would have been only 6d. a lb., less than halfthe cost ofproduction. The Acting Treasurer, who was in error to the extent of 15 per cent, regarding this year's clip, said that last year's clip realized 16d. ; but the average price was only 10.4d., and the previous year's price16.ld,and not 19d., as -stated. Unfortunately, our trade in these commodities has been very much disturbed, : and it is to be regretted that Australian primary products are selling in the world's -markets ata price much below -.the cost of production. On previous  occasions I have stated that it costs 13d. alb. to produce wool in Australia, but Chief Judge Dethridge, who arranged for  an inquiry by 50 certified -accountants, who obtained expert evidence on the subject, stated . that the cost of producing wool was 14d. a lb. </para>

                            <para>- In the investigation conducted at the request of Chief Judge Dethridge into the cost of producing -wool, interest -on ,  the- value . of the property on which it was : produced was not  taken into consideration;but the interest on the money borrowed on the property was debited. The same procedure was followed with respect to wheat. If the property was free from any encumbrance, interest was not debited. Wheat which is costing 3s. 6d. a bushel to produce is now being sold at from1s. l0d. a bushel at country railway sidings. It 'is astounding to realize that the' valueof three bags of wheat is equivalent to that of only one pound of tobacco. Notwithstanding -this, no encouragement has been given to our wheat-producers, who have for years been penalized by high customs duties, excessive freights, and high wages. The value of a bag of wheat is equivalent to that of three pounds of tea, upon which this Government, -which prof esses to be , a friend of . theworkers, has imposed a tax of 4d. a lb. It has placed this . -additional tax on a necessary , and harmless beverage used in every household. One bag of wheat is equivalent in value to 14 lb. ofsugar. While the wheat-growing industry has for years been heavily penalized, the sugar industry, which has been costing the people of Australia millions of pounds annually, is spoonfed and highly protected. When it was suggested that a sales tax should be imposed on flour to assist the wheat-growing industry, the Government said that such a tax would result in increasing -theprice of a 4-lb. loaf of bread by1d. Nothing is said concerning the price which consumers are paying for sugar, galvanized iron, or the products of other highly protected industries. As the farmers who are receiving ls. lOd. a bushel for their wheat at country railway sidings have to give in the bag which costs them approximately 9d., they are receiving only ls. lOd. a bushel less the cost of the ' bag, say ls. Yd. a bushel. This Government, which a few months ago led the wheat-growers to believe that it would guarantee them 4s. a bushel for their wheat, is now declining to impose a sales tax- on flour, although by so doing it could increase the return to the farmer by 6d. a bushel, [t is afraid to run the risk of increasing the price of bread, as by so doing it would lose votes. It cares nothing for the primary producers except at election time. There is no justification for any increase in the price of bread. Almost everything that we produce in Australia is produced at a loss. I have already dealt with the position as it affects wheat and wool. Let us now turn to minerals. There is sufficient mineral wealth in Australia to' pay off our national debt if the cost of production were brought down. Look at the tragedy of Mount Morgan. Although minerals to the value of £16,000,000 were in sight the Mount Morgan mines closed down, throwing thousands of men out of work. The town- is rapidly becoming decadent because the miners have accepted the teaching that if the very high money wages are brought down the standard of living will be reduced. After all money is only a token. If we could win the wealth which exists in our mines and reduce the cost of producing the commodities which we have to sell in the world's markets every one would be better off. There would then be little or no1 unemployment. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>

                    <para>I thank honorable  senators  for granting me an extension of time. If only the miners of Australia could be brought to see that, if they accepted slightly reduced wages our mines would continue to produce wealth for Australia, how different things would be! What is the position in Broken Hill and other mining centres to-day? North Broken Hill has" ceased to produce zinc and is concentrating onsilver and lead. In 1913 lead was £18 6s.. 2d. a ton; zinc £22 14s. 3d. a ton and silver 2s-. 3£d. an ounce. To-day lead is £15 a ton or less;, zinc £14 to £15 a ton1,, and silver ls. 6d. an ounce. In 1913 when the prices of these products were much higher than they are to-day,, the basic wage for underground miners was 57s. a week of 48 hours as against the present rate of 95s. a week for a week of 35 hours. The result is that mines which ought to be still producing wealth have closed down. This calamity is recurring all over Australia. </para>
                    <para>During the last election campaign the people were promised that a Labour Government would open mines which had been closed and provide employment for all, but statistics show that during the present Government's term of office unemployment has increased from 12 per cent, to 20.5 per cent, of the population. In one State in which a Labour Government is in power 25 per cent, of the registered unionists are unemployed. In a country bursting with real wealth in the form df food, and cheap wool foiclothing, large numbers of people are on the verge of starvation. Clothing should be very cheap because the price of  wool  is very low ; bread should be very cheap because the price- of wheat is' very low, yet many thousands are illclad and ill-fed. Although all our primary products are cheap to-day, the cost of the finished article is so high that the prices of commodities to the consumer have not been reduced to any appreciable extent. "Last week I saw splendid fish sold at 3d. a lb., and Yorkshire Hero peas  for  4s. per 100 lb. Vegetables are cheap and the price of butter is relatively low. Producers are obtaining only 2d. per lb. for prime mutton. But the reduced cost of all these commodities has not affected the cost of living by more than a few per cent. At the present time Australia should be one of the cheapest countries in the world in which to live. Something is wrong when people are starving in. the midst of plenty. The problems of unemployment and poverty should; be tackled courageously without party bias.- </para>
                    <para>Some economists, in whose opinions I have considerable faith, attribute the prei sent world-wide depression to the locking up of the world's gold, which is the real medium of trade. During the past five years the value of the gold hold in Germany has increased from £59,000,000 to £112,000,000, and that of France from £164,000,000- to £362,000,000. The United States of America holds gold, to the value of between £800,000,000 and £900,000,000, while the value of the gold held in Great Britain amounts to £146,000,000. France and the United States of America together hold in their vaults 55 per cent, of the world's gold. </para>

                    <para>Australia is not receiving much assistance from the Mother Country because the Labour Government of England prefers to purchase wheat from Russia - a nation which has defaulted to the extent of £940,000,000. Australia, a country which has always paid its debts, is competing in the world's markets with a defaulting nation. The British Labour Government allows foreign nations to dump wheat into England to the detriment of Australian farmers. </para>

                    <para>It is, unfortunately, true that the prices now being obtained for our primary products are ruinously low; but I predict that there will be an improvement next year. Wool, which is now being sold at one-half the cost of production, is going into consumption because the low price has increased the demand, and as manufacture is keeping pace with sales there will be no carryover of wool, either in its raw or manufactured state. That condition obtains throughout the world, so that there is reason to believe that the wool outlook is more favorable than it was. If the world's wool users were to increase their consumption of wool by a1/4 lb. per head there would be a shortage of wool in twelve months. The present low price for wheat is largely due to the heavy carry-over from the huge Canadian crop of the year before last. This year it is reported that the Argentine wheat crop will be 75,000,000 bushels less than was anticipated, because of rust. The American corn crop shows a decrease of 600,000,000 bushels of corn used for feeding pigs. To make up that deficiency wheat is being used. There is no abnormal crop in the northern hemisphere; there . is a reduced crop in the Argentine ; and it is said that, although large quantities of wheat are being shipped from southern Russian ports, that country will soon have to import wheat to feed the starving hundreds of thousands in northern Russia. It may be asked why, in that case, Russia does not retain her wheat for her own starving people instead of exporting it from her southern districts. In conversation recently with a sea captain, he told me that it cost more to transport wheat overland from the south to the north of Russia than to import wheat through Archangel when the northern ports are opened after the ice melts. I feel confident that next, year our primary products will bring higher prices in the world's markets ; but unless we can reduce production costs we shall still have to sell at a loss. </para>

                    <para>What has become of the Government's promises? During the election campaign the people were told that a Labour government would not dismiss any of its employees, and that it would find work for all. Yet thousands of men, including many returned soldiers, have been dismissed from government departments during the last twelve months. In the Prime Minister's Department, 775 men, of whom 335 were returned soldiers, have been dismissed. I notice that 2,292 employees were dismissed from the Postmaster-General's Department; of whom 1,423 were returned soldiers. Nearly all of those employees have been in the service of 'the Government for approximately two years, and are good men. It is a sad state of affairs when the Government finds it necessary to dismiss returned soldiers in such numbers, men who rendered good service to the country during the war and who have proved efficient servants since their return. </para>

                            <para>- And that, too. While I am a believer in arbitration, I do think that in the interests of Australia, during such abnormal times as these, we should give . the system a holiday and urge the people to go into employment at lower money wages. That does not mean lower real wages. The costs of commodities and of living would come down with a rush, and £2 would then buy as much as £3 does now. It would bring down production costs of minerals and all other commodities that would create real wealth. Trade has been stifled by our ridiculous tariffs and embargoes. We are over-protected, and consequently, have lost millions through decreased customs revenue. The whole thing has become a farce; we are trading with nobody. Our tariff is ridiculous and full of anomalies. A monopoly has been granted to Lysaght's. Why should monopolies be granted to anybody? </para>

                            <para>- Our policy has alienated our best customers, with, the result, that Germany has imposed a duty of £9 a ton on our wheat, and subsidizes its own product, which is exported to our natura"! market, Great Britain. France lias placed a special duty on Australian wheat, and, like Germany, subsidizes  wheat exported to Britain. We have heard a lot about trade within the Empire, but neither this Government nor the British Labour Government has done anything to foster it. The British Government is trading with foreigners. While the Bruce-Page Government had a tariff that gave Great Britain a preference worth £8,000,000 a year, the present Labour Government has stifled our trade with the Mother Country by imposing a prohibitive tariff. What have we got from Great Britain in the way of preference ? </para>

This Government has done nothing to balance the budget except dismiss returned soldiers, and destroy our policy of defence. Its first budget inflicted an extra burden of direct taxation on the people to the extent of £12,500,000 per annum. This further budget discloses that the returns from customs revenue were overestimated. Of course they were. The tariff was too high. Even the cumbersome and irritating sales tax was a dissappointment.  Monopolies have been granted, which must result in a further loss of customs revenue. Then, to cap it all, along comes this cruel tax which penalizes producers and the thrifty citizens of the community - the workers. </para>

Instead of stopping at a minimum of £725 a year, I suggest that a minimum of £250 a year would he a fair figure to. start with for the purposes of Public Service taxation. The civil servants of Australia are a loyal and honorable section of the community, and I am confident that they are prepared to bear their fair share of the burden in times such as these. If they are not then they are not good Australians. </para>

                    <para>I have been instructed by the Central Executive of the Real Estate Association of Victoria to communicate with you, and to lodge a formal protest against the proposed additional property tax of71/2 per cent, now before the House for consideration. It is felt by the members of my association that while all sections of the community have to-day to bear their share of taxation, the proposed further property tax is most unfair in its incidence, and that it would press unduly upon a very large number of people. There are thousands of property-owners, both small and large, whose incomes to-day have been reduced in some cases almost to the point of extinction through the existing depression, which is responsible for a large number of houses becoming vacant. In addition to this, which is a direct source of loss of revenue and income, returns from their property have been materially affected for the following reasons :  - </para>

                    <para>For the above reasons,I am instructed to express the hope that when this matter comes before the House you will give it your most earnest consideration - not from 'the point of view of excluding property from taxation, but from the angle of whether the owners, who are suffering to-day to a previously unknown extent, should be so drastically harassed as will be the case under the proposed taxation. </para>
                    <para class="block">This new property tax practically amounts to confiscation. Then take the tax upon tea, the poor people's beverage. Why should those who are already rationed, and perhaps out of employment, bear such a tax? </para>
                    <para>We have heard a lot of abuse showered on the Bruce-Page Administration. The figures supplied to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> prove that the record of- that Government is an admirable one. During its regime, our national debt was reduced by £45,000,000, and £7,000,000 out of revenue was spent on defence. It also spent a great deal of money on reproductive works. The facts are that on the 30th of June, 1922, when the Bruce-Page Government took office, our war debt was £333,093,834, while on the 30th of June, 1929, it was £287,817,746, a reduction of £45,276,088. The works debt increased from £31,745,756 to £89,803,827, a difference of £58,058,071. That was an expenditure on reproductive works, such as the River Murray scheme, roads, post office, extensions of telegraphic and wireless com- munication  throughout the land, and so on. Despite all that expenditure on reproductive works, the total public debt of thi3 Commonwealth increased by only £12,731,983 during the term of office of the Bruce-Page Government. When it assumed office the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> debt was £66 4s. 3d., and when it relinquished office £59 lis. lOd,, or a reduction of £6 12s. 5d. That Government reduced taxation. This Government has heaped on the tariff with a shovel and knocked on taxation with a sledge hammer. , We also hear a lot about the Bruce Page Government having allowed what are by Labour senators and some others termed "Dagoes" into the country. Actually, the percentage of foreigners allowed into Australia during its regime was 19 per cent., while the figures under the present Government were 20 per cent, for the last quarter - actually greater than, those of the Bruce-Page Government. We are being crushed by tariffs, monopolies, and taxes, and living is altogether too dear. Where are the promised economies? There are none at all. We must face the facts. .There should be drastic and immediate economies. I have heard some suggestion, that the salaries of Ministers and private members should be cut by from 10 to 15 per cent. I should like to see the members of the Federal Parliament give a lead to the people of Australia and submit to a salary cut of 20 per cent, at once. </para>

                    <para>Take the extravagance  of the upkeep of Australia House, which is not a very efficient institution. I note that it costs £84,000 per annum for salaries. I hope that amount will be cut by half. The Government .has said, " You criticize us. Show us the way to economize." Did not the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> show how the Government could cut down expenditure by £4,000,000 ? But his suggestion, after ali, meant merely that expenditure should be brought down to the level of 1928-29, one of the boom years in Commonwealth expenditure. At present it is much above that point. The Bruce-Page Administration has been accused of being extravagant in administration, but, strange as it may seem, this Government is spending even more money, and to meet the difficult situation that has arisen, the Leader of the Opposition in another place offered a number of valuable suggestions to the end that the Government might balance the budget. </para>
                    <para>I hope that a more genuine effort will be made to  trade with our own people. Let us give preference, first to Australian goods and secondly to the Mother Country out of consideration for all that she has done for us, although I must confess that I am disappointed with the trend of the recent events in Great Britain under a Labour Government. Our trade position with the United States of America is wholly unsatisfactory. In the last ten years, we have imported from that country goods to the value of £332,000,000, and our exports, including gold, have totalled only £95,000,000. </para>

I believe that the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has saved the Labour movement in Australia. After three years of administration <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> and his Nationalist and Country party supporters left a deficit of £15,000,000. The Bruce-Page Government put up a similar record in Commonwealth administration. </para>

                    <para>This is a small measure designed to tighten up certain provisions of the Immigration Act in order to make effective the intention of Parliament. Section 5, which deals with the illegal entry of immigrants into the Commonwealth, was amended in 1924 to cast upon the person charged with being a prohibited immigrant, the onus of proving that he was rightfully in the Commonwealth. Honorable senators will realize that this is a very necessary precaution to take for the safety of the country, particularly in time of war. The utility of the amended provisions of section 5 was practically destroyed, by a recent decision of the High Court. The effect of this decision is that the amended provisions apply only in the case of a person who has entered the Commonwealth in contravention of the act after the passing of those amendments: Consequently these provisions cannot be used in the case of prohibited immigrants who gained entrance to the Commonwealth prior to 1924. In the case to which I have referred, Ah You <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Gleeson, the Court found that Ah You had obtained entrance to the Commonwealth about 1906, but as the Commonwealth was unable to prove that " he had evaded an officer " the case against him failed, and he cannot be deported. The law requires that persons entering the Commonwealth shall submit themselves to the recognized procedure and must be passed by officials of the Immigration Department. In the case of Ah You, it was apparently the intention of the Government to deport him, but because of the High Court, decision, this could not be done. </para>

                        The previous Government did amend the law with the idea of stopping loopholes that were discovered in it; but apparently, as soon as one loophole was stopped, another was found. I have perused the memorandum distributed by the Minister in charge of the bill, and I agree that it is desirable that the  law should be so amended.  I, therefore,  support the action of the Government.

It is interesting to recall that, as the outcome of an amicable arrangement between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia as high contracting parties, there was recently . an influx of two domestic servants per month to a State covering 500,000 square miles! </para>

                            <para>- The bill proposes to make the law retrospective to 1901. I doubt that the position of affairs warrants us in allowing the long arm  of  the law to reach back 30 years. The proportion of aliens improperly in Australia cannot be said to be large enough to dilute the race so badly and so warrant this proposal. If these people are here and are law abiding let them stay here. Before federation was established that principle was agreed to by every Colonial Parliament. In Queensland there was no question about the residential qualifications of any Chinaman, . or any other foreigner for that matter, who had entered the colony before the exclusion laws were brought into operation there. But now in this twentieth century we have arrived at the point where it is necessary for the poor wretch who landed in Australia 30 years ago, and has since given honest service to the country, lived up to every obligation, paid 20s. in the £1 and obeyed its laws, to explain why he did not enter the country in a proper way. </para>

                            <para>- Of course. I asked the Minister on that point, and he had no better reason to offer for this bill than that a man may have entered the country improperly. Could the Minister explain his conduct of 30 years ago? Could any honorable senator afford to have thrown on the screen his every action of 30 years ago? It is a matter of man to mau relationship. It should be regarded purely from a humane stand-point, and to ask the Senate so to amend the law regarding immigration that an unfortunate wretch who entered the country 30 years ago must explain how he got here, the company he kept, and name the ship that brought him is to ask too much of it. The fact that a man has no blemish on <inline font-weight="bold">Ms character</inline> should be ample proof that he has been a law-abiding citizen, and it should be ample reward for him to get the verdict in his favour. Why condemn him? Why put the brand of Cain upon him? Has the Government nothing better to do than to reach out after an unfortunate derelict who landed here 30 years ago? Surely it has mountainous difficulties to surmount. There are the requirements of 60,000 wheat-growers and 60,000 reasons why the Government should be doing some real honest serviceable work instead of paltry work of this kind. In any case, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions was allied to  a  foreign body that openly denounced our White Australia policy. But they cannot be attended to. What  a  dignified proceeding it is for the Government to be chasing a Chinaman, who landed in this country 30 years ago, while 60,000 good Australians cannot keep the bailiff away from their doors! But such is the equality of conditions in this country at the present time. Can the Ministry say that this Chinaman has broken the law - that he has robbed some one that he has in any way offended? Can it say that he has been anything but a law-abiding citizen ? If so, I shall vote for the bill. </para>

This bill, in short, is a gross outrage upon the liberty of the subject. It is not British justice, the standard under which I hope every honorable senator will enrol himself. But I had better not start on the brand of Australian justice or some of it abroad at the present time. All I am concerned with now is the fair name of Australia and its reputation, and particularly the fair name of the Government for which a soft spot exists in my heart. I want Ministers to do the right thing. I may speak severely of them at times, but I have a great respect for them personally, and socially, because I believe that if they behave themselves they are capable of only great good. When, however, they bring in a bill to chase a Chinaman who landed in Australia 30 years ago, and a law-abiding citizen, it is to my mind a mean, paltry achievement that can bring no credit on this country, the Government, or this honorable Senate. I feel that I shall have to vote againt the bill if forno other reason than that the Minister has given no rational grounds for asking the sanction of the Senate to it. I would deport those who are not law-abiding citizens, but the fact that men have been law-abiding for 30 years should be sufficient warrant for letting them remain in, Australia. </para></speech>

                        <para>. -  I regret the necessity for having to defend this particular proposal, but in case honorable senators may have been misled by the outburst of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I may explain that the bill proposes no alteration in the substantive law. It certainly does alter the matter of procedure, but it will not affect any person who obeyed the law prior to 1924. The Government has been castigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> for having brought in a bill which, in his opinion, amounts to an abrogation of the principles of British justice. I can assure him that for years he sat behind a government that administered the law in a manner which it then thought to be in accordance with the law, and as expressed in this amending bill. The High Court, however, said, "If that is what was the intention of Parliament, it had better use better language to express its intention." The present Government has not altered the procedure followed by the previous Government in dealing with this immigration matter, and no injustice has been meted out to any one; but there came a time when difficulty of proof arose and the High Court held that the procedure adopted by the previous Government was not the right one to adopt. The court said that if the intention of Parliament was that that particular procedure should be adopted, it should be expressed in clearer language in the act. I had no hand in the framing of the law in force in 1924, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> supported it. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth authorities took the action and the High Court held, in effect, that the particular section of the Immigration Act did not truly express the intention of Parliament. But every day the High Court justices differ from parliamentarians as to the language which should be used in the construction of a law. The Commonwealth took action against this particular Chinaman following a procedure which had been in operation for years, and to which previously no one had taken exception. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure, but that does not affect the principle. We are not dealing with that particular point. In effect, the High Court has advised Parliament that if its intention was that the procedure followed by the Government for years was to be adopted, the language of the act would need to he altered. Accordingly, the Government has altered the language only to call forth the language used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> No alteration in the substantive law has been proposed. The bill simply alters the words governing the procedure, and actually does not alter that, procedure which had been followed without causing any comment until this particular case came before the High Court. There is no possible chance of any injustice being meted out to any one. The bill, in unmistakable language, simply shifts the onus of proof on to the immigrant, and renders it possible for the department to administer the act as our predecessors had it in mind to do in framing their legislation. </para>

                        <para>. -  There are two angles to this matter. As regards one, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has relieved my mind by saying that this legislation will have no application to Ah You, who took his case from the humblest tribunal in Western Australia right up to the High Court and succeeded in convincing that august tribunal that his contentions were right. Pursuant to the policy always adopted by governments., I take it that the legislation the Senate is now asked to pass will not be applied to Ah You unless there is some very definite reason within the ministerial knowledge to depart from that principle. We can, therefore, ' eliminate from this discussion all reference to the personal equation or to any possibility of injustice towards this individual. The proceedings in this particular case in which honorable senators appear to have taken some interest, are summarized in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus Law Reports</inline> in this way - </para>

                        <para>Under the "Immigration Act 1901-1925," the defendant was charged that lie being an immigrant who, on 21st March, 1930, failed to pass the required dictation test, was a prohibited immigrant and had evaded an officer. The information was laid under section 5 (1) of the act, which enacts that any immigrant who evades an officer may, if found at any time thereafter within the Commonwealth, be required to pass the dictation test, and if he fails he shall bo deemed a prohibited immigrant. It was established that the defendant was in Australia in 1906; and there was some evidence that he had entered the Commonwealth in 1895. There was no evidence that lie had evaded an officer, but the information relied upon section 5 (3) of the act as rendering the  aderments  in the information prima facie proof of that fact. </para>
                        <para>Held that, though the relevant provisions &lt;&gt;f 5. (i) of the Immigrant Act 1901-25 are identical with the relevant provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901-1908 (the enactment in force at the time of the alleged evasion of an office) ), yet, as the provisions of section 5 (3.) of the Immigration Act 1901-25 were not enacted until after the alleged evasion they were inapplicable to the case and there being no proof of any evasion the prosecution failed. </para>

While I agree that this is a hard case, subject to the Minister's assurance that- it will not apply to this person, I shall support the bill. Action is not taken without reason; but it seems that as this person escaped the vigilance of the law for  24  or  25  years, he might be allowed to remain here.

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                        on this subject. If the case quoted by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline>
                        is the only reason, for bringing forward this amending measure, it is entirely inadequate. This provision is intended to deal only with law abiding people; it has no specific reference to offences against the law. Without the amendment now proposed any immigrant who entered the Commonwealth since the  1924  act was passed, is undoubtedly subject to that act, so that the only persons to whom this amending measure can apply are those who entered the Commonwealth prior to 1924. I think it is generally held that only the strongest possible reasons justify the provision in an act of Parliament of an obligation upon n defendant to prove his innocence.

It is quite wrong to make the law retrospective so that persons who came to Australia 25 or 30 years ago can be traced, and be liable to deportation unless they prove that they did not " evade an officer." Some of those men may have contracted family ties and entered into business relationships in Australia, and it is intolerable that they should now be liable to deportation. If the clause were made retrospective a few years, I should be inclined to support  it; but  I shall not support  it  in its present form.
