          <para>.- When progress was reported on Friday last I understood that the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had accepted a suggestion made by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> that paragraphl should he omitted from his amendment because of the provision existing in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-section1. After careful study of the amendment, I think it is necessary that the Leader of the Opposition should adhere to his original intention. Paragraphl enacts that the registration of an organization may be cancelled if in the opinion of the court, it has not altered its rules as required by sub-section  4  of section  55,  and it appears to me that the explanation given by the Leader of the Senate does not hold good. I hope the Leader of the Opposition will stand by his original amendment. </para>

          <para>. -  I again appeal to honorable senators to accept the provisions in the bill, so as to bring about a better feeling between employers and employees. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">i, j,k,</inline> andl were inserted in the act at the time when Parliament considered such action was necessary in the interests of arbitration as opposed to conciliation, which, in the view of this Government, is the better policy. If these provisions are retained, they will continue to be a source of irritation. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> give the court authority to cancel the registration of an organization if that course should be considered necessary. The discretionary power contained in those paragraphs is sufficiently wide to meet all circumstances that are likely to arise, so the retention of the paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> tol is not necessary. Their deletion will be consistent with the idea which the Government has in view, namely, that the parties should consider their industrial troubles outside the strict legal atmosphere so often associated with arbitration court proceedings. The Government is relying upon the doctrine of conmon sense. I hope, therefore, that honorable senators opposite will not use their strength simply to maintain in the act provisions which no one can suggest gives the registrar more power than is conferred upon him in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the section referred to. </para>

When this provision was last under consideration I referred to Judge Beeby&#39;s finding in the Waterside Workers case, in which he quoted numerous instances where that federation had imposed domestic rules, varying in each port, but contrary to the award. If an organization is to frame&#39; and enforce domestic rules contrary to an award under which it is operating, it is not entitled to the benefits of conciliation and arbitration.

        <para class="block">When this provision was last under consideration I was at first impressed with the arguments adduced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> but since then I have had time to give the matter further consideration.

If an organization does not comply with sub-clause 4 of clause 55, which is being retained, what will be the position ?

        <para>SenatorDALY (South AustraliaVicePresident of the Executive Council) &#91;11.20&#93;. - If an organization after complying with certain prescribed conditions is registered, and it is subsequently discovered that one of the conditions precedent to registration has not been observed. the registrar may, under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> cancel the registration of the organization on the grounds that it has been registered erroneously. Obviously, if an organization has not complied with the conditions of registration the organization has been registered erroneously. Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that the powers conferred upon the Registrar under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> are not sufficiently wide to enable the cancellation of registration? Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> relates to an organization or branch of an organization which has made or given any domestic rule or order contrary to the terms of an order or award of the court. If paragraph is read in conjunction with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which provides that the court may cancel the registration of an organization if it thinks that for &#34; any reason &#34; the registration of the organization ought to be cancelled, it will be seen that the former is unnecessary. The powers of the Registrar are not in any way limited, because there is in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> an expressed direction of the legislature.

            <para>- And they may be wrong. It seems a pity that these paragraphs cannot be considered by honorable senators opposite apart from the viewpoint that, because they have been enacted, they should be retained. They really do not mean anything, beyond being a condemnation of the trade union movement. In view of the discretionary powers given to the Registrar in the specific circumstances I have mentioned, they are quite unnecessary. They do not give the Registrar any greater powers, and are a bad advertisement for the trade union movement, and one which it does not deserve. </para>

            <para>- These organizations can be made corporate bodies with power to hold property, but the legislature has not been blind to that fact, as there is a safeguarding provision regarding the property of an organization. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k,</inline> certain powers are conferred upon the Registrar, but the legislature decided that more specific powers should be provided as set out in paragraph We have an illustration of the necessity for this provision at the present juncture. An award has been made in a certain industry, and a substantial number of the members of the organization concerned are disregarding the direction of the controlling body by defying an award of the court. Surely the proper method to deal with such an organization is to deprive it of the benefits of arbitration by de-registration. If the executive of the organization is unable to discipline its members, or a substantial number of its members are breaking the award, the organization should be de-registered. I cannot see why any exception can reasonably be taken to these paragraphs. The Minister could have strengthened his argument if he had quoted paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> which, if slightly amended, could be made more effective.

As paragraph c is to be retained I cannot see why paragraphk andl should not also be retained. Paragraph seems to meet the hiatus which might occur in such a case as I have cited. The only organizations which have anything to fear from such  a  provision are those which are refractory and transgress the code of the arbitration law. Organizations which seek the benefits of arbitration legislation should be prepared to abide by the awards of the court.

        <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) &#91;11.32&#93;.  -  An unanswerable case has been made out for the rejection of the amendment. Seeing that in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> there is power for the Registrar to cancel the registration of an organization for any purpose, no wider power is possible.I can understand that some honorable senators opposite are determined to retain in our legislation the obnoxious provisions which were placed there when the enemies of Labour were in power. When dealing with arbitration matters the late Government tried in every way to place insulting and repressive legislation on the statute-book. It did so in the most offensive manner possible. I have nothing but contempt for honorable senators who, at the beginning of this new Parliament, stated, as did the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that they recognized that the electors had given the Labour party amandate to amend the arbitration laws according to Labour ideals, and now demand that&#39; the miserable repressive legislation of the Mussolini type should be retained. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> said that only refractory organizations need fear the retention of these provisions. I tell him that before long we shall deal with some of the reactionary and refractory politicians, and shall wipe out the whole of the obnoxious provisions which enable a limited governing class to impose its rotten ideas of legislation on a people allegedly free. We, on this side, are not greatly concerned about the particular provisions which honorable senators opposite seek to retain. I tell them to use their numbers as they will, for they will soon bite the dust for having opposed the will of the people. They will soon find that they will have to occupy a different position in the future. </para>

I defy any one who understands, the rudiments of the English language to find a more embracive term than &#34; for any reasons.&#34; The only object of the Opposition in proposing to retain these provisions is to irritate and goad trade unionists into action which will lead to the de-registration of their organizations. If I were an active member of a trade union I should not care what honorable senators opposite proposed to do under these specific provisions. Why should any citizen, in his private capacity, not be free to advise his fellows whether or not a certain class of employment is desirable or otherwise? Why should a man be penalized for telling a fellow worker that it is inadvisable for him to seek employment in a particular capacity ? </para>

            <para>- Yes; because I know that it is impossible to give effect to the legislation providing penalties for lockouts. An employer may reduce his staff, or close a section of his works - in fact do anything he likes except openly admit that he has locked out his employees - and go scot free. He is penalized only if he deliberately states that he is locking out his employees. I shall not attempt to deprive any employer of the liberty of doing what he can de in any case. The proposal to retain these paragraphs is actuated by a desire on the part of those who climbed to political eminence on the ladder of Labour and are now the most vehement opponents of anything that will benefit the workers, to injure those with whom they were at one time associated. </para>

          <para>.- The speech of the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat is a splendid example of the conciliatory attitude of the Labour party!  His  speech was in striking contrast to the temperate remarks of his leader. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would cause in this Senate the same trouble that he has caused outside. </para>

            <para>- This country has on its statute-book certain laws, one of which provides that men may go to the Arbitration Court and obtain an award governing their employment. Lately, an award was given in connexion with the shearing industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> according to the press, went out of his way to preside at a meeting in Sydney to encourage the men to defy that award. The meeting appointed a committee of the rank and file of the organization to appeal to the executive of the Australian Workers Union to defy the court&#39;s award. Notwithstanding that there is legislation for the settlement of disputes by the court, the honorable senator urged the men to defy the laws of the country. In making his award the judge took economic conditions into account. </para>

            <para>- The law of the land should be respected. The honorable- senator knows that arbitration legislation .was advocated by the Labour party many years ago with a view to the avoidance of strikes. Experience has shown that the arbitration system has prevented strikes only when the award has favoured the employees. Now, that the court is taking economic conditions into account, there is a defiance of the law. The executive of the Australian Workers Union has been sitting on a rail in connexion with the shearers&#39; dispute, as it did when there was trouble at South Johnstone some time ago. On that occasion industry was paralysed because the executive of the Australian Workers Union was afraid. to deal with about twenty men. </para>

If the Australian Workers Union had the moral courage to face the existing industrial position in a fair-minded spirit, thinking only of the best interests of its members and of the community generally, it would issue definite instructions for the men to obey the award. It is acting immorally if it misleads union ists, as was done in the timber industry, and forces many families into a state of semi-starvation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> knows as well as I do that there is no better paid industry in Australia than the shearing industry. </para>

He was not able to cite a single injustice that their retention would inflict on any unionist who obeys the law. I do not see how their application can in any way degrade or single out for special punishment anybody who keeps within the law. I admit that the Government is endeavouring to make the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as workable as possible, but I can see no reason why these paragraphs should be omitted from the principal act. </para>

          <para>. -  I hope that the committee will not agree to the Government&#39;s proposal to omit paragraphsj,k andl of subsection1 of section 60. . Some years ago, when a royal commission was inquiring into the working of the Navigation Act, it took a lot of evidence in Queensland and had concrete evidence submitted to it indicating how the law, as stated in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-section 1 of section 60, can be avoided. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> provides that the court may order the registration of an organization to be cancelled if it appears that for any reason the registration ought to be cancelled. At the little port of Mourilyan, the waterside workers, although they were working under an award of the Arbitration Court, had a rule that they should not shift more than 15 tons of cargo in an hour. Evidence was given to the royal commission that on one occasion when a piece of machinery weighing more than 15 tons was raised from the hold in ten minutes, the waterside workers sat down and smoked their pipes for the balance of the hour. Again at Bowen we found that there was nothing in a national sense to prevent the tomato-growers from driving their wagons to tie ship&#39;s side so that the tomatoes could be loaded direct to the ship, but it was not allowed. The tomatoes had to be loaded on to trucks at the end of the wharf, and the waterside workers pushed the trucks to the ship&#39;s side. When objection was taken before the Arbitration Court to the existence of such local rules, the federal representatives of the organization could always declare that there was nothing in the rules to which objection could be taken, and that they could not control the rules of their branches. The court, while admitting that the branches were acting in an irregular manner and in defiance of its award, could only declare that it did not propose to punish the good men in Melbourne and Sydney who were observing the conditions laid down in the award of the court. </para>

            <para>- The court had no power to control the wild men of the woods who defied their own organizations. It was on that account that the law was  amended  and the organizations were directed to so amend their rules that these wild men could be disciplined, and others could get a fair deal. If this power is now removed from the act, the rule of the wild men of the woods will be restored. Honorable senators who represent Queensland know what a tremendous difference this amendment of the law has made to industrial operations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has definitely shown that the law, as it now exists, affects only the men who defy it. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> does not hold  a  brief for those who defy the law. </para>

I have tried to show honorable senators that the whole aim of these paragraphs which the Government now seeks to have omitted from section 60 are absolutely inconsistent with any known principle of British law. Assume that the North Queensland members of the Waterside  Workers  Federation commit a breach of the law. The federation itself embraces workers in every port in Australia, and the section gives the Registrar power to seek thg cancellation of the registration of the whole of the federation. </para>

        <para class="block">The Australian Workers Union is federation embracing unskilled workers in various callings. Its members probably work under 40 different awards which would go out of existence if this consequential amendment were not made, and men to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> referred - those who want to obey the law - would be penalized. The innocent would be punished with the guilty. I know of no other legislation that goes so far as the amendment made to the principal act some years ago, which punishes innocent people for what the legislature has deliberately set out as breaches of the law by others. On the cancellation of the registration of an organization, it becomes a voluntary association. Those who are acquainted with company law know what that means. The organization loses its corporate entity. Honorable senators would not suggest the deregistration of another corporate entity, such as an insurance company, because its agents have been found guilty of misrepresentation or have committed flagrant breaches of the law in that regard; then on what logical ground can they justify their proposal to destroy the corporate entity of a trade organization because of a breach of an award by some section of it? I can understand the majority suffering disadvantages because a minority has brought about a breach of contract, a condition precedent to the establishment of which contract being the requirement that the whole of the parties should abide by it. I can understand the argument that if some have broken away from the contract it should cease. But I cannot appreciate any justification for departing so far from the principles of British justice as to suggest that all the members of an organization should be penalized, as proposed by honorable senators opposite. If, however, they succeed in retaining paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">j k,</inline> andl, I trust that they will agree to a consequential amendment of section 60 in order to protect the property of organizations and maintain awards applying to those sections of the organizations which are not, directly or indirectly, concerned in the particular matter in dispute. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Westr ern Australia) &#91;12.11&#93;. - If the arguments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has now advanced are the reasons which actuated the Government in proposing to alter the law by the removal of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">j, k,</inline> andl from sub-section 1 of section 60, which relates to applications for cancellation of the registration of organizations, I submit, with all due respect, that the Government has acted under an entire misapprehension of the meaning of these paragraphs. They were inserted by the previous Government for a very good reason. Previously, the act dealt with organizations as a whole, and most of the federal organizations are federations with federal councils and federal rules; but they also have State branches and even sub-branches within the States. The rules of a federation certainly apply to the whole organization, and it was found that no cause of action would lie against the organization on the ground that its rules did not comply with the law, but that the rules of the branches, which they had power to make, could be drawn up in defiance of what was laid down in awards made by the Arbitration Court, and often in direct opposition to those awards. </para>

            <para>- That is exactly what these provisions were intended to do. Two outstanding instances showed the need for them. They both occurred in connexion with maritime industries. The Seamen&#39;s Union, and the Waterside Workers Federation, are both corporate unions with branches. Senators Reid and H. E. Elliott have told us that these branches have local rules in defiance of, and in opposition to, what is laid down in awards of the Arbitration Court. It is within the power of each federation to discipline its branches. It can expel a branch and declare that it has ceased to be a branch, if it does not conform with what is laid down by the federation itself. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.He is a member of the federation, but, in actual fact, according to the rules of the federation, he is a member of a branch. On many occasions, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> will be able to tell the Leader of the Senate, the Australian Workers Union has been obliged to discipline its branches. I remember also what happened when the Waterside Workers Federation approached the Arbitration Court a year or two ago. When attention was directed to the fact that the local rules of its branches were made in defiance of an award of the court, the court immediately required the federation to give an undertaking that it would make its branches conform to the law. Unless these provisions are retained, the executives of organizations such as the Australian Workers Union and the Waterside Workers Federation will be powerless. Local branches may adopt rules which will be in complete defiance of the awards of the court. These paragraphs were inserted designedly; they were intended to compel branches, as well as industrial federations, to conform to the law. If my amendment is carried, there will be no need to insert in sub-section 6 the safeguard suggested by the Leader of the Senate. Sub-section 1a reads - - </para>
        <para>Where the ground of the application is &#39; a defect in the rules of the organization, the court may, if in its discretion it thinks fit, instead of ordering the registration of the organization . to be cancelled in the first instance direct the organization within a specified time to alter its rules so as to bring them into conformity with the requirements of the act; and if at the expiration of the time specified the rules have not been altered accordingly, the court may then order the registration of the organization to&#39; be can- . cancelled, and it shall be cancelled accordingly. </para>
        <para>If a branch of an organization adopts rules which are in defiance of an award of the court, the court may give the executive a specified time, perhaps a fortnight or a month, within which to compel the branch in question to so alter its rules as to bring them into conformity with the order or award of the court. If at the expiration of that period the rules are not altered accordingly, the court may then proceed to cancel the registration of the union. No one can suggest that it is unjust to require any organization to conform to the law of the land. </para>

In every case, the court has declined to proceed with the making of an award until the branches or members concerned were disciplined. I well remember the case of the Waterside Workers Federation. The executive of that body had an application before the court in connexion with an industrial dispute, and when the representative of the employers pointed out that certain members of the federation were acting in defiance of an award of the court, the judge not only refrained from dealing with the application, but called upon the executive to discipline the members concerned, otherwise he would consider taking action against the executive itself. The rules of every union give to the executive power to discipline members, and the rules of every federation contain provisions empowering the federation to discipline its branches. </para>

He also argued that if an industrial federation, such as the waterside workers&#39; organization, took this action, the provisions in sub-section1a would operate.

If they are not altered the court may cancel the registration of the organization. For example, the Adelaide branch of the Australian Workers Union may be entirely opposed to a stoppage of work, &#39;but if&#39; a substantial number of its members decide to disobey the law, not only is the position of the Adelaide branch in danger, but also that of the whole of its members and of the federation itself.

            <para>- Yes; if the servant is acting within the scope of his  employment; but our legislation does&#39; not provide for the cancellation of the company&#39;s entity for the act of its servant. In this respect, the position of a company does not differ from that of an individual. If, for example, I instruct my servant to do certain things, and if, within the scope of his employment, the servant causes damage, I am liable. But in the case of industrial organizations, liability is imposed upon the executive for even the unauthorized acts of its members. An organization may order its members to work, but if they refuse, the Registrar may move for the cancellation of registration. </para>

          <para>. - I am strongly in favour of retaining the provisions contained in paragraphs /, <inline font-style="italic">lc</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">I.</inline> We see, in the ^present position of the pastoral industry, the need for the provisions in paragraph Clause 2 states the objects of the act will now include the promotion of goodwill in industry by conciliation and arbitration.  I  have always had a high respect for the Australian Workers Union, which has been ably led for many years by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> for whom I have a high personal regard. That organization has generally been well advised to obey awards of the court, and it has always stood on the side of arbitration. It should be remembered, however, that, hitherto, awards made by the court generally have been to the advantage cif the employees.  The position to-day is different. After a thorough investigation of the conditions in the pastoral industry, Chief Judge Dethridge recently made an award which does not find favour with members of the Australian Workers Union, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> remains silent while many members of the organization in question are disobeying the very law which they helped to make. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has had an opportunity. to express his views, and should allow me to do the same without interruption. What is the attitude of the Australian Workers Union to-day? It is silent. Most of the members of that organization are anxious to work under award rates, at which they can earn from &#163;7 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> a week under reasonably pleasant conditions. For.tunately, a majority of the nien have sufficient sense to work at the rates awarded by the court; but a large number out west are on strike, and there are many others in Melbourne, Sydney, and elsewhere, awaiting some direction from the executive of the Australian Workers Union. It is the duty of those in control of that organization to tell its members that they must obey the laws of the country. I am aware that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly),</inline> and most of his supporters, believe in conciliation and arbitration; but one honorable senator occupying a seat on the front bench has been inciting members of the Australian Workers Union not to accept the award of the court, and consequently to disobey a law of the country. </para>

I submit that, in discussing this provision, which relates to the cancellation of the registration of an organization, the conduct of any particular honorable senator in connexion, with an industrial dispute cannot, by any stretch of imagination, bc connected with that subject. If this practice is to be permitted, it will naturally lead to an acrimonious debate, which we all wish to avoid. I submit that the honorable senator is quite in order in referring to the action of an organization, and in asking Parliament to grant the court more extensive disciplinary powers; but that he is not in order in referring to the action of an individual member of this committee, or of any organization, which cannot influence the members of that organization in the slightest degree. </para>

            <para>- I shall confine my remarks to the failure of the Australian Workers Union to direct its members to obey the award of the court. A great many of these men are  defying the laws of the country, as did the timber-workers with disastrous results, not only to themselves, but to the poor, unfortunate women and children dependent upon them. It has been said that Chief Judge Dethridge was not justified in making the award. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eae</inline> said that the industry was sufficiently prosperous to pay the high wages which the shearers have enjoyed for many years. It is about time we faced economic facts in this country. The average price of wool in Australia for the past twelve months has been approximately 10&#188;d. a lb., and during the last three months 9&#189;d. per lb. </para>

I ask if, at this juncture, the honorable senator is in order in discussing the economic position of the wool industry, which is not in any way related to the subject of whether an industrial organization should or should not be de-registered. A strike is an offence against the law. The justification for a certain award is not a proper subject to discuss under this clause which relates merely to whether in certain circumstances the registration of industrial organizations should be cancelled. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to reply to one argument raised in support of the retention of these paragraphs, and to make a point, which to me is very definite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> E. Elliott said that in connexion with an industrial dispute which occurred in Mourilyan, in Queensland, the local branch of the organization disobeyed an award of the court. Supposing that local branch had been expelled by the organization, and the members resolved, even if they had been &#34; disciplined &#34; by the parent organization, to act unitedly. They could still continue to act as an organized body with exactly the same power industrially as before. In such circumstances the position would probably be worse, because they would be unfettered by any association with the organization. It has been argued that these paragraphs, if retained, will provide a method to discipline, not only individual members, but also groups of members or branches; but they will not do anything of the kind. The accusation of an honorable senator opposite that I have been inciting men in the pastoral industry to strike has no foundation in fact. The men spontaneously refused to work under an award of the court. </para>

            <para>- That is another matter. What occurred subsequently was the result of the joint action of these men whomI said spontaneously refused to accept work, and asked their fellow workers in other localities to help them. It was not the organization as such that directly or indirectly incited the men. I am not <inline font-style="italic">persona grata</inline> with the Austalian Workers Union. That organization will not have me at any price. It is ridiculous to suggest that the organization can be bound by the action of some of its members. I unequivocally assert that the objection to the award was a spontaneous act on the part of the men who subsequently came together to oppose it. In what way can the organization be held responsible for their action? What would be the effect of attempting to discipline the men individually? Any one who attempted to do so would be laughed at. I say more power to them. They should not be expected to work under such an atrocious award. </para>

      <para class="block">The proposed new section  61,  as printed, provides that a member shall be entitled to resign if he accepts employment in an industry other than that to which the dispute or matter relates ; but that otherwise he may not resign during the pendency of any dispute. In practice, that means compulsory membership of an organization. It is a practice of the bigger unions to file another plaint as soon as an award has been given. They do not necessarily go on with it; but the filing of the plaint gives them a hold on their members, because no member may resign while that plaint is before the court. Seeing that the plaint may never be proceeded with, members of a union are committed to a life-long membership. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said that this is a free country. </para>

          <para>- It is not a free country if a man cannot please himself whether or not he should remain a member of a union. I have always believed that a man should join the organization representing his craft, trade, or calling. I believe so still. But, after all, it is a matter of opinion. Another man might conscientiously believe otherwise: if he does he should be allowed to remain outside an organization. He. may disagree with the policy of a union. For instance, a member of a political trade union might conscientiously find himself unable to. endorse the policy of the Labour party. Under the bill, he would be compelled to remain a member of the union, and to  contribute towards its funds, which might be used for political purposes. If he cannot conscientiously remain a member of that union, he should be free to resign from it, so long as he gives due notice and pays all fees to the date of his resignation. </para>

          <para>. -  I ask the committee to consider the vital nature of this amendment. Prior to the last amending act, there was a provision which precluded a member from resigning from an organization during the pendency of a dispute. There were good reasons for that provision. Questions of jurisdiction, or of the cost of proceedings, might arise.For some unknown reason the late Government omitted that particular section when introducing its amending legislation. This Government desires to restore it. I submit that it should be restored unless some very strong reasons are advanced for not doing so. There are about 700,000 trade unionists in Australia today. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to point to one complaint that he has received concerning this provision. </para>

            <para>- I challenge the right honorable senator to name one complaint that has been made as a result of the operation of this provision. I recognize that honorable senators  On  this side have to accept so much of the bill as the Opposition chooses to give them. I suggest to the Leader and members of the Opposition that this is not the class of amendment that will create that good feeling that should exist between this and another place. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition said, &#34; Of course, the unionist might join another industry.&#34; The proposed new section enables him to do so. All that it asks is that during the pendency of any dispute or matter before the court, no resignation shall take effect &#34; unless the member accepts employment in an industry other than that to which the dispute or matter relates.&#34; Certainly no adequate reasons have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in support of his amendment. The very cases mentioned by the right honorable senator are covered by the proposed new section. A man may resign from his union if he so desires. Nearly every trade union in Australia has rules that have been passed by the Industrial Registrar, and its members enter into a contract that no resignation shall take effect until three months after notice in writing has been given; certainly not during the pendency of a dispute. The proposed new section seeks to bring this legislation into conformity with the accepted practice that has prevailed for something like a quarter of a century, a practice that was wiped out, I admit, by amending legislation some months ago. Unless good grounds can be advanced against the reinstatement of this principle, I suggest that the majority in the Senate will simply be exercising the discretion that it possesses in an arbitrary, as opposed to a truly legislative manner. The new section which we propose does not permit of any very great debate. I put it to the Opposition that it might easily have been allowed to remain in the principal act. The only people who will be affected are members of trade union organizations, whom honorable senators on this side represent. I repeat, the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition has no mandate or instruction from any trade unionists in Australia to insist upon the proposed new section being rejected by the Senate. I ask honorable senators not to vote on the amendment on purely party lines, but in the proper spirit in which each one of them should approach his duties in this Senate. </para>

          <para>.  -  This clause makes it obligatory upon organizations to keep a record of their members, and to furnish copies of it to the court at stated periods. That procedure would involve the organizations concerned in a great deal of work and expense, without effecting any really useful purpose. Large organizations would be forced to have typed from their office records copies of their list of members, which would have to be lodged with the Registrar. In the case of those organizations whose membership is of a migratory nature, lists that were lodged would be obsolete almost before they reached the office of the Registrar. I suggest that, instead of asking organizations to submit a list of their members to the Registrar, the bill should provide that they be instructed to keep  3uch  records available at their offices, open to inspection by any authorized persons, as prescribed by the act.

            <para>- But not under the conditions which apply to trade unions. At this time of depression the extra typing involved in having to supply these lists of members is an item to be considered. The unionists are prepared to make available at their offices lists which any one entitled to do so may inspect al any time. Surely that should be sufficient. These lists will only be required when proof of membership has to be given, and that proof can be obtained readily enough from the records at &#39;the union offices. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Western Australia)  &#91;2.50&#93;. -  This amendment has been sprung on the committee, and I should like to have a little time to consider the effect of it ; but speaking on the spur of the moment, it occurs to me that there is at least one good reason why these lists of members of unions should be filed with the Registrar. It is the decision of the High Court that awards of the Arbitration Court apply to the members of the organizations who are parties to the cases upon which the court has adjudicated. If proof should be required of a man&#39;s membership of any particular organization, the test can be applied by a scrutiny of the list of members of the organization on the file in the Registrar&#39;s office. If the man has joined the union since the list has been furnished, the onus of proof of his membership rests upon the organization. A member of an organization is compelled by the bill, as now amended by this committee, to notify his employer of the union of which he is a member. The committee has retained that provision in the act for a very good reason. Employers are often obliged to differentiate among their employees, who belong to different unions. There may be two grades of workers, one working under an award rate of 15s., and the other under an award rate of 16s., and a man may say that he is a member of the union whose rate is 16s. The list of members on file at the Registrar&#39;s office affords to the employer an opportunity to check the man&#39;s statement. I do not think that there will be very much expense involved in supplying these lists. The Australian Workers Union has various branches, and each branch, I presume, keeps a record of its members, and a list of all transfers from one district to another. In the Carpenters Union to which I belonged the members&#39; roll was kept continuously. Copies were furnished to the . central office at regular periods, showing all transfers, arrivals, and departures. It is only necessary to type several copies of the membership roll, and forward two of them, to the central office, one of which can bepassed on to the Registrar. </para>

        <para>SenatorRAE  (New South Wales) &#91;2.56&#93;. - I do not think the matter is quite so simple as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> states. Many of the members of the Australian Workers Union, which extends over the whole of the Commonwealth, are of the nomadic class, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> has pointed out, a list of the members of the organization would always be more or less incorrect, because of the changes of address that are constantly taking place. If I am a resident of New South Wales I may, if I think fit, become a member of the Adelaide branch, and subsequently may transfer from Adelaide to Brisbane, while still remaining a resident of New South Wales. </para>

          <para>- A membership spread all over Australia takes a lot of sorting out, and a lot of time is occupied in preparing a list of the members of an organization so wide-spread. Even while the work of preparing the list is in progress changes take place; deaths frequently occur. In any case, a list of members is not of much value, because it is the commonest of things for shearers, in particular, to change their names. </para>

In the meantime, I may get a very much better job. I may, however, meet a mate looking for a pen, and may say to him, &#34; Use my name and take mypen ; take the whole box and dice.&#34; He then goes shearing under my name for the time being. He may be Bill Jones in one shed and Tom Brown in the next. This practice has, to my knowledge, been followed for over 45 years. I have not done it myself; but I would not hesitate to do it if necessary. Seamen do the same frequently, and I daresay that it is done in other callings. If a man does not value his own particular name, I do not see why he should not take another if it is more convenient, so long as there is no criminal intent. </para>

I do not intend to play the part of censor of honorable member&#39;s speeches.

Even at this late hour in the discussion of this measure the Government and its supporters are entitled to some say as to the treatment to be accorded to the bill. These provisions will not affect the manufacturers or pastoralists, but if these amendments moved by honorable senators opposite are persisted in they will seriously interfere with the administration of trade union organizations.

It is a wellknown practice in trade union organizations during industrial disputes to intimidate persons who wish to work in accordance with awards of the court. I know it will be said that there is sufficient power under State laws to meet any situation that may arise; and I realize that we have to rely upon State  authorities to police many laws passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. It should, however, be obvious to everyone that the federal industrial code should contain provisions for the protection of those persons who wish to work in accordance with its laws.

            <para>- Yes. The trouble is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> pointed out in connexion with the Transport Workers Act, that the Commonwealth has been making gestures and legislating under its trade and commerce powers and under its conciliation and arbitration powers. The Crown Law officers, who were supported by a King&#39;s Counsel, drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that it was extremely dangerous to prosecute Garden under this section. If all the members of the Employers Federation were lawyers, they would realize how ineffectual is legislation of this nature, and it should not be on the statute-book. But, because they happen to be laymen and believe that there is something in it, sections such as that which it is now proposed to delete are included. The Government desires to direct the attention of the people to the limited constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in this respect, and to impress upon Parliament the necessity to cease making gestures of this kind. </para>

            <para>- The Minister directed his attention to section 86a; but it is also proposed to repeal 86b, which imposes a penalty if an organization or a &#39;branch of an organization imposes a penalty of any kind upon a member, because he has worked in accordance with the terms of an award of the court. Section 86d provides that any person who publishes any report encouraging or inciting men to commit a breach or nonobservance of this act shall be guilty of an offence. I understand that, at the moment, a prosecution is pending concerning an alleged offence under that section. If our arbitral power is incomplete, the whole of our industrial legislation is unconstitutional. </para>

          <para>. -  When the last bill to amend our arbitration legislation was before Parliament a number of alterations were made, principally in the direction of creating new offences and providing elaborate penalties for them. Since that time one of the most disastrous strikes which Australia has experienced has taken place. I refer to the timber-workers&#39; strike. During that strike a number of pmployers came to Canberra to beg the then Attorney-General to prosecute various persons under the federal law. Every honorable senator knows that they were advised to go back to Sydney and prosecute the persons concerned under the State law. In the light of that happening, what is the use of pretending that these provisions mean anything? They mean nothing and, therefore, we might as well abandon them. </para>

            <para>- Every prosecution under that legislation has failed. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> suggests that these penalties should he omitted, and that the States should accept the responsibility for prosecuting for offences against the federal law.  His  argument supports the contention that the Commonwealth should vacate the field of arbitration legislation. If we cannot enforce our laws, we should not pass them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> admits that it is the function of the State to prosecute in industrial cases. In that case we only humbug ourselves as well as the people when we say that the Commonwealth should control industrial matters. It is improper , to pass laws imposing penalties which cannot be enforced. </para>

Certainly the last Arbitration Act, which was passed in a period of violent reaction, was a charter of slavery for the organized workers of this country. If honorable senators opposite, by means of their majority, intend to retain the slavery provisions, then so far as I am concerned, I say to them &#34; Take the bill ; I wash my hands of it.

            <para>- I did not say that honorable senators opposite were reactionary; but that their reactionary crew - either those whom they employ, or those who employ them - are reactionary. However, if the term is unparliamentary, I withdraw it. In a shearing dispute which arose in 1922  -  before this reaction ary legislation to which we are now trying to give a semblance of decency was enacted - I was prosecuted on an absurd charge of instigating a strike. The strike occurred before I took a hand in it, although I admit that I did my best to make it a success. </para>

            <para>- I do not care whether there was or not. I resisted the award which, in my opinion, was an abominable one. When I appeared in court - it was a State court - the magistrate asked me how I pleaded. I told him that I refused to plead, because I realized that no socialist could expect to get justice. I said that I knew how the case would go, because, in the courts of the land, a man was frequently convicted before he was tried. My prediction was correct; for, almost immediately, the magistrate ordered me to pay a fine of &#163;100 or be imprisoned for nine months. I appealed against his decision; but it was upheld by the District Court. I did not, however, pay the fine; nor did I go to gaol. I wrote to the then Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, and told him that any government which attempted to collect a fine of that nature should be ashamed of itself. I asked him why a man on one side of an imaginary line could do with impunity what would be regarded as a crime if done by a man on the other side of that line. My fine was remitted. I contend that these provisions are a part of a code of legalized slavery of the organized workers of Australia. Such legislation I view with abhorrence and contempt. Even if these provisions are multiplied one hundredfold I shall, at every opportunity, when it is worth while to do so, disobey them and defy all the courts in the land to prevent me from exercizing my right as a free citizen to advise men to accept or to reject work. </para>

            <para>- I do ; but, unless a law is founded on justice, I have no respect for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays said that the law is brought into contempt if there is no power to enforce it. I tell him - and I speak as one who is intimately acquainted with the workers, and whose acquaintance with them is up to date - that among the great mass of the workers there is already the utmost contempt for the class legislation passed by this Parliament. With the exception of the legislation passed when the Labour party has been in power, the great bulk of our laws have been enacted by men who have not only refused to give justice to the workers, but have also brought in repressive legislation to help the &#34;boodlers&#34; to exploit the wage-earners. I am only voicing the opinion of the great mass of workers in this country when I say that the great mass of the laws passed by the various parliaments of Australia, so far as they relate to the dealings between one class and another class in the community, are held by them in the utmost contempt. When honorable senators opposite talk about class hatred and conciliation, I ask that those who are responsible for the present terrible condition of the workers shall show some true conciliatory spirit, and a desire to be friendly, instead of the conciliation which reminds one of the spider&#39;s invitation to the fly. When they are prepared to treat the workers justly, the workers may have some respect for the law. But until that time comes they cannot do so. The workers will obey repressive legislation only so far as the whip of necessity compels them to do so. </para>

During the long debate this morning, we heard several references by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> to the necessity for preserving the traditions of British justice. Here it is contemplated to appoint an officer with all the powers of a judge to determine issues which will vitally affect not only the fortunes but the livelihood of people. Yet it is provided, contrary, I suggest, to any of the principles of British justice, that that officer shall be subject to summary dismissal by the Attorney-General, and that he shall not be reinstated except by a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. The Attorney-General will know when he makes a suspension that, on party lines, one House will be entirely behind him. I invite the Leader of the Government in the Senate to explain how he can reconcile with the traditions of British justice the appointment of an officer who is given the power to judge, and who is to be subject to summary dismissal by the Attorney-General, without any possibility of redress. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. The Attorney-General is the leader of the Bar, the head of the legal fraternity of Australia. If he did not act consistently with the principles of British government, goodness knows who would. He may suspend a conciliation commissioner from office for misbehaviour or incapacity. There is nothing extraordinary about that. He will not suspend such an officer excepting for misbehaviour or incapacity. A similar provision has operated in the&#34; various States in connexion with the wages board system. He suspends the commissioner for proven misbehaviour or incapacity. No Attorney-General would take upon himself to suspend a commissioner until some tribunal had heard him in defence and had held the charge of misbehaviour or incapacity to be proved. To show conclusively that there must be an inquiry before a suspension, it is further provided in the proposed new section that - </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>HAL COLEBATCH  (Western Australia) &#91;4.12&#93;.  -  I cannot understand the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> In order to test it, let us suppose that an amendment is made in the act under which the Auditor-General is appointed by which he may be suspended and not restored to his office unless by the direct motion of both Houses of Parliament. Yet that is exactly the position set up by this clause, exactly the opposite to the procedure that must be adopted in removing judges or an Auditor-General. A judge may not be removed except upon a motion carried in both Houses of Parliament. Under this bill a conciliation commissioner, a person who is acting as a judge, may be removed from his office, and his removal stands if it is endorsed by only one House, whereas my amendment provides that if either House says that a commissioner must be restored to his office, he is automatically restored to it without any reference to the Governor-General. He does not come into the picture until a commissioner is to be permanently removed. The position I want established is that which we have always maintained in regard tothe framing of ordinances or regulations - that either House shall be at liberty to disallow an ordinanceor regulation. I say that either House should be at liberty to disallow the suspension from office of a person exercising the responsible position of a judge. It is idle to suggest that I am trying to set up something contrary to the practice in regard to judges and the Auditor-General, when, as a matter of fact, I am endeavouringto preserve the position that neither a judge nor an Auditor-General may be dismissed from office except with the concurrence of both Houses of Parliament.. The position I want to set up is that a commissioner exercising the functions of a judge shall not be dismissed unless both Houses concur, and I do so by means of my amendment, which makes it competent for either House to insist upon the restoration of the suspended commissioner to his office. </para>

          <para class="block">Honorable senators will recall that when this scheme was under discussion one night last week, objections were voiced to the Government&#39;s proposal, and I  agreed to consider the question of a compromise. I believe the proposed new section will effectively overcome the difficulties then mentioned.&#39; It is proposed that an appeal shall lie to the court constituted by the Chief Judge and not less than two other judges. Honorable senators will agree that it will be better to have three judges to determine appeals. The conciliation commissioners are to be invested with certain powers, but under this provision they will not be authorized to do any thing that may affect the standard of hours, wages or conditions in industry. The fear was expressed by honorable senators who objected to the original provisions that the conciliation commissioners might, by their decisions, destroy the whole industrial scheme of wage fixation, and finally I agreed to  compromise  by providing for what I might term a correctional jurisdiction. As honorable senators will note, it is intended that any appeal affecting wages, hours or conditions of employment shall be made in the manner and within the time prescribed. The court may take fresh evidence before determining the appeal, and it may confirm., quash or vary an award or part of an award; it may refer the award or order back- to the Conciliation Commissioner or conciliation committee, with, or without, directions or suggestions, or it may make an order dealing with the matter under appeal. There is also the stipulation that no such award or order shall include any provision outside the powers of the Conciliation Commissioner or conciliation committee. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition has circulated an amendment which he desires to move to the proposed new section. Perhaps it would be convenient to refer to them at this stage. The right honorable gentleman, I understand, accepts sub-section 1 of the proposed new section, but intends to move to insert after the words &#34; public interest &#34; the words &#34; or substantially prejudice the interests of the employers or employees in the industry&#34;. The subsection would then read - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">I suggest that the correctional jurisdiction should only be exercised when it is necessary to correct what has been done in relation to industries generally. If the appellate tribunal enters into the whole field proper for investigation by these conciliation tribunals, it will merely be duplicating the work. I cannot, therefore, accept the honorable gentleman&#39;s amendment. It would, to use a colloquial term, be the means of &#34;whiteanting&#34; the scheme that the Government has in mind in connexion with an appellate tribunal. As it would be ineffective I would sooner withdraw my amendment , and stand by the bill. The second amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is to leave out proposed sub-section 2 and insert the following new sub-section: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Any such appeal shall be made in the manner and within the time prescribed by the rules made in accordance with section 43 of this act. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">As this is consistent with the other provisions of the bill the Government has no objection to it. The Leader of the Opposition also proposes to insert after clause 24a, the following new clause : - &#34;24b. After section thirty-one a of the principal act the following section is inserted: - 31ab. - (1.) An award or order of a Conciliation Commissioner or a Conciliation Committee shall, unless an appeal against any provision of the award or order has been made, have effect upon the expiration of the time within which such appeal may be made. (2.) Where any such appeal is made, . the award or order shall not come into effect pending the determination of the appeal by the court, or by the Conciliation Commissioner or Conciliation Committee, as the case may be, after reconsideration &#39;.&#34; </para>
        <para class="block">At present all the applications made are for a reduction in wages. Under this proposal by the Leader of the Opposition, such applications would go before a conciliation commissioner, and if he prescribed a reduction the organization concerned would need only to make an appeal and the old award would continue in operation until the appeal had been heard. Although that argument is against the policy of the party which I represent, it is my duty to inform the committee concerning the whole position. Some honorable senators have spoken concerning the necessity to reduce wages, and of the applications made to the Arbitration Court in that direction. I remind honorable senators, however, that they are voting with their eyes wide open, and that if this amendment is adopted and a conciliation commissioner should reduce wages, a reduction would be postponed until such time as the court dealt with the matter. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Is it suggested that the court shall have power to make a retrospective award? Both employers and employees are opposed to retrospective awards because they create too rauch uncertainty, and tend towards chaotic conditions in industry which should not exist. At present it appears that if this amendment is adopted it would operate in favour of the party&#39; I represent, but because it destroys the general purposes of this court I am not prepared to accept it. If the committee adopts it it must take the responsibility. The Government is opposed to setting up such an appellate tribunal. The Government believes that a better course would be for  the  employers and employees, with the assistance of an independent  chairman,  to settle the matter in dispute without utilizing the arbitral powers provided in the measure. The Government fully realizes that it is in a minority in this chamber, and instead of biting at the shadow and missing the bone, is not prepared to give way even if, in doing so, it would allay the fears of honorable senators who feel that in this amendment there will be some check upon conciliation commissioners who may run riot and cause industrial chaos. I wish honorable senators to understand that the Government&#39;s compromise, if acceptable to the Opposition, will be embodied in the legislation: If it is not it is useless to discuss it, and the Government will stand by the bill as it was presented. &#34;We have reached the stage that the only point in dispute is that the Opposition asks for a postponement of a determination until an appeal is heard. From the point of view of the Opposition, which represents mainly - I do not say it disparagingly - the interest of the employers </para>

            <para>- May I say the Opposition watches the interests of the em ployers? Nothing can be gained by accepting the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think any one suggests that during the next two years at least any applications will be made to the court for increased wages, and unless such applications are made there is no possibility of the amended provision operating to the detriment of the employers. All these provisions are more or less experimental. </para>

            <para>- I do not know. If this amendment is carried, quite apart from what I have already said, it will tend to encourage inefficiency in the court. Under the proposal of the Government the court is given power to quash or vary an award. If a conciliation commissioner violated a principle of industrial justice an application to the court would result in what has happened in dozens of cases. The court would treat the matter as urgent and deal with it immediately; but if a provision such as that suggested by the Leader of the Opposition is inserted and an application were made a day or two before the vacation there would be no urgent necessity to deal with it because the old determination would remain in operation. The application would not be dealt with perhaps for several months. There will be no encouragement for the court to reach finality in cases which should be proceeded with. In the opinion of the Government it is really an instruction to the court to delay its work. Seeing that the Opposition has nothing to lose, I trust that in this instance it will be able to meet the Government. I cannot see that there is much to be gained by insisting upon the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. Under the compromise suggested by the Government the appellate tribunal has power to quash or vary an award, but under the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition there is a glorious uncertainty from the time an award is made until an appeal is decided as to what wages are to be. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE (Western Australia) &#91;4.43&#93;. - The opposition to the main provisions of clause 9 is founded upon the fundamental objection that the Government under the guise of appointing conciliation commissioners is establishing another arbitral tribunal. We&#39; contend that they are not conciliation commissioners at all, but arbitration judges without the qualifications of judges. What is the object of the Government? It has been shown that the Arbitration Court is not overworked. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has borne testimony to that by saying that the court has  so  little work to  do  that one of the judges has been transferred to the Bankruptcy Court, and another is doing other work. In these circumstances it cannot be said that conciliation commissioners are to be appointed because the Arbitration Court is unable to deal with the cases before it. If they were to be real conciliation commissioners without arbitral power the position would be different. How can they be conciliators, and at the same time arbitrators ? Under the guise of appointing conciliation commissioners the Government is setting up additional industrial tribunals, and because of this objection it is thought that possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> might be able to compromise. He has now brought forward this proposal for an appeal from the so-called conciliation commissioners to the three arbitration judges. But it is to be an appeal limited to awards or orders affecting wages or hours, or conditions of employment, which, in the opinion of the court, are likely to affect the public interest. </para>

If it is not to be an effective appeal, we might as well give the conciliation commissioners full arbitral powers. If the appeal is to be a mere shadow, let us accept the bill as it stands, for what is the use of agreeing to words that mean nothing? The words in my proposed amendment would mean something. If it can be established that an award of the conciliation committee or of the conciliation commissioners prejudicially affects the interests of employers or employees in the industry, then a right of appeal will lie. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.The Opposition is satisfied with the arbitration judges who are available. Its members have not asked for the appointment of conciliation commissioners. They claim that it is not necessary to set up further cumbersome machinery to deal with industrial disputes. </para>
        <para>During the election campaign, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> said that the Labour party was in favour of a more business-like system of dealing with industrial disputes, and that, if returned to power, it would free the existing legislation from its entangling legalisms. Let us see what we shall have if these conciliation committees or conciliation commissioners are appointed. The conciliation committees will have power to make awards. Under the existing act, conciliation committees cannot make awards, although they can make agreements which, later, may be registered as awards. The bill also provides that the conciliation commissioners may make awards. Under the existing act arbitration judges also may make awards. The position is, therefore, that with this legislation on the statute-book there will be three bodies, each of which  may make awards. That is the Government&#39;s business-like way of dealing with industrial matters! </para>
        <para>There is another real difficulty which is not dealt with in the bill. In the event of an industrial dispute taking place, who is to decide which of these three bodies is to deal with it? The VicePresident of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> is, temporarily, out of the chamber; I, therefore, invite any of the supporters of the Government to point to a clause in the bill which deals with that question. </para>

            <para>- Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> has joined the optimists&#39; league. He appears to have forgotten that the bill contemplates disputes, because the conciliation commissioners may deal with disputes. Indeed that will be the purpose of their appointment. Since no honorable senator opposite has answered my question, I now put it to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who has returned. Seeing that under this proposal three different bodies - conciliation committees, conciliation commissioners and arbitration judges - may deal with industrial disputes, the Opposition would like to know who will decide to which body a dispute will be referred? </para>

At present the Chief Judge says that, say Judge Beeby, or Judge Drake-Brockman, will deal with a particular dispute, or that he himself will deal with it.

            <para>- The Government does not propose to dispense altogether with the arbitration judges, for it proposes to use them to deal with appeals. In certain circumstances, there can be an appeal from the conciliation committees, or the conciliation commissioners to judges of the Arbitration Court nothwithstanding that the conciliation commissioners also have arbitral powers. But before there can bean appeal to the arbitration judges, it must be established that there is something in the award or order which is contrary to the public interest. Until that has been established, no industrial dispute can go to an arbitration judge. </para>

            <para>- The Vice President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> meets that point by saying that the Government believes in conciliation in preference to arbitration. Does he think that we, on this side, are so obtuse, and the people of the country so blind, that by his merely labelling these men &#34;conciliation commissioners&#34; the people cannot say that they are arbitrators? Nothing can get away from the fact that these men will, in fact, be arbitrators, not conciliators. The reply of the Minister means that, in the opinion of the Government, there shall be no arbitration in this country in the future, excepting by the gentlemen who will be appointed as conciliation commissioners. The Opposition cannot regard such a state of affairs as satisfactory. It is an imputation that the present judges of the Arbitration Court are either incompetent or partial.We believe that they are both competent and impartial. As they are not overworked, there is no need to set up further industrial tribunals. The Government believes that there is some virtue in conciliation commissioners which we on this side have not yet discovered. It claims to have received a mandate in respect of arbitration legislation. It promised wonderful things in industrial legislation. We, on this side, are prepared to allow the Government to appoint conciliation commissioners; but in the interests of the industries of this country, and of fair play all round, we want a real and effective appeal to the Arbitration Court on questions that come before the commissioners. I, therefore, move - </para>

        <para class="block">I repeat that the Opposition has not asked for these conciliation commissioners. It does not want them ; it believes that there is no need for them; but if the Government sees some virtue in them the Opposition wants something really effective in the way of an appeal to the Arbitration Court so that the industries of this country may have a fair chance. </para>
        <para>I make a further suggestion to the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I feel sure that honorable senators on this side would be willing to agree to the. deletion of the words &#34; which in the opinion of the court is likely to affect the public interest &#34; in sub-section 1. That would leave the ordinary right of appeal, with which the Opposition would be satisfied. As I have already said, we on this side see no necessity for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, but we are prepared to meet the Government in that matter so long as there is an effective right of appeal against the decision of the commissioners. </para>

I ask honorable senators is it honest to say &#34;Yes, we agree with the appointment of conciliation commissioners provided there is to be an unqualified right of appeal. Although there may be a tribunal in the first instance to deal with awards, there must also be an appellate tribunal to deal with the same matter, and in every instance that tribunal will  make another award?&#34; I submit, with great respect, that, if that was the attitude that honorable senators opposite intended to adopt, the more honest course for them to follow would have been to defeat the bill on the second reading. </para>

        <para>It was made perfectly clear to honorable senators during the second-reading debate that the Government reposed greater trust in a tribunal consisting of representatives of the employers and employees, presided over by an independent  chairman,  meeting around a table, than in another presided over by the litigious gentleman to whom&#39; reference has already been made. Honorable senators may call that tribunal what they like, conciliation or arbitration. </para>

Upon what other hypothesis could one explain the attitude of the Opposition in sending the bill into committee other than a desire to consider whether we should introduce a system of round-table conferences. The right honorable the Leader of the Opposition said that he opposed round-table conferences. Of course he does.

Personally, I do not think there is any necessity for a court of appeal. I am strongly of the opinion that the operation of the Flax Bounty Act will convince a good many of the followers of the right honorable senator as to the necessity of setting up conciliation commissioners such as the Government proposes in this bill. I urge honorable senators to consider the open declaration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> against the principle embodied in the Cotton and Flax Bounty Bills. I admire the right honorable senator&#39;s consistency in standing out against the appointment of conciliation commissioners. </para>

            <para>- I am not much concerned whether they are termed conciliators or arbitrators. The Government  desires that industrial disputes shall be settled by conciliation and arbitration, not by conciliation or arbitration. It was pointed out during the second-reading debate that the judges of our Arbitration Court to-day conciliate, and then arbitrate. The defect in that system is that you cannot have conciliation from an authority presided over by a man whose reputation may be absolutely beyond question, but who, by force of circumstances, lives the life of a recluse, and sits in an exalted position, in an atmosphere that does not encourage men to bring out the best that is in them; who develop into plaintiff and defendant, the one fighting to obtain the best that he can, and the other to whittle the advantages down as much as possible. Around a table, where men can talk as men to men, there is a better chance of settling disputes. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I deprecate the attitude adopted by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition. The acceptance of this proposal would merely be pulling the legs of the workers, and those who believe in conciliation. He is agreeable to the appointment of conciliation commissioners, but desires to appoint over them a tribunal which will eventually decide the issue. I concede the right of correcting existing anomalies, of having a tribunal which may act as a deterrent to an over enthusiastic  chairman,  who would realize that over him was a tribunal to which an appeal would lie. I have conceded that right in my amendment. Beyond that I am not prepared to go, and I hope that honorable senators will not force the Government into the position of abandoning the whole scheme of conciliation. As I said in my second-reading speech, I believe there is some hope in that system. It is necessary to face facts. There is something radically wrong with the existing system of arbitration when we have so much disrespect of the law. The confidence of the people is becoming less, instead of greater in the existing system. Every day there is a growing antipathy against that system, and it has become accentuated since the position of the judges was made more permanent. I do not say that in any spirit of partisanship. I invite honorable senators to study the records of the number of days that have been lost through industrial turmoil during the past five years, during which our industrial system has operated, and compare it with the figures for the previous five years. The comparison is appalling. If parties stand by this artificial system of wage fixation, and believe that under it industrial peace can be effected, it is about time that we took stock of our present institution, and decided whether there is not some other means whereby we can inaugurate something calculated to inspire the confidence of both the employers and employees. </para>
        <para>I am surprised at the attitude of the right honorable the Leader of the &#39;Opposition towards this measure generally, but I can quite understand it in view of that which he adopted on the Cotton and Flax Bounty Bills. He then opposed the  i  principles suggested by the Government, and stood out and out for the maintenance of the existing system, which prevents employers and employees getting together to settle their grievances. </para>

It is obvious that we would never have got the majority that we at present have in the Senate if we were returned merely as the representatives of the employers. It is absurd for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to try to divide honorable senators into two sections, and to claim that the members of the Opposition  represent only one section of tie community. The truth is that we are endeavouring to represent all interests fairly and squarely, to balance opposing claims, and to determine matters accordingly. </para>

I acknowledge that there was an undoubted mandate from the people on the occasion of the last election to allow federal arbitration to stay, and to effect some necessary amendments in the machinery. As I interpret the policy speech of the Leader of the Government, the first amendment promised was that the law should be made less penal in its operations. </para>

        <para class="block">And honorable senators have urged that effect should be given to the mandate of the people ; that this bill should be made more conciliatory, and that the principle of conciliation, as applied to our arbitration machinery, should be put into operation. What is the very essence of conciliation but that the parties should come together, as the Leader of the Senate has said, around a table and discuss matters as man to man, their delibera tions guided, directed, aided, and, in many respects, consummated by a  chairman  who can only use the strength of his influence or persuasive powers in order to bring them to an agreement? Settlement is achieved by conciliation, agreement, mutual contact, the creation of goodwill, and the confidence which is engendered by the exchange of views around a table, and by cutting out the entangling legalisms that mark proceedings in a court. I support the Minister up to the hilt in anything that tends to promote the use of the machinery of conciliation, or to so enlarge or improve it that the parties may come together; and the Minister may have his heart&#39;s desire. The way to promote goodwill is by means of conciliation, the exchange of views, the creation of a feeling of confidence, and the arriving at agreements. This bill says that its object is to promote goodwill in industry by conciliation and arbitration. But how has the Government gone about it? It does not propose to appoint as chairmen of conciliation committees men with qualifications, men trained to sift evidence or determine the weight or value of it, men who are by their training peculiarly fitted for that kind of work. </para>

            <para>- I mean men who are trained as judges, or have the qualifications of judges. I do not say that such men are exclusively the best for this particular purpose, because I should only use them in the last resort. I should have conciliation commissioners, but only as conciliation commissioners, and should appoint men of the strongest personality. During the debate on the second reading we were told how the timber-workers&#39; strike was settled by a conference between the parties, because a man of outstanding personality, infinite patience and sound judgment, and one who was trusted by both parties, sat in the chair and conducted the negotiations. All parties agreed that the settlement of that particular dispute in its final stages was due to the conciliatory spirit displayed throughout by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson. We cannot get <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibsons every day, but there are men in this community who are eminently qualified to play the part of conciliation commissioners. If, however, they are endowed with arbitral powers - if they are given the power to come to a final determination or decision - they cease to be conciliation commissioners, and the essence of the spirit of conciliation disappears from the negotiation. I suggest, nevertheless, that even under the wages board system, and with conciliation committees where the  chairman  has the right to give a final determination, after the parties sitting around a table have discussed the matters at issue frankly and candidly, more satisfactory results can be obtained than can be secured in the litigious atmosphere of a court. Under this bill wo may have conciliation committees which may be regarded as analagous to the industrial boards of South Australia or the wages boards of Victoria. But when we pass from the conciliation committee to the conciliation commissioner we pass to something which is in its nature an inferior Arbitration Court. If the Leader of the Government in the Senate says that the Government has a mandate to free the arbitration system from &#34;entangling legalisms&#34;, I am ready to help him. If he says that he wants to get rid of the litigious atmosphere of a court, I am equally ready to help him. I want to improve our arbitration machinery, and make its work more satisfactory, so that better results may be obtained by cutting out the antagonistic attitude which the parties assume when they approach the court. The spirit we must cultivate is that of trying to bring the parties together as partners in industry who want to talk things over in a friendly way among themselves. We want to frame our legislation on those lines, but I cannot get out of my mind the conviction that the very method which the Minister is seeking to employ, that of endowing the conciliation commissioners with arbitral powers and giving them a final decision, making them judges, rather than negotiators, will not improve matters. I admit that a hint from a court is often useful in bringing the parties together. Very often if a judge indicates what is running through his mind it may lead to some kind of conciliation between the parties. A nod from the Bench has often led to a settle- ment of litigation. But here we are giving a conciliation commissioner arbitral power, and in doing so, it seems to me, that we are destroying the very spirit we want to create. The Government says that it has been given a mandate to employ more conciliation and have less arbitration; to get rid of the atmosphere of the court, while keeping it in the background as a court of final appeal, and to bring the parties together at a round table with a conciliation commissioner. It is the way to do the job satisfactorily. Hitherto we have not made use of conciliation commissioners to any great extent. The Registrar has been the sole conciliation commissioner. One Registrar, a man of strong personality, has done a lot of useful conciliatory work. I venture to suggest that the best part of the work that has been done by arbitration has been that which has been done in this way by conferences, conciliation and agreement resulting in the filing of agreements in the court. If no agreement could be reached, of course the matter had finally to go to the court. </para>

From what I understand there are in South Australia industrial boards with independent chairmen. I do not know whether the  chairman  of a board is required to have particular qualifications or whether it is within the competence of the Government to appoint any person. </para>

            <para>- I have been told that what I have said is the case, butit is merely hearsay, and if the Minister asks me for a demonstration of the proof of it, I am unable at this moment to supply it. I submit it merely for what it is worth, but I shall endeavour to get some evidence on the point to give to the Senate. It is said that if unlimited power of appeal is given, there will be an appeal in all cases, and that it will merely mean a duplicating of machinery; that there will be all the trouble of getting a hearing before the conciliation commissioner and then the further trouble of going over the whole ground again before he Arbitration Court. I venture to suggest, however, that the effect of giving an unlimited power of appeal, or of extending the right of appeal in the manner suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> would be to make more effective the work of the conciliation commissioners and conciliation committees. The fact that any determination might be appealed against would make the commissioners or committees more careful and more efficient; it would make them see that their determinations were sound in every detail. I think, therefore, it would be conducive to efficiency, that is, of course, if the Senate yields to the solicitations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and endows the conciliation commissioners with arbitral powers. If this compromise is to be arranged; if the matter is to be adjusted on those lines, and we draw upon the South Australian experience, then I say we should adopt in full the South Australian practice, and not restrict the right of appeal. We should then have an inferior tribunal and a higher tribunal, to which there is the right of appeal if there is dissatisfaction at the decision of the lower tribunal. I should like to point out what that will involve. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson</inline> has argued from the view-point of the lawyer. The Government believes that it is a step in the right direction to clothe conciliation commissioners with arbitral powers, and that by doing so a difficulty will be solved which the Arbitration Court has not been able to solve during the last twelve or eighteen months. Most honorable senators will agree that the present arbitration judges, in the exercise of their jurisdiction, have been responsible for many disputes, and much bitterness and antagonism between employers and employees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson</inline> referred to the timber-workers&#39; dispute. Surely no one was surprised that trouble occurred in that industry following the award which represented a reduction of18s. a week in wages to certain employees and a reversion to48 hours. </para>

            <para>- But that matter did not affect the general position. As might have been expected, the timber-workers went on strike, and the whole of the work in that important industry was dislocated . I spoke on the hustings in support of the action taken by the employees. I am as convinced to-day as I was then, that their action was fully justified. With all respect to the Arbitration Court judges, I suggest that if in the administration of his high office the judge who made the award in the timber industry had shown a more conciliatory spirit towards the timber-workers all concerned would have been satisfied, and we should not have had that protracted industrial struggle resulting in such great economic waste. The railway and tramway employees in New South Wales have also good reason to be dissatisfied. The award relating to the tramway section had expired, and, although the union was knocking at the door of the Arbitration Court for twelve months, it was unable to get a hearing. It is significant that shortly after the political appointment by the Bavin Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary,</inline> as the new railways commissioner, a plaint was filed before the Arbitration Court, which awarded reduced wages and increased working hours. Nothing was said during the hearing about increased motor transport as one of the factors responsible for decreased earnings on the railway and tramway services. These economic facts were entirely overlooked. Because pf that award, the whole of the service is to-day seething with discontent. </para>

        <para>The first legislation relating to arbitration and conciliation was introduced by the Ballance Government in New Zealand. It was amended and improved by the Seddon Government, and later the See Government of New South &#34;Wales introduced legislation on somewhat similar lines. Unfortunately our arbitration system has become the cockpit of political strife, and not infrequently appointments to the judiciary are governed by political considerations. This is the crux of all our industrial troubles. In New South Wales, the Lang Government appointed a number of conciliation boards and commissioners, and the whole system worked peacefully and satisfactorily for some years. I venture to say without fear of successful contradiction that the system evolved by the Lang Ministry did more to prevent industrial upheavals in that State than any legislation that has been passed by either the State or Federal Parliaments. </para>

          <para>This article is confined, as I stated in the beginning, to the Federal Court of Conciliation, and to my own actual experience in connexion therewith. But American readers should know that in each of the six Australian States there is some wages board system under the State law or some Industrial or Arbitration Court- Victoria was the first State to adopt a system of wages boards, about 1896; and her example has been more or less followed in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Western Australia has an Arbitration Court, and New South Wales has a combination of the two systems, wages boards and an Industrial Court. There is no organic connexion between the State system and the Federal system. The object of the wages boards is primarily to prevent sweating or underpayment; the object of the federal court is to preserve or restore industrial peace. </para>

        <para>We believe that conciliation boards, vested with arbitral powers, will do much to break down the prejudice that exists with regard to our present arbitration system.

          <para>The truth is, I think, that if the men secure the essentials of food, shelter, clothing, &#38;c, they are not so unreasonable as is sometimes supposed. They do not love strikes for the sake of strikes, and the great majority are generally quite willing to submit to reason if they feel that they are reasonably treated. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That expresses the thought of the great mass of the workers. They do not love strikes, and they do not strike without good cause. If conciliation had been adopted in the timber-workers &#39; dispute, there is good reason to believe that that disastrous strike would not have occurred, and the timber-workers and their wives and families would have been saved a great deal of distress and torment. It is all very well for some honorable senators opposite to laugh and jeer at any reference to the sufferings of the timberworkers and their dependants during that long struggle. I speak strongly on this matter, because I feel keenly the position in which those workers were placed at the time, and I have a fairly intimate knowledge of the sufferings endured by many employed in that industry. </para>

          <para>. - The debate on the proposed new section and the amendments moved by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should, I think, clarify the position, and indicate the viewpoints of honorable senators on both sides. The measure has, up to the present, suffered many vicissitudes. It has been severely mangled in committee, but we have now reached the stage at which we must decide whether its vital principles shall be accepted in such a form as to prove workable and satisfactory, or whether their effect shall be nullified by provisos and impediments which will prevent the act from functioning effectively. They disclose the real opinion of honorable senators opposite on the subject of conciliation. Their attitude was clearly demonstrated by the Leader  of  the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> when he said that they do not see any necessity to appoint conciliation commissioners.  Of  course they do not. They do not believe in arbitration, and if they did they would say, as they did not very long ago, that there is no necessity for a federal arbitration system. Itis not very long ago that honorable senators opposite said - and although they are not prepared to say it now, they still believe it - that had they the power they would abolish the federal arbitration system tomorrow. To that extent they are consistent; but they ought to recognize the will of the people of this country. The Labour party did not make federal conciliation and arbitration an issue at the last general election. Honorable senators opposite and their colleagues in another place did, and the people gave a verdict. The result is that the present Government occupies the treasury benches, and with an undoubted mandate from the people to improve the machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes. For many years the Labour party has been firmly convinced that conciliation is the most effective means of settling industrial disputes. Therefore, prominence has been given in this measure to conciliation. </para>

If conciliation is to succeed it will be because the person who occupies the position of an umpire, and decides between the two sections, has some power to insist that the views that he puts before them shall be respected. </para>

            <para>- It does not matter by what name he is known. Even admitting that he is an arbitrator, is not a decision of an arbitrator likely to be more acceptable than a decision of a judge of the Arbitration Court,in which the Leader of the Opposition professes to believe? The representatives of the employers and employees can meet in conference, and the balance of the power be held by a conciliator, who makes his decision or suggestions and answers both parties as to the justification of such decisions. At present such conditions do not exist. Although the parties have their counsel or representatives to plead their case before the Arbitration Court, the judge after hearing the evidence retires to the austere silence of his chambers and without the assistance of the parties or their representatives propounds his judgment which has a far-reaching effect on the industrial and communal life of the country. It may be that the Leader of the Opposition is correct and that the conciliation commissioners have arbitral powers. If they have, such powers are more likely to achieve industrial peace, which we believe is possible of achievement, than the efforts of a judge working under conditions such as I have mentioned. We were informed that, if the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition giving the right of appeal was accepted, the appointment of conciliation commissioners would be acceptable to the Opposition. Conciliation will be acceptable to the Opposition only if the commissioners are deprived of every modicum of the power which they should possess. If the amendment is carried, the conciliation commissioners as a means of promoting industrial peace, will cease to operate. Let us examine the division of power between the two parties, which will operate in the interests of industrial peace. If this bill is passed the Arbitration Court will still determine such nation-wide questions as the basic wage and the standard hours of industry; conciliation commissioners or committees will then determine the marginal differences for skill and other conditions of employment in order to ensure peace in industry. Their powers are strictly limited because the great question of arbitration standards are beyond their jurisdiction. The commissioners having dealt with the matters that come within their purview, to the satisfaction of both parties, the court extends the right of appeal. The Leader of the Opposition wants more thancorrectional appeal. He wishes the right of appeal to be given in any question substantially prejudicial to the interests of the employers or employees in any industry. If we&#39; are to accept that principle we might as well abolish conciliation commissioners. The Leader of the Opposition wishes to make an absolute certainty that at an appeal will be made against every decision of the conciliation committee. The amendment reads -  &#34; After section thirty-one  a  of the principal act the following section is inserted: -  3  Lab.  ( 1 ) An award or order of a conciliation commissioner or a conciliation committee shall, unless an appeal against any provision of the award or order has been made, have effect upon the expiration of the time within which such appeal may be made. </para>

          <para>.- I have followed with a good deal of interest the debate on this subject. We have been informed that the proposal is to have conciliation committees consisting of employers and employees with an independent chairman. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court can deal only with industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State. I have been cited before a court as the representative of a company and in that citation about 3,000 different companies were concerned. Who, therefore, would appoint the employers&#39; representatives to meet the various companies round a conference table, and who would appoint the employees&#39; representative? Obviously we come back to the present position. The representatives of the unions involved would be the representative employees, and selected employers would represent the companies. Instead of a round-table conference between the parties involved, there is a dispute that has to be determined by a conciliation commissioner acting as a judge. It is not conciliation at all. In fact, conciliation is impossible with such an unwieldy number. If we want true conciliation, we must have something similar to the industrial law of Germany, where they have committees in practically all the works. Should a dispute arise in a factory in Germany, a conference is called. At one side of the table sit the representatives of the employees, and on the other side of the table the representatives of the employers. There is an independent chairman. As all those at the conference know the conditions obtaining in the  i  industry  there is some chance of an agreement being arrived at. But under the conciliation arrangements proposed in this bill it is not possible for the representatives of the employers and the employees to deal effectively with a dispute in which 3,000 companies are involved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> said that the conciliation commissioners would not be authorized to deal with wages and hours of labour. </para>

          <para>- After the basic wage has been fixed, margins are to be agreed upon for skill. If any satisfactory arrangement is to bo arrived at, the parties to the conference must know the conditions obtaining in the industry. Otherwise it is utterly impossible to arrive at a satisfactory settlement. We, therefore, get back to the position that the conciliation commissioner must act as a judge. The representatives of the employers and of the employees can only put their case 10 the commissioner by calling evidence as to the conditions actually obtaining in the industry. That gets us back to where we are to-day. At one time the difficulty was to determine when a dispute existed. That matter was decided by a judge of the High Court, who held that a dispute existed if a plaint had been served. Later there was a provision for the holding of compulsory conferences. I have attended compulsory conferences - r he most futile gatherings I have ever attended in my life. As soon as the judge retired, the representatives just filled in time. They could do no other, for they had no common basis on which to arrive at an agreement. The conferonce always ended by the matter being ref erred back to the judge. No other arrangement was possible. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am glad that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> said that if honorable senators liked they could call the conciliation commissioners arbitrators, because, after all, they will be arbitrators. There can be no jurisdiction unless a dispute assumes an interstate character. I shall give the Senate one example. A big company in New South Wales wanted to approach the Federal </para>
        <para class="block">Arbitration Court, but could not do so, because an interstate dispute did not exist. It, therefore, sought the assistsance of a small company in Tasmania. That made an interstate dispute and the case was taken to the Arbitration Court. The Tasmanian company really had nothing to do with the plaint at all; it was not interested. But it became a party to the dispute to enable the case to reach the Federal Arbitration Court. That kind of thing will continue so long as a dispute must extend beyond the boundaries of one State before the Arbitration Court can deal with it. Unless we give the conciliation commissioners authority to delegate their powers to some persons in a particular district, company, or industry in which the dispute occurs, conciliation must fail. It is impossible in such circumstances for a commissioner to be other than an arbitrator. I shall not say more, excepting that, if we are to make the conciliation commissioners judges, there must be an effective right of appeal. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not want the right of appeal to be made too easy. Once a decision has been given, I want the parties to the dispute to know where they stand. The absence of certainty in that connexion has caused much dissatisfaction in industry in the past. I hope that whatever scheme is introduced will provide for some permanency in this direction. If not, confusion will be worse confounded. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HAL</inline>COLEBATCH (Western Australia) &#91;6.5&#93;. - I dissociate myself completely and entirely from the statement of the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that if certain amendments are made to the amendment by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> members on this side will be satisfied. I certainly shall not be satisfied, for in no circumstances  am I prepared to allow arbitral powers to be vested in conciliation commissioners. I tell honorable senators that if they pass this measure in its present form, they will destroy the confidence of investors, break down industry, and increase rapidly the numbers of the unemployed. In dealing with this measure I am not concerned with either employers or employees. I am not an employer, and have no connexion with employers. I ask honorable senators to consider how we have drifted. We are now considering to what extent we should allow appeals from the decisions of conciliation commissioners. But we have not yet decided whether we shall give the commissioners any arbitrary powers. That point has been evaded. During the second-reading debate, practically every member on this side of the Senate said that he was opposed to arbitral powers being given to the conciliation commissioners. What has happened since then to change their views? What has occurred to justify the Leader of the Opposition in saying that members on this side are now content to vest arbitral powers in the conciliation commissioners so long as certain rights of appeal are allowed? </para>

T said just now, by way of interjection, hat the Federal Arbitration Court had created more disputes than it had settled. I stand by that statement. The Arbitration Court has&#39; been the most disruptive element in the life of this community with which Australia has ever been cursed. There has been nothing but the deepest resentment at its findings, and the most bitter hostility to the system under which it works owing to the flagrant injustices which it has perpetrated on the workers. </para>

            <para>- Before the dinner adjournment I was speaking upon the amendments with which honorable senators opposite are trying to load the bill. On the one hand we have the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate stating that if a certain amendment is granted he will be quite satisfied. On the other <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colebatch</inline> states that he would not be satisfied if that amendment were carried, but would require further amendments which would have the effect of taking the arbitral powers out of the hands of the proposed conciliation commissioners, and would reduce them almost to nonentities. So that I think that I am justified in saying that between one and another honorable senators opposite desire to destroy the bill. It would have been much more satisfactory had they knocked the measure out at the second reading. It appears to me that the bill will be of little use to the majority of the workers in the way in which it has been mutilated. If it is intended to use the majority possessed by the Opposition to mutilate the measure further I for one should be pleased to see it consigned to the scrap-heap rather than have any more deformities imposed upon its already inequitable structure. </para>

Every effort of the Government to. remedy the position is being nullified by the chaotic condition into which its machinery is manoeuvred. If any further mutilations occur to. .this measure I shall wipe my hands of it and wish the Opposition joy of their effort. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson,</inline> in the very thoughtful contribution that he made to the debate, indicated that the right of appeal is provided both in the State law of Victoria and that of South Australia. I believe that some honorable senators are under the impression that the industrial arbitration law of New South Wales provides for a right of appeal similar to that which the Minister is willing to concede in respect of the decisions of these committees or commissioners. But in the amending act of 1926, during which year a government having Labour principles was in power, the full right of appeal is provided. Up to that time the  chairman  or commissioner had arbitral power to decide some things, but since then he has been relegated to the position of merely bringing the parties together. The 1926 amendment provides for an appeal - </para>

        <para class="block">So that under no State system of arbitration have we this arbitral power vested in commissioners or chairmen without some rights of appeal being provided for the parties concerned in the dispute. I appeal to the logic and sense of reasoning of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that in any matters of dispute between individuals, where there are litigants on each side, we have in our own system, and in most of the State systems, a provision for appeal. I believe that it is in respect of an amount exceeding &#163;30 in civil jurisdiction, and the right of appeal is also provided in respect of the decisions of courts of summary jurisdiction. Here, where the employees on the one hand may be deprived in the mass of thousands of pounds, because it is collective bargaining and settlement of disputes, or the employers on the other hand may be mulcted in thousands of pounds, we are leaving the matter to the decision of a  chairman.  Having regard to the magnitude of the interests involved we at least should preserve the full right of appeal. I do not urge that there should be. the right of appeal over every tin-pot thing that comes along. I believe that the amendment of the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition has that in contemplation. We should be doing wrong if we allowed a matter such as this to go without some redress to either side. I venture to suggest that we should simply be ruining the act if the right of appeal were not given. I subscribe to what has been said regarding the conflict between arbitral and conciliation powers. Judging by the speeches that have been made, I fancy that legislation of this character, where you have the conciliation powers passing along until they become arbitral powers, will eventually bring that reaction to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has referred. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact when the decision goes either one way or the other. As I indicated in my second-reading speech, a good deal of the failure of our arbitration system is due to the fact that one side or the other has absolutely lost confidence in some occupant of the office of arbitrator for the time being. </para>

I think that the men charged with office in our Arbitration Court have functioned to the best of their ability and judicial power. Whenever gentlemen in this judicial or quasijudicial office make an award that is disagreeable to one side or the other their value as conciliators has gone. A thing that struck me more than another during my experience of our arbitration system was that one conciliation commissioner had been particularly successful - because he had no arbitral power, and could not inflict any award upon industry. </para>

            <para>- I shall be glad to hear the construction that the Minister puts upon the amendment. So far as I can see the only thing with which we and the court of appeal will be concerned is a matter affecting the public interest. Something may be awarded contrary to the public interest, as happened in one celebrated case about which we have heard a good deal. The parties came together, put it over the arbitrator and secured an award that was absolutely without regard for the public interest. Both parties exacted toll from the consumers and the community generally. Wages went up and the price of the commodity increased, so that both sides to that bargain, an unhappy one from the public point of view, obtained benefits under the award. Surely if the employees in an industry felt that they were aggrieved by the narrow limits or the too far-reaching effects of an award, we should give them some redress. That would help the court along. I fail to see that the amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would lead to a tremendous amount of litigation. If we are going to have appeals we shall have them, one way or the other. If the parties concerned come to an agreement, that is an end to it. But if they do not, and the conciliation commissioner - quasi-arbitrator - makes an award, then there will be an appeal. Do not the words proposed to be inserted by the Leader of the Opposition - &#34;substantially prejudice the interests of employers or employees in the industry&#34; - connote that appeals in regard to t,in-pot things in awards are not to be encouraged, but that it must be a matter substantially prejudicing the interests of employers or employees that the court is called, upon to decide in each case that comes before it? With the precedent of the States to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawson</inline> has referred so ably, the further precedent I have given and the precedents of New Zealand before us, we cannot do better than follow down the well-trodden line of giving a right of appeal, not limited as in the case of some of the States, or as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has proposed, but unlimited  a3  in South Australia. Once the conciliation commissioner throws off the toga of a conciliator and dons the toga of an arbitrator, he loses the confidence of the parties. He is dealing with issues in which thousands and thousands of pounds are at stake. One  deputy  commissioner told me that he was simply overwhelmed when he thought of the great interests and the amount of money likely to be affected by any determination by him one way or another, although there was but a slight difference between the parties. I forget whether it was 6d. or 9d., but it affected the displacement from one side to the other of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. Surely honorable senators must have in mind the importance of the office they are creating. It is no light matter to create these conciliation committees, and I think some relief at least should be given to both parties to a dispute. It is not something to which the employers alone are entitled. It is something to which both sides are entitled, and I shall certainly support the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

            <para>- Yes. In regard to wages and hours there would be an absolute appeal, but there would be only a qualified appeal in regard to the conditions of employment outside wages or hours. There is, therefore, really not much in the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce. Senator McLachlau</inline> was misled by the form in which my proposal was originally submitted. I may say at once that it is the intention of the Government to give an absolute right of appeal on matters affecting wages or hours, and that the words &#34; which in the opinion of the court is likely to affect the public interest&#34; should qualify conditions of employment only. There is certainly an unqualified right of appeal under the wages board system, but a wages board has an unrestricted right to deal with wages or hours, whereas under this bill the conciliation committees will not have that right. On matters of wages and hours there will be an absolute right of appeal, and on any other matter the right of appeal will be limited to any condition of employment which, in the opinion of the court, is likely to affect the public interest. </para>

            <para>- No. It might pay some employers to close on all the holidays fixed by the award. It must be borne in mind that in arbitration we have to get away from what affects the interests of a particular employer or employee. The system sets up collective bargaining. Some people seem to imagine that industrial courts have been created solely because of a desire to have bodies which can fix rates of wages. As a matter of fact, our industrial courts have been set up, not to fix wages or conditions, <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> wages or <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> conditions, but as a means to an end; that is, industrial peace. As to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> that once a conciliation commissioner assumes arbitral powers he loses the confidence of both parties, I may point out that since 1907 wages boards have been in operation in South Australia, and there are men now acting as chairmen of those boards who were on the first boards appointed. </para>

            <para>- That is not so in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clouston, Mr. Merry,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> Lyons. The last-named is not a solicitor, he has had legal experience, I admit; but the point is that these men have given decisions, some favorable to employers, and some favorable to employees, and what the average employer or employee wants is a  chairman  who is prepared to give both sides a just deal. The average employer or employee is prepared to play cricket, but he wants the rules of cricket observed, and if confidence has been lost in the arbitration system it is because a union, rightly or wrongly, has very often felt that the wicket has been flooded before it has gone in to bat. That is an impression we have to remove, and it will not be removed so long as we have judges who simply say, &#34;I have a most distasteful task to perform.&#34; They will not  argue with the parties as to the nature of the distastefulness. If a man sitting at a table made a statement like that another could have an argument with him, and might possibly convince him or be convinced by him. Although some honorable senators may think that the words suggested to be inserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> have practically the same meaning as the words suggested by the Government, they have not. They seek to import into the arbitration system a principle which every judge has attempted to avoid. The judge tries to consider a case from the point of view of how an award may affect industry generally, and not any particular industry. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment were agreed to it would be taken as an instruction to the judges that the right of appeal is to lie in regard to some such pettyfogging matter as the need for first-aid appliances in the clothing trade, which might have a prejudicial effect upon the employer. The amendment I suggest does not impose any hardship on the employer, and is consistent with our system of arbitration. I ask honorable senators, therefore, to accept it in the amended form which I have already indicated. </para>

I should, however, like some information from the Leader of the Senate as to the meaning of the words, &#34; not in the public interest.&#34; In some occupations the conditions of employment are almost as important as are the wages and hours. They may have a vital effect upon its efficiency. I do not know if piece-work would come within the definition of hours or wages, or whether it would be regarded as a condition of employment. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.That may be so. Let us consider the conditions of employment in, say, the pastoral industry. A dispute may arise as to whether sheep are too wet to be shorn, and a decision by a commissioner may have an important effect upon the industry. In most awards, I understand, there is a provision to meet this difficulty. If a conciliation commissioner made an award affecting the shearing of wet sheep, any organization which desired to appeal against it would have to show that the award affected the public interest. </para>

On the other hand, if in the view of the pastoralist the decision of the conciliation commissioner was unreasonable, in that it caused undue delay in shearing, involving the pastoralist in loss of time, that also might be regarded as a matter affecting the public interest. I feel sure the Leader of the Senate does not wish the committee to accept those provisions in the dark, and I do not desire to press my amendment if I can be satisfied that the Minister&#39;s proposal meets the situation.

          <para>.   -  I am afraid that the point raised by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> relating to the condition of sheep would not be the subject-matter of appeal. In any case, it would be much simpler for the employers and employees, with the  chairman  at the head of a table, to discuss this matter among themselves and reach  a  decision satisfactory to all concerned. This certainly would be better than arguing the question at issue before the court. Matters affecting the public interest would not relate to internal conditions in a particular industry itself. They would include that class of dispute which, if meddled with by industrial courts, would give rise to anomalies in the industry concerned. The class of case that would be covered by this provision would include for example questions affecting piece-work conditions. If a commissioner decided to restrict the output in an industry he would be laying down  a principle which previously had not been grafted on to the industrial arbitration system. Such a decision as that, if allowed te stand, might injure the whole structure. But it would immediately form the subject-matter of an appeal and the court would apply the necessary corrective. Conditions peculiar to a particular industry will have to be decided by these industrial commissioners. Unless there is an obvious abuse of power by the commissioner there will be no right of appeal. The Government is anxious ito limit the right of appeal to questions which, if not made the subject-matter of appeal^ might conceivably work a serious injustice, not only to the particular industry concerned, but to industry generally, thereby endangering the whole structure of arbitration. Preference to unionists is another example of a highly contentious question. This would form the subject-matter of appeal on the ground that it affected the public interest, because preference granted in one industry might lead to a demand for an extension of the principle to some other industry. </para>

          <para>. - Obviously, the intention is to protect the public interest when an agreement is arrived at between employers and employees in any particular industry. It is necessary that the public should he considered. But what I am concerned about is the omission of any provision in this clause or, for that matter, any other clause in the bill, for the public to be heard in the making of awards which may be prejudicial to the public interest. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of that. Unfortunately, an AttorneyGeneral, representing as he does the Government in office, is too often prone to lose sight of the public interest. I think I can furnish a much better illustration than that cited by the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> who. mentioned the shearing of wet sheep as a matter likely to affect the public interest. I remember some years ago a long drawn-out dispute in New South Wales over the question of day versus night baking of bread. I do not know if the dispute has been definitely settled yet. On that occasion an agreement was reached between the employers and employees to do away with night baking, and I know that certain sections of the public felt distinctly grieved because they were obliged to eat stale instead of fresh bread. This objection applied particularly to week-end baking. If at the time there had been in the law some provision such as is now proposed to include in this bill, possibly some person or organization would have intervened in the public interest. When the public interest is vitally concerned, some one should have the right to intervene on behalf of the general community. Employers and employees have come before an industrial tribunal and reached decisions as to the conditions to be observed in industry. The employers have not been perturbed if an increase in wages or a reduction in hours has been awarded, because the additional cost has been passed on to the public. Instances have arisen in which the public interest was vitally concerned; but no provision existed at that time, neither can I see that there is in this instance, for a representative of the public to intervene. If we are to consider the public interest, there ought to be some provision in the bill for the intervention of an authority representing the public to place the viewpoint of the people before the court. </para>

I am surprised to learn from the Minister that the Commonwealth has not the constitutional power to insert in this bill a provision permitting the public, through an organization representing the public, to appeal to the court against an award vitally affecting the public interest. Unless that is done I cannot see that the public interest is likely to be safeguarded as it should be when an award is being made. </para>

            <para>- An appeal would be made by either party having a grievance. There are many awards which are not in any way detrimental to the public interest. For many years I have been associated with industrial arbitration. At one time we strongly objected to the right of appeal against awards of the court. It was felt that those who had the money could appeal from one court to another, and that there would be great difficulty in reaching a final decision. But for some years now I have been strongly convinced that there should be an opportunity to appeal from a decision of the Arbitration Court, because judges, like all other human beings, sometimes make mistakes. I can recall one case when no appeal court on earth could have upheld the decision then given. I remember another decision, an appeal from which, had it been possible under such a provision as this, would have been very beneficial to a large section of the community. This new clause gives the power for additional evidence to be tendered if necessary. In a recent case the court refused the right to one party to submit additional evidence. There should. be the right of appeal against decisions of the court, and, if it is left to the full Arbitration Court constituted as it is, it should be in the interests of the parties concerned &#39; and of the public. The right of appeal against an award in an important industry is necessary, particularly if it results in men engaged in an industry closely associated with that concerned being thrown out of work. This provision removes many anomalies which now exist. </para>

          <para>. - I suggest to the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> that the conditions to which he referred would not be covered by the amendment now suggested by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly).</inline> An appeal can be made to the court against any award or order if the wages, hours or conditions of employment are, in the opinion of the court, likely to affect the public interest. But under this provision there is no power to permit any party to submit additional evidence. L suggest that the comprehensive language employed by the Leader of the Opposition, &#34; which, in the opinion of the court, substantially prejudices the interest of employers or employees in the industry&#34;, would meet the class of case mentioned by the Honorary Minister. An award may impose conditions objectionable to employers or employees. Mistakes have been made with respect to some matters quite apart from wages, which vitally affect the parties to an award. The interested parties should have some redress before a higher tribunal. If the Minister amends his amendment we could be able to meet the case mentioned by the Honorary Minister. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;Duncan</inline> that this provision can give the public very little comfort. &#34;When an award is made, the employers consider it only from the viewpoint of their industry, and the employees from the standpoint of wages. I do not know if any machinery can be devised to overcome the difficulty mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> In the Maritime Industries Bill it was left, I think, to a judge in certifying an award to see that it was not prejudicial to the public interest. I suggest that the condition to which the Minister has referred would not be met by a right of appeal in respect of wages and hours, because the conditions of employment which might affect the public interest would not cover cases such as that to which he referred. If a mistake occurs now it remains until rectified; but if there were a right of appeal, the matter could be adjusted almost immediately. I sympathize with the Minister in his desire to avoid appeals on trivial matters. I suggest that we insert the words &#34; which in the opinion of the court &#34;. That would leave the decision to the court, and would not mean that an appeal would be granted in every case. I agree that the parties to a dispute are not &#39;likely to be greatly concerned with the public interest. They are more likely to be concerned only with their own affairs. </para>

        <para class="block">The effect of the amendment would be that the rules of the court would prescribe the time within which an appeal could be made against an award or order. Until that period had elapsed the new award would not take effect. The other proposal that I had intended to make was that the award could not have effect until the appeal had been heard. But the &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council pointed out that that might have the effect of prolonging the hearing of the appeal by the party interested in retaining the award already given. There is some force in his argument, and, therefore, I shall not move in that direction. But I think that it is necessary to provide that within the time fixed by the rule of the court, which would probably be fourteen days, the new award should not have effect. There would be time for an appeal before effect was given to the new award. I understand that in the South Australian law, and also in the Victorian law, awards made by wages boards do not take effect until they are gazetted. This amendment would have the same effect. The rule of the court would fix the time. The award would operate at the expiration of that time. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be prepared to accept my amendment. It appears to me. to be quite reasonable, and would not unduly delay the bringing into effect of the new award. </para>

            <para>- The procedure that operates in the other States is: the case goes into court, an award is made, and fourteen days after it comes into effect. I think it would be a pity to insert this amendment. It is not likely that during the period of this new experiment an award will prejudicially affect industry. I do not know of any application for an increase in wages at the present time. </para>

            <para>- The idea behind the Government&#39;s mind is not to encourage appeals. If we succeed in that we shall do an immense amount of good. During the last twelve months of his occupancy of his office in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President</inline> Hewitson has not been occupied in the court for more than one month. But no one can estimate the value of the man&#39;s service to his country. You cannot judge the value of the Canberra fire brigade by its activity nor can you judge the value of an industrial judge by the number of cases that he takes.Rather must you assess his value by the number of cases that he prevents from coming to the court. If our Arbitration Court judges, instead of being in the hurly burly of present day industrial politics, confined themselves to the setting up of a body of principles for the guidance of these conciliation commis sioners we should find that the very happy system that has for years operated in the city of culture, Adelaide, would also operate in the Commonwealth industrial arena. I am prepared to enter my protest against this amendment. As this is the last clause of the bill, which already bears a number of scars, we can let it go and refer it to the conciliation committee of the two Houses, which will, I feel sure, be set up to review the whole matter. </para>

I do not think the Senate will agree to do so. I doubt if the proposal has any constitutional validity, and I am a little surprised that we do not find in this bill a little friend that crept into the Wheat Marketing Bill, providing that, in the event of the High Court declaring that any portion of the bill was unconstitutional, the rest of the measure should stand. In any case, I do not think it is our business to pass legislation, knowing that it is unconstitutional, simply with the idea that the High Court may not so declare it. </para>

Under this clause they are to be appointed by the Governor-General. I cannot see the wisdom of bringing the executive into the realm of industrial disputes, and I think it desirable in the interests of the executive itself to leave the matter to the Chief Judge as in the principal act. The administration of the Arbitration Act is carried out by the Registrar of the Arbitration Court. All the sub-sections of section 34 in the existing act are preferable to those set out in the proposed new section 34 with the exception of subsection 8 which is a good one. To test the opinion of the committee I move - </para>

          <para>. -  I have given careful consideration to this matter since the secondreading debate, and I think I shall be able to convince the honorable senator that the Government&#39;s proposal is the more desirable. Under this bill we have constituted the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, with other judges, as am appellate tribunal. If there is one thing about a British court of law which we all value, it is the tradition that nothing shall be done to bring it within the realms of suspicion. If the Chief Judge appoints a person to preside over a conference to deal with matters which may subsequently come before him as a member of the appellate tribunal, the appellate court might not be above suspicion. The Government takes the view that it is better to make the appointment by executive act. </para>

The least that honorable senators can do who receive such telegrams is to bring them under the notice of the Senate. I do not intend to delay honorable senators at this hour nor to insult the State which I have the honour to represent by saying that it lags behind other States. There are many people throughout the Commonwealth who are naturally interested in the proposed tax, and who wish to know officially, not only the rate to be imposed, but on what goods it is to be collected. </para>

I have not seen the Prime Minister on the subject recently, but I understand from the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> that the Prime Minister is to make available to-day a statement for publication in the press to-morrow. If any precis has been prepared I shall undertake to supply honorable senators with copies so that they may acquaint their constituents with the exact nature of the tax. </para>
