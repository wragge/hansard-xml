            <para>- As the honorable senator was good enough to inform me that he intended to ask this question, I have had prepared information as up to date as possible. Under the £1,000,000 special grant by the Commonwealth for unemployment relief South Australia was allotted £114,000. The date on which the programme was authorized was the 4th January, 1930, and' the advance asked for was £19,000. Application for this amount was made on the 21st January, 1930, and. the advance was made on the 28th January, 1930. The expenditure to the 28th February, 1930, was £17,000, and the number of men employed was 290. </para>

            <para>- Then I shall ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether he is aware that a statement was made recently by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs that 50,000 new jobs had been made available as a result of the new tariff schedules. This statement appeared in the press, together with a photograph of the Minister. I did not ask whether avenues in which employment already existed  were being explored; but where those 50,000 new positions were to be found, so that I and other honorable senators could inform persons applying for employment where they could get work. </para>

          <para>In placing before honorable senators an outline of the legislative programme which they will be asked to consider in the next few months, it is desirable to dwell for a moment on the difficult financial and economic position confronting the Commonwealth at the present time. Fundamentally, we are suffering from the effects of world-wide depression, accentuated by over-borrowing. Though the value and volume of our  exports have declined, imports have continued to enter the Commonwealth on a large scale. As a consequence, the demands made by importers and others on London funds now exceed the supply, notwithstanding that £17,000,000 in gold has been shipped to London since July last. In addition to payment for imports, we have, of course, to meet a heavy annual interest bill on money borrowed abroad. </para>
          <para>For the six-years period ended 30th June, 1929. imports exceeded exports by £42,000,000. In the same period, we had to pay overseas, for interest and services, £193,000,000. Thus the net total of our oversea obligations was £235,000,000. In the same period, our oversea debt increased by £153,000,000. We also received, in London, during this six-years period, the sum of £9,000,000 in respect of Bawra dividends. This gives a total of £162,000,000 received in London towards meeting overseas payments. As the overseas payments for the six-years period amounted to £235,000,000, as already shown, there was an adverse balance in that period amounting to £73,000,000. Fortunately, at the beginning of the six-years period, Australia had a large accumulation of funds in London. There are, of course, certain invisible imports and exports the effect of which the Commonwealth Statistician is unable to calculate.  The results quoted, however, illustrate the position as far as it is possible to do so. </para>
          <para>The position is somewhat worse if regard is paid to the trade figures for the six month's ended 31st December last. In that period there was an excess of imports over exports, including bullion and specie, of £16,000,000, and payments for interest and services overseas, amounted to about £17,000,000. Thus we required for that six-months period a net total of £33,000,000 to pay for excess imports, interest and services. Against that amount may be set the sum of £10,000,000 borrowed by means of Treasury bills in the oversea market. </para>
          <para>The position demands that we should . take the most stringent measures to rectify the trade balance. Thus, our immediate problem is to bring about a decrease of imports and an increase in the volume of exportable products, for which a demand exists. That is a task to which we must devote the most earnest attention. </para>
          <para>Development of primary industries for the production of exportable wealth and the extension of Australian manufacturing will help to balance our external trade and enable us to employ our people, and eventually to maintain a larger population. It would be a policy of despair to declare that costs of production and development are too high to permit of the expansion of our industries. Such a policy would imply that all development and expansion must cease. We must face the position frankly. Suggestions that wage reductions are essential to bring about increased production cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. Employment is the barometer of prosperity, and production would be much increased if those who are now unemployed could be placed in useful work. </para>
          <para>The Government has devoted much attention to the necessity for stimulating the export of primary products. Important discussions have taken place with representatives of the wool industry, and we are watching with interest the policy now being put into effect, which, it is hoped, will stabilize prices. In the belief that wheat-growing, of all primary industries, is the one that will most readily respond to proposals for expansion, the Government last month invited Ministers of Agriculture of the various States, and representatives of the wheat-growing industry, to a conference at Canberra to discuss plans formulated by the Government for the establishment of a Commonwealth compulsory wheat pool. The principle of a compulsory pool was adopted by that conference. An Australian-wide wheat marketing scheme, controlled by a pool board in each State, elected by the wheat-growers, and by a Commonwealth pool board, on which each State board will be represented, is the essence of the proposals. A ballot of all wheat-growers is to be taken before 31st July next, to authorize the constitution of these boards. The Commonwealth Government has invited the State Governments to join with it in guaranteeing the growers, for the first year, 4s. per bushel, payable at country sidings, which would mean the equivalent of approximately  4s.8d. per bushel f.o.b. Honorable senators will be asked to consider the legislation that is necessary to give authority, so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, to these proposals. Encouragement will be given to the wine industry by increasing the export bounty from1s. to1s. 6d. a gallon. A bill to amend the Wine Bounty Act will be submitted. </para>
          <para>The Government has given the closest attention to the loan position in Australia. In December last, a loan of £10,000,000 was raised in Australia on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States. To this loan the public subscribed £7,790,000, the balance being taken up by the underwriting banks. Last month, a further loan was issued to provide for the conversion and redemption of £10,400,000 of Commonwealth securities maturing in Australia on the 15th March. At the same time, holders of Commonwealth securities maturing on the15th December next were given the right to convert into the new loan. The March conversion and redemption loan has been over-subscribed, and the excess will be used to meet portion of the loan maturing on 15th December. With regard to the December loan of £60,000,000, the conversion of £21,000,000 has already been arranged for and applications are still coming in satisfactorily. These results are gratifying and illustrate Australia's capacity to arrange her own conversion operations locally without recourse to the overseas markets. </para>
          <para>Four meetings of the Australian Loan Council have been held since the Government assumed office. At these meetings, the questions of loans to cover arrears of borrowing and present requirements, as well as questions relating to future borrowing, were discussed. The financial position made it necessary for the Loan Council to consider further reductions in loan expenditure during the present financial year, and to provide for substantial reductions in the programmes of borrowing for the Commonwealth and the States for the coming financial year. During the first six months of the financial year - that is, until 31st December last - customs revenue exceeded the estimate by £1,277,000, but for January, customs revenue was £398,000 below the estimate, and for February, £608,000 below the estimate. As tariff in creases and exchange difficulties must result in diminishing imports, there is every likelihood that customs revenue will continue to fall during the balance of the financial year. </para>
          <para>Expenditure in all departments has been carefully investigated, and reductions have been, and are being, secured by eliminating wasteful payments. </para>
          <para>The whole administration of the Department of Defence is now being reviewed with the object, of effecting economies consistent with efficiency. Proposals for the amalgamation of the Royal Naval College and the Royal Military College in a joint establishment at Jervis Bay are being inquired into. It is felt that a saving in the very high cost of training naval and military officers can be made. Maintenance of the Royal Naval College last year cost £64,750. As there were 52cadets at the college, the cost worked out at nearly £1,250 per head per annum. The staff employed for the maintenance of the college was 147, or nearly three persons for every cadet. Similarly, with regard to the Royal Military College, the maintenance cost was £52,750 for 74 cadets, or more than £700 per head per annum. A staff of 98 persons was employed for the 74 cadets. </para>
          <para>Further economies will be effected by the proposed re-organization of the work of the Development and Migration Commission. A bill to amend the Development and Migration Commission Act will be introduced. Developmental activities will be placed under the control of the Prime Minister's Department, and migration will be controlled by the Department of Markets and Transport. Co-ordination will be achieved between the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and of the development section by means of a consultative committee. This committee will deal with all schemes under the £34,000,000 Agreement, and will advise the Minister before preliminary work is started. It will also deal with matters of development referred to it by the States. The Commonwealth has had to bear the heavy cost of a supervisory organization designed to deal with a substantial stream of assisted migrants. On that heavy overhead charge, and on the contributions of passage money to migrants, a considerable reduction has been made. As a direct result of the  arrangements now operative, it is expected that a saving of  £41,000 <inline font-style="italic">mil</inline> be effected during the current financial year, and that for the year  1930-31,  there will be a direct saving to the people of  £124,000.  Uniformity of control will mean a saving, in the London organization alone, of about  £19,000  per annum. By arrangement with the British Government, assisted migration will be confined for the present to boys and domestics, and to nominations involving the re-union of families. The whole position was discussed fully with the Premiers of the States at the conference at Canberra lust month when is was agreed that in future, all requisitions and nominations should be forwarded direct to the Commonwealth. Hitherto, the practice followed by the States has been lo forward nominations direct to Loudon. The Government considers that as it is called upon to bear a large proportion of the cost, by way of passage money, loans to migrants, and administrative expenses, it should exercise strict supervision and careful reconsideration nf nominations as well as requisitions. </para>
          <para>With regard to non-British migration, steps have been taken to limit newcomers of nationalities already subject to quota restrictions to numbers representing a reduction of approximately  50  per cent, for this year as compared with last year. The permission granted in these cases will be confined, with very few exceptions, to the closest ' relatives of persons already settled in Australia. </para>
          <para>The need for an amendment of the . Constitution designed to give greater legislative power to the Commonwealth Parliament has long been recognised. The dispute in the coalmining industry, and the recent decisions of the High Court, have emphasized the need. One of the earliest measures to be placed before honorable senators will provide for the holding of a referendum, at which proposals for the alteration of the Constitution, along the lines desired, will be submitted to the people, </para>
          <para>Industrial legislation has received the close attention of the Government. Under the enlarged constitutional powers to be sought, we intend to bring down, later in the life of the Parliament, a measure providing for the reconstruction of the laws affecting conciliation and arbitration, together with a comprehensive scheme of social insurance, including unemployment, covering Commonwealth, State, municipal and private employers end their employees. There will also be a complete reorganization of labour bureaux throughout Australia. In the meantime, bills will be introduced this session relating to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Arbitration (Public Service) Act, the Transport Workers Act, and the Crimes Act. Among other matters 'to be submitted for approval will be measures relating to the Seat of Government, Com- ' monwealth Bank, Commonwealth Public Service, superannuation, Commonwealth employees' compensation, a cotton bounty, a shale oil bounty, the Federal Aid Roads Agreement and wireless telegraphy. There will also be bills amending the Navigation Act, the Copyright Act, the Patents Act, the Income Tax Bates and Assessment Acts, the Land Tax Assessment Act, find honorable senators will be asked to consider an amendment to the Industries Preservation Act to permit of contracts being entered into with regard to shipping freights. It will also be necessary to con-  aider the tariff schedules, tabled towards the close of last year. There is no doubt that the action of the Government in tabling tariff schedules embracing more than  300  items arrested to  8  considerable degree the growth of unemployment. After the tariff was introduced, numerous notices of dismissal were withdrawn, and the increased protection provided has given substantial additional employment. </para>
          <para>Honorable members will be asked to agree to resolutions for the ratification of the declaration by the Commonwealth accepting 'the optional clauses of the statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and of the protocols recently adopted in connexion with the revision of the statute of the court and the accession of the United States of America thereto. There will also be opportunities for discussion of the report of the conference on the operation of dominion legislation and merchant shipping legislation, and of the report of the Australian delegation to the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations. </para>
          <para>The difficulties confronting Australia are serious, and a proper realization of them should result in wholehearted  co-operation  of all sections in the working out of a satisfactory solution. Indeed, at the present juncture, the Parliament might fittingly become an economic conference of representatives of the people meeting to discuss the general position. </para>
