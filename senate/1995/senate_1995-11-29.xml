<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that people receive equal treatment in areas governed by Commonwealth law and are protected against discrimination on the grounds of their sexuality or their transgender identity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purpose of the bill sexuality is defined as heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill seeks to provide long overdue protection against discrimination for people going through a gender reassignment process or identifying as transsexuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My motivation for this bill is the firm, indeed passionate, belief that a civilised, cohesive and humane society must live by the basic tenet of justice for all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To deny equal treatment to a human being because she or he is of a different gender, race, colour or nationality is fast becoming unacceptable in our community, and a measure of our progress in building the core values by which we want to live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same principle applies to sexuality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On his recent visit to Australia, Reverend Jim Wallis said at a meeting of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship that we should treat the issue of discrimination against gay and lesbian people as an issue of civil liberties rather than as a matter for theological debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context it is worth noting the 1986 statement "The Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons" by the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to remove discrimination in areas of Commonwealth law including employment, education, superannuation, industrial relations, the provision of goods and services, sporting activities, clubs and associations. It also contains protection against vilification and the incitement of hatred on the basis of a person's sexuality or transgender identity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that any effort to bring about positive social change must take account of the need to respect deeply held religious beliefs, of the need for a person's own `private space' and, if they want to change their attitudes, the possibility to do so at their own pace in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the bill provides exemptions for churches, religious teaching institutions and church schools for teachers and persons seeking, and studying for, ordination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption applies if the institution is acting in good faith to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion and if it is acting in accordance with the tenets, beliefs or teachings of the particular religion or creed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of producing what turned out to be an extremely complex piece of legislation was lengthy. The decision to take on the project was announced during the debate on the Sexual Conduct Bill late in 1994. It was triggered by the narrow ambit of that legislation, limited as it was to the right to privacy under the ICCPR and the missed opportunity it represents in its failure to deal with discrimination in a comprehensive way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia anti-discrimination provisions of varying quality have been enacted in NSW, Queensland, South Australia, the ACT, the Northern Territory and particularly inadequately, in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns federal Attorney General, Mr Lavarch, is reported to have about the constitutional validity of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation on the grounds of sexuality do not appear to be well founded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The external affairs power in s.51 XXIX of the Constitution brings into play the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and ILO Convention III. The ICCPR prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its `view' on the Toonen case, the UN Human Rights Committee said that "the reference to `sex' in articles 2 and 26 is to be taken as including sexual orientation". The High Court is likely to accept that interpretation, particularly since it is open to the Court to base it also on "other status".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to construct the bill's constitutional underpinning in this way points to the urgent need for a comprehensive constitutional Bill of Rights, but that is a topic for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is to be hoped that the ALP Government will find the courage to support this long overdue bill to deal with Commonwealth areas of responsibility and that the Coalition Parties can overcome that small but strident homophobic opposition in their midst, as they largely did in the vote for the Sexual Conduct Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the apparent concern of both the Opposition and the Government that they would risk losing votes if they moved to achieve legal equality for people with a sexuality outside the mainstream is misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social philosopher, John Rawls, suggested that the level of civilisation reached by a community can be judged best by how it treats minorities. On that basis I am confident that Australians are essentially fair-minded people and that they will agree that it is only fair and just that people of a `different' sexuality are protected against discrimination in employment, in education, in the provision of goods and services, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To forestall some of the hysterical misrepresentations that will undoubtedly flood the airwaves, let me emphasise that the bill does not <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">promote</EMPHASIS> homosexuality, does not give any support to paedophiles, does not attack the institution of marriage, but simply equalises the legal position of same sex couples with defacto heterosexual couples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not proposed to give homosexual, bisexual and transgender people any rights or advantages that no one else has. Rather it is proposed to ensure as far as possible to put a stop to the particular disadvantages suffered by homosexual, bisexual and transgender people. In many cases it is not an exaggeration to call it persecution&mdash;persecution of a minority which should not be tolerated in a democratic, liberal and pluralist society, a society which prides itself on the safeguards it claims to provide for individual rights and liberties, the sort of society that Eva Cox in this year's Boyer lectures calls the `civil society'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is different. In a survey undertaken in 1994 by the Melbourne group, Gay Men and Lesbians Against Discrimination (GLAD), 1000 gay and lesbian people were interviewed. In the Report `Not a Day Goes By', 45 per cent of lesbians and gay men reported some form of harassment or discrimination in employment, including loss of jobs. 41 per cent of lesbians and 25 per cent of gay men reported inadequate services or refusal of service, 22 per cent of lesbians and 33 per cent of gay men had experienced inappropriate responses from police including harassment and actual violence in some cases. 70 per cent of lesbians and 69 per cent of gay men reported being verbally abused, threatened or bashed in a public place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not a pretty picture and one that other reports and anecdotal evidence indicates is replicated throughout the country. It is not a situation we should continue to tolerate while we avert our eyes and shrug our shoulders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of essential equality before the law has led me to include heterosexual people in the definition of sexuality and as a result they too will be beneficiaries of the protection against discrimination the bill offers. A `special measures' provision will enable members of any particular sexuality to obtain exclusive access to services and facilities where this is needed to achieve equal opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same sex couple provision will provide the legal basis for specific amendments to other Commonwealth legislation on Immigration, Superannuation, Social Security, Evidence, Health Insurance, Family Law, etc. to the extent that the amendments in this bill do not adequately remove the effect of discriminatory provisions contained in other Commonwealth Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition of discrimination in the payment of superannuation benefits (cl.10) and the same sex couples provision will enable surviving partners to collect superannuation payouts in situations similar to the 1995 Greg Brown case where payment was refused because the partners were of the same sex.. In the establishment of superannuation and life insurance policies companies will be able to discriminate only on the basis of relevant actuarial data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The blanket provision to equalise the legal position of heterosexual defacto and same sex couples will result in some criticism from the gay community, partly on the basis that the `defacto' legal construct does not reflect adequately the nature and quality of same sex couple relationships, notably because the notion of dependency is not as prevalent as in heterosexual relationships. However, this distinction is not as validly drawn as it once may have been in view of the growing sense of equality and desire to share between partners of opposite gender.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must also be recognised that the provision does not attempt to define all same sex relationships but merely provides a legal basis for those same sex couples who are in a `genuine domestic relationship' and want to be treated as such.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point made often during the consultations was the obvious one of the reduction in Social Security and Unemployment payments as a result of a `couple' classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one level the natural response is "you have to take the bad with the good". At another it should lead us to reexamine a policy which penalises Australian couples and families for coming together in one household. Although brought to light by the `same sex couples' debate, the issue is one of general interest and of considerable importance for the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a country where politicians of all hues expound the value of the family as an essential building block of a stable society, we should stop penalising people when they form such family units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would clearly make much more sense to pay benefits to everyone at the individual rate and thus to provide an incentive for family formation. In other words, the adage "Two can live as cheaply as one" should be used to build a more cohesive society rather than serve as a means to reduce the level of Social Security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high cost (approximately $7bn) of such a change is due in part to the fact that unemployment benefits would be payable to non-working spouses of above average income earners. However, this merely accelerates the development of the policy to provide support for home carers. By removing the financial disadvantage of family formation, it is likely that more people would form caring and sharing partnerships, including those not dependent on a sexual relationship, thus providing a more supportive community and corresponding savings in remedial social services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognition is long overdue that lesbians, gay men, bisexual and transgender people are sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunties and sometimes parents. They are members of families and deserve to be treated as such and not as outcasts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To return to the process: following the decision late in 1994 to proceed with the bill, I visited every State capital as well as Darwin and Alice Springs for consultations with representatives of relevant groups and organisations. An Issues Paper arising out of these meetings was released in February 1995 at Melbourne's Midsumma Festival, and circulated throughout Australia, eliciting numerous responses and comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first draft of the bill was completed on 6th of June to be followed by further, revised editions on 24 October, 13 November, 22 November, 24 November. I record with great appreciation the patience, understanding and high professional competence Mr Peter O'Keefe, Assistant Clerk of the Senate and Mr Geoff Harders, Consultant Parliamentary Counsel, brought to this enterprise, together with the comment and advice contributed by several people at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the more distasteful episodes was a series of attacks mounted by a small section of the gay press who appeared determined to put the party political objective of denigrating the Democrats above the interests of the gay community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the other end of the spectrum the publication of the Issues Paper sparked off a sleazy campaign and vicious dirt. Some of these have been submitted for legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr John McNicol, reportedly with former associations to the far right Logos Foundation and now of the so-called `Christian' Alliance, was a little more careful: he merely threatened to mount a well financed political pressure campaign similar to those used by his American sister organisation to silence or unseat politicians daring to support gay law reform. Not surprisingly I am occupying a place of honour in his list of targets, but the Attorney General, Mr Lavarch, and Mr Downer get a mention, too, mainly because of their role in getting the 1994 Sexual Conduct Bill through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I deny Mr McNicol's claim to the term `Christian'&mdash;his views and methods bear no resemblance to the teachings of Christ, who preached tolerance, sought justice and championed the cause of the disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I record with some relief and gratitude the expressions of encouragement and support I have received from many leaders, office bearers and members of Australia's mainstream churches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Sexuality Discrimination Bill to the Senate and to the Australian community as a bill which goes to the very question of who we are and what kind of a society we want to be.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Wool International Act 1993; the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993; the Farm Household Support Act 1992; the Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992; the Agricultural and Chemicals Code Act 1994; and the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill further repeals the following inoperative acts:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wheat Tax (Permit) Act 1984</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wheat Tax (Permit) Collection Act 1984</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will ensure that the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) is required to comply with the policy directions of the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. This is in accordance with the principle of the Commonwealth, state, and territory governments being equal partners in setting the policy direction of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of the other proposed amendments are collectively concerned with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's management of chemicals subject to import and export restrictions under international obligations such as the prior informed consent procedures. The obtaining of information about chemical products from the NRA is a factor in that management. The proposed amendments will not place any additional reporting burden on the chemical industry as the necessary information is already required to be provided to the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also proposed for the NRA to be able to impose a fee for the issuing of certificates of export. Those certificates relate to requests from the chemical industry or importing countries to establish the bona fides of a particular chemical product following evaluation of the product by the NRA. Appeal provisions to the administrative appeals tribunal will be available to aggrieved applicants in the event of the NRA's refusal to issue a certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 clarify the application of the compensation provisions under part 3 of the code. Those provisions apply when certain information is provided on request to the NRA as part of the review of existing agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The related transitional provisions have also been clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also proposed to introduce provisions to streamline the issuing of national notices under the AGVET codes. This will enable the NRA to issue one national notice rather than separate notices for each jurisdiction, and represents improved efficiency for the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Fisheries Management Act 1991<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>will provide that where there is an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 31 of section 51 of the Constitution, reasonable compensation or compensation as determined by the federal court, is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government announced in the second reading speech to the Wool International Act 1993 that the establishment of Wool International was part of the strategy to develop a much stronger and commercially driven Australian wool industry, in more direct control over its destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government continues to believe that the industry's long term future lies in it continuing to move towards a market driven approach, closely attuned to the needs of customers and end users, and free from unnecessary government involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 is part of this evolutionary process, and includes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">termination of voluntary, or additional, contributions of wool tax over and above 4.5 per cent Of the sale value of shorn wool other than carpet wool;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">setting the amount payable to wool international in respect of the stockpile debt component of wool tax by regulation; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">enabling wool international to undertake a program to develop and evaluate the forward marketing of wool through its subsidiary, wool international holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Voluntary contributions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment by growers of the compulsory 4.5 per cent debt component of wool tax from 1 July 1993 onwards entitles them to a share in any surplus from the sale of the stockpile by wool international, to be made available once the associated government guaranteed debt has been retired, as well as to equity in any privatised Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wool International Act 1993 currently allows these eligible wool tax payers to gain additional entitlements by making voluntary contributions up to 5.5 per cent of the sale value of shorn wool, other than carpet wool, in addition to the 4.5 per cent stockpile debt component of wool tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances in the wool industry have changed markedly since the present statutory framework was put in place in 1993, and there is now anticipated to be in a significant surplus  arising from stockpile sales after the government guaranteed debt has been retired. This has led the board of wool international to recommend that the surplus from the stockpile sales be made available to growers once the government guaranteed debt has been retired, and that any privatisation, if that is the wish of eligible wool tax payers, be funded from the non wool assets of wool international. The government has agreed with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, it is considered there is no justification for eligible wool tax payers retaining the right to make voluntary contributions. In particular, the retention of this right could provide the possibility for a small number of large, well-off, producers to enhance their entitlements at the expense of other eligible wool tax payers, not in a financial position to make voluntary contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government, after consultation with the industry, therefore announced in a media release dated 20 June 1995 that it proposed the legislation be amended to provide for the cessation of voluntary wool tax contributions from that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Setting the debt component of wool tax by regulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the amount payable to wool international in respect of the tax imposed under the wool tax acts on shorn wool, other than carpet wool, is prescribed in the Wool International Act 1993 at 4.5 per cent. These payments go to service stockpile debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the May 1995 annual general conference of the Wool Council of Australia, it was announced that the government had agreed to conduct a review of the 4.5 per cent component of wool tax payable to Wool International. This decision was taken in the context of the significant projected surplus of funds in Wool International once the government guaranteed debt has been retired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review, to be conducted in early 1996, will examine if there is scope to reduce or even eliminate this component of the tax from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed legislative changes will enable speedy implementation of the outcome of the review by setting the amount payable to wool international by regulation. The changes will provide only for the amount to be maintained at the current rate of 4.5 per cent, or lowered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future marketing activities of Wool International</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its legislated functions, Wool International has been examining various options for further developing risk management mechanisms for the industry, and it has recommended that its subsidiary, Wool International Holdings, undertake a limited trading program to develop and evaluate forward and futures markets as a risk management tool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 will therefore be necessary to allow Wool International to hold shares in a subsidiary undertaking such a program including the use of futures and currency contracts for hedging purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed amendments, Wool International will require the prior approval of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy before it can commence the trading program using Wool International Holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strict measures to limit the financial risk of the proposal and details of operational aspects, such as reporting requirements, will be specified in the conditions encompassed in the ministerial approval. It is envisaged that the memorandum and articles of Wool International Holdings will need to change to reflect these conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other key points regarding the program are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it will be a `stand alone' commercial operation with a two year time frame commencing in 1996</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it will be funded from revenue received from the management of non-wool assets, as provided for in the existing legislation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there will be no government guarantee involved</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">wool international holdings will have access to the stockpile on a commercial basis only</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">regular reports will be provided to the wool international board, and through it to the minister</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">rigorous risk management arrangements will be put in place to ensure that the operation of the program is conducted within an agreed capital limit</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">separate and transparent accounting will be required</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">subjection to all the requirements of corporations law, and all forms of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of Wool International Holdings will ensure the trading activities are kept separate from those of Wool International proper, whose main legislative concern will remain the management of the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This separation is very important in the context of maintaining market confidence in Wool International's stockpile operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is therefore emphasised that the program undertaken by Wool International Holdings will in no way impact on the disposal of the stockpile under the fixed release schedule. Wool International Holdings will only have access to the stockpile on the same commercial basis as any other industry participant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes the proposed program, which has the full support of the Wool Council of Australia, represents a natural progression in Wool International's efforts to stimulate more effective management of risk in the industry, the need for which has been clearly demonstrated by the current price volatility in the wool market. Unlike most other commodity markets, the wool industry, particularly growers, does not make adequate use of risk management options such as forward selling and futures contracts to manage risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, while the forward trading proposal is ultimately directed towards risk management and strengthening the forward and futures markets for wool, it will also provide valuable information in considering the options regarding a privatisation of Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will assist eligible wool tax payers to evaluate the commercial viability of a privatised organisation undertaking forward marketing operations and providing risk management services. In that way it will help eligible wool tax payers to make a more informed decision regarding privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal does not pre-suppose the eventual privatisation of Wool International. Eligible wool tax payers, through the issue of a prospectus, will have the choice, based on their own commercial judgement, as to whether they leave their equity in a privatised Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Wool International were ultimately to be privatised, the stockpile would nonetheless continue to be managed by a separate entity, probably a statutory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 amend two provisions of the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A consequential amendment to section 51 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Act 1993 is needed to take into account the proposed amendments to the Wool International Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section requires wool tax payers, in recommending the percentages of wool tax payable under the wool tax acts to the Australian wool research and promotion organisation in respect of research and development, and promotion, to have regard to the legislated percentage of wool tax payable to Wool International in respect of debt reduction. Under the proposed amendments, this amount will now be set by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also repeal the provision at section 79 for wool industry funding of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, and substitute this with provision for an industry contribution to the proposed Australian Animal Health Council Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council ceased operations on 30 June 1995, and the proposed Australian Animal Health Council limited will be established as a non-profit company, limited by guarantee, under corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Animal Health Council will be jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth Government, state and territory governments and the peak national representative bodies of Australia's livestock based industries. Its mission will be to ensure the Australian animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wool Council of Australia has sought and supports the amendment. This is an interim measure which will cease to apply after the 1996-97 financial year. The Wool Council is considering alternatives for longer term funding and will advise its position in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support Act 1992 is being amended to ensure that the drought relief payment is payable to eligible farmers only within the period specified on the drought exceptional circumstances certificate. This will ensure that drought relief payments are used by eligible farmers to meet their basic living expenses only during those periods of extreme drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to reinsert drought relief payment to section 43(1) are to correct previous consequential amendments which erroneously omitted drought relief payment from this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 allows persons other than officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to be appointed as authorised officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow quarantine officers of the various state and territory departments of agriculture to be involved in the inspection of food imported into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to clients as a consequence of the amendment as it minimises, where possible, the duplication of inspection activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SYDNEY 2000 GAMES (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to assist in preserving the financial integrity of the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games by facilitating the raising of licensing revenue in relation to the games through the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable Senators would no doubt be aware, the hosting of the Olympic Games in 2000 is an event of great significance to Australia, providing a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. This government was a strong and enthusiastic supporter of the bid for the games and its support and assistance will continue throughout the task of organising the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This task is very large and complex. It is also very expensive. As the host nation for the year 2000 Games, Australia will be expending considerable sums of money in the lead up to the year 2000 to arrange the construction of facilities and infrastructure, organisation and marketing required for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of staging the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games is estimated to be $2 billion, and will be shared between the organising committees, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC), the government of NSW and the Commonwealth Government. As well as providing $150 million toward the cost of staging the Sydney Games and up to $25 million toward the cost of the Paralympics, the Commonwealth Government will provide $140 million to sports in 1995-96. This includes $46 million to Olympic sport through the "Maintain the Momentum" program and the "Olympic Athlete" program ($135 million over six years) which is designed to ensure the best possible preparation of Australia's athletes for the Atlanta and Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sources of revenue to meet the costs of the Sydney Games include the sale of television rights, ticket sales and the licensing of the right to use the games indicia and images. After television rights, licensing, or sponsorship, rights are the most important source of revenue to meet the costs of organising and staging the games. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the revenue budget of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors will depend to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity afforded to the licensed indicia and images. Official sponsors recognise the commercial value of associating themselves with events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games and are willing to pay considerable sums of money to use the words and symbols associated with the Olympics. In this regard, I note that SOCOG has recently announced that Telstra and IBM are to jointly contribute more than $100 million as the first members of Team Millennium, the corporate sponsorship program for the Sydney 2000 Games&mdash;the deal was negotiated in anticipation of the strengthening of the legislative protection of intellectual property rights associated with the Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Ambush marketing", however, has the capacity to erode seriously the official sponsorship revenue if not stopped or minimised. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Games, without paying for marketing rights. Typically it is the competitors of official sponsors of major sporting events that engage in these activities. Australian and overseas experience of recent Olympic Games has highlighted the threat that uncontrolled ambush marketing activities can pose to the value of exclusive licensing rights on Olympic Games symbols and indicia. Because ambush marketing can be very effective in creating a perception that the "free-rider" is in fact an official sponsor, it can dissuade official sponsors from continuing their association with the Olympics, or substantially reduce the amount sponsors are prepared to pay for the rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preservation of sponsorship revenue is fundamental to achieving a sound financial outcome for the games thereby ensuring the least call on the public purse. The Government of NSW has underwritten and bears full responsibility for any deficit between the games income and expenditure. The protection of official sponsorships against ambush marketing is therefore critical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government has always recognised the importance of protecting the sponsorship revenue. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the commonwealth, endorsed the bid, noting the provisions of the host city contract, and undertook to make every effort to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made. The government has long been supportive of the Australian Olympic Committee in its endeavours to ensure appropriate protection for Olympic symbols such as the five rings and the designs of the Olympic flame and torch&mdash;the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 was put in place expressly for that purpose. That act was amended in 1994 to extend the protection available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides additional protection to try to ensure a good budget outcome for the Sydney Games. It will protect the use of a wide range of words and expressions against ambush marketing during the lead up to and including the Sydney Games. It will pick up most of the recommendations made in March 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report entitled Cashing in on the Sydney Olympics: Protecting the Sydney Olympic Games from Ambush Marketing. The bill will have a limited period of application and will cease to have effect after 31 December 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I would now briefly outline significant features of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to provide protection to indicia encompassing words and expressions associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Words and phrases such as "Olympic", "Olympiad", "Paralympic", "Paralympiad", "Sydney 2000", "Sydney Games",  "Millennium  Games"  and  "Summer Games" will be protected against unlicensed commercial use under this legislation. Particular word combinations will also be protected under this legislation. These include, for example, any combinations of the words "Olympics", "Olympian", "Paralympics" and "Paralympian" with words, numbers or phrases such as "Sydney", "2000', "Two Thousand", "Games", "Medals", "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze", "Green and Gold" and "Sponsor".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to protecting particular words, numbers and expressions, the bill also seeks to provide protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games. These images may be either visual or aural representations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rights in the above protected indicia and images vest with SOCOG and SPOC. These two bodies have the power to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the legislation for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To constitute use for commercial purposes, the Sydney Games indicia or images must be applied to a person's goods or services for advertising or promotional purposes, or for enhancing the demand for the goods or services, and in a manner which would suggest that the person is a sponsor of, or has an association with, the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games or both. That is, a person who sells or promotes their goods or services by using any of the protected indicia or images in a way that would be reasonably understood as suggesting that the person is claiming a connection with the games would be using them for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to enable the public to be aware of the identity of those licensed to use the Sydney Games indicia and images, a register will be established and maintained by SOCOG and made accessible to members of the public at its office in Sydney. The register will also be accessible throughout Australia at State Offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. An entry in the register will include details such as the name and principal place of business of the licensed user, the Sydney Games indicia and images that the licensed user may use and the circumstances in which the indicia and images may be used. A person whose name is entered on the register is to be taken to be a licensed user of the Sydney Games indicia or images specified in that entry. A document certified by the Chief Executive Officer of SOCOG is evidence that the particulars set out in the document are entered in the register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, however, is not about placing an absolute fetter on any use of the protected Sydney Games indicia and images. The government recognises that while the preservation of sponsorship revenue is essential to achieving a good budget outcome for the games, the fundamental rights of the community to freedom of expression must be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of the Sydney Games indicia and images will apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, it is made clear in the bill that the legislation is not intended to affect the working of many aspects of everyday business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that some individuals and corporations already use the indicia prescribed in the legislation in conjunction with their goods and services. There are for example goods and services which either have the trade marks "Olympic" or include the word "Olympic", such as "Olympic tyres" and "Olympic Airways". This legislation is not about stopping traders who have been using these indicia and images for years from continuing that use. The established rights of owners of registered trade marks or designs containing those indicia and images remain unaffected so long as the trade marks or designs are not used in a way so as to imply a connection to the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the Sydney Games indicia or images solely for the purposes of providing information, or for the purposes of criticism or review, is not of itself prohibited. Examples of such provision of information include the reporting of news and presentation of current affairs, the factual description of goods or services provided by a business (such as stating that accommodation is available at a hotel that is located near the Olympic site), or the factual description by an athlete of their performance and achievements. Examples of criticism and review are those which are likely to appear in newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals, in a radio or television broadcast, or in a cinematographic film.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fundraising for and promotion of their preparation of athletes and teams for the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games should be allowed to continue. Those reasonable needs could involve use of the Sydney Games indicia or images for the purposes of providing factual information. As I have just explained, the bill is not intended to affect this type of use. Nevertheless, as I noted when I presented the government's response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's report, the government believes that, in the interests of clarity and certainty, it would be desirable for sporting bodies to negotiate Memoranda of Understanding with SOCOG to cover their proposed use of the Sydney Games indicia and images. Such a Memorandum is currently under negotiation between the Australian Sports Commission and SOCOG.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides various remedies to SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to enforce their rights in relation to the Sydney Games indicia and images. Thus, where an unlicensed user uses Sydney Games indicia or images in contravention of the bill, SOCOG, SPOC or a relevant licensed user may bring an action against the unlicensed user. The remedies available under the bill include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising. However, in addition to those remedies, the courts have the discretion to provide remedies under any law (whether a law of the commonwealth, a state or a territory) that confers any rights or powers on SOCOG, SPOC or a licensed user. Most notable in this regard are the remedies provided under the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes appropriate customs measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which seek to ambush the Olympic Games marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The on-going cost to the government of administering this legislation will be minimal. The Australian Customs Service will be able to carry out the measures of this legislation relating to the monitoring of imported goods at the barrier within their existing resources. It is likely that the increased security of the Olympic 2000 indicia and images will enhance SOCOG's and SPOC's capacity to ensure the financial viability of the 2000 Games through its marketing program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the bill introduces significant protection for the Sydney Games indicia and images. The protection provided by this bill will both complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws to ensure, to the extent possible, that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill amends the act that established the Australian Sports Drug Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will enhance the international leadership role that Australia has established in the fight against the use of prohibited drugs in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) to work more co-operatively with International Sporting Federations to conduct an annual program of drug tests both at major sporting events and out-of-competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also ensure that Australia's successful anti-doping programs operate even more efficiently and effectively. Under this legislation, our drug testing programs will continue to deter athletes from using drugs while at the same time ensuring that the rights of athletes undergoing drug testing will not be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, this bill will reduce the likelihood of successful legal challenges to positive drug tests based on minor or trivial technicalities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASDA was established as a statutory authority on 18 February 1991&mdash;a speedy response by the government to recommendations of the then Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to say that following the establishment of ASDA, Australia has become recognised around the world as a leader in the international fight against doping in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment ASDA has had remarkable success. I would like to share some of the highlights with you.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASDA has arranged for more than 15,000 drug tests to be conducted and has implemented comprehensive education programs throughout schools and sporting organisations in Australia. All these drug tests are analysed by the internationally accredited Australian Sports Drug Testing laboratory in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the last year more than 3,000 drug tests were undertaken with more than 99% being "drug free".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was also the first non-European country to accede to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention aimed at harmonising anti-doping programs among countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our substantial international achievements were possible only because we have strong and successful national programs. I was pleased to report that a National Drugs in Sport Framework was endorsed earlier this month by the commonwealth, state and territory Sports Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All those ministers recognise that achieving the objectives of this anti-doping initiative will result in:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">athletes around Australia being exposed to consistent drug testing programs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">opportunities for all elite athletes to receive sport drug education;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an emphasis on promoting the ethos that the use of drugs to enhance sports performance is cheating; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">improvements in the expertise of government and sport to develop effective drugs in sport policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These objectives will be achieved through the co-ordinated action of all governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective anti-doping programs that deter athletes and their associates from cheating need to recognise that everyone must be treated in a fair and just way. The Framework recognises the principle of natural justice and the need to respect the rights of individuals, particularly the rights of young athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of this framework involved all key players in the sport industry in both the government and non-government sectors. It was pleasing to note that the Confederation of Australian Sport (representing more than 100 national sporting organisations) acknowledges the importance of this anti-doping initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This national initiative will be critical in achieving the government's goal of a drug free Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's strong and committed anti-doping stance was considered a significant factor in Sydney's successful bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games. This success provides Australia with a unique opportunity to further address a concern of the Australian sporting community with the lack of an international level playing field in respect to doping. With the international sporting spotlight firmly on Sydney after the Atlanta games, Australia is well placed to continue demonstrating leadership through its effective domestic anti-doping programs and to advocate to the international sporting community the need for, and benefits of, a dedicated anti-doping effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July this year, the government endorsed a comprehensive package of measures aimed at pursuing a drug free 2000 Olympic Games. These measures include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a drug testing program targeting international athletes competing and training in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">advocating out-of-competition testing programs by International Sporting Federations that target their top athletes on an annual basis;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">drug testing programs by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) at the 2000 Olympics and the test events leading up to the games;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the maintenance of an internationally accredited drug testing laboratory in Australia and continuing research to ensure new doping practices can be detected;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">education programs throughout school and sporting communities;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">anti-doping agreements between Australia and other countries; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">measures to reduce both the prescribing and illicit supply of performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of measures will be implemented by key organisations from the sport, health, education and law enforcement agencies in the government and non-government sectors. The Australian Olympic Committee and SOCOG will also play a critical role in the fight against drugs in sport. It is encouraging to see that SOCOG has already established its drug testing expert committee which has a very strong ASDA involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A drug free Sydney 2000 will also require the co-operation of international sporting organisations. Towards this end, the government has already signed a tri-partite anti-doping agreement with the International Olympic Committee and SOCOG.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our anti-doping effort will not only be critical to the sporting and financial success of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games but it also has the potential to re-establish the credibility of international sport by encouraging the international sporting community to embrace a drug-free sporting ethos and by providing a launching pad to take this ethos into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will help achieve this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill and our anti-doping policies are about sportsmen and sportswomen and their right to compete in drug-free sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason the government has made a great effort to understand the concerns of our athletes and to ask them if they think our anti-doping programs are successful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 1994 survey of elite athletes in Australia showed that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">they believe that ASDA's drug testing program is likely to deter elite athletes from using prohibited drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is a high degree of satisfaction with all aspects of the ASDA testing program, including the conduct of ASDA personnel;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">73% of elite athletes rated ASDA successful at balancing an individual's right to privacy with the need to maximise the deterrent effect of the drug testing program;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the way ASDA works in the sporting community has received wide endorsement with the majority of all elite athletes suggesting ASDA consults successfully with sport;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the wide range of sources of information on drugs in sport utilised by elite athletes reflects a generally better informed and aware sporting community; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">86% of elite athletes believe that an independent national organisation, such as  ASDA, should be responsible for drug testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall conclusion from this survey is that our approach to the drugs in sport issue has been successful. Information collected over the past three years suggests that in the core areas of drug testing, education and policy work, ASDA has made and sustained a positive impact within the sporting community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These views support the results of the 1993 Mugford Report titled The Value of Sport, Ethics and the Control of Performance Enhancing Drugs: A Study in the Australian Sports Community which states that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">athletes perceive the use of drugs for performance enhancement primarily as cheating;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASDA is succeeding in creating a climate where athletes are committed to the rules rather than simply obeying them because of the fear of detection, i.e. conformity rather than compliance;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">this climate makes use of performance enhancing drugs much harder for athletes to justify; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">sports people identified a definite value to society created by sport and it is clear that drug testing and educational programs undertaken by ASDA protect that value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is clear our anti-doping policy has been successful, we must not become complacent. The amendments in this bill will ensure that our anti-doping programs can operate optimally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill refines the Australian Sports Drug Agency's objectives to ensure the ongoing relevance of the Agency to the continuing fight against drugs in sport. The amendments do not significantly alter these objectives but expresses them in terms of outcomes rather than outputs. As a result the revised objectives emphasise ASDA's deterrence, educational and national and international advocacy roles. ASDA's revised objectives are to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">deter the use of scheduled drugs or doping methods in sport;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community about matters relating to drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">advocate the international adoption of consistent and effective anti-doping programs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">co-ordinate the development of a consistent and effective national response to matters relating to drugs in sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also refines ASDA's functions to clearly identify a range of strategies to be implemented by the Agency to achieve the proposed outcome-oriented objectives. These functions are to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">develop and implement drug testing programs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">advocate the international development and implementation of consistent and effective anti-doping programs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">encourage Australian national sporting organisations, state and territory sporting organisations and professional sporting organisations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)to develop and implement comprehensive and consistent anti-doping initiatives (including initiatives relating to testing for the use of drugs and education about matters relating to drugs in sport); and</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">co-operate with those departments and authorities and with non-government sporting organisations to implement those initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also enable ASDA to work more co-operatively with International Sporting Federations in conducting effective drug testing programs. The agency is increasingly being asked by these federations to undertake testing on their behalf and ASDA can expect an increase in the number of requests for testing in the lead-up to the Sydney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there is no uniform international procedure for sample collection and testing. Most International Sporting Federations have sample collection procedures that differ from each other in a number of small variations. These variations have made it difficult for ASDA to undertake testing on behalf of International Sporting Federations as the procedures do not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of the current ASDA legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will permit the agency to overcome this problem and undertake testing for International Sporting Federations, either at international events being held in Australia or when contracted to conduct other event and out-of-competition testing, even in those cases where International Sporting Federations' procedures are slightly different to the procedures outlined in the ASDA legislation which, of course are primarily designed for our domestic testing regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in no way suggests that the existing high standards will be diminished in any way. The amendments provided by this bill simply identify the procedures which ASDA must strictly comply with to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the drug test result. They also identify those procedures which require only substantial compliance. This will enable the agency to recognise drug test results even if there are minor irregularities provided those irregularities do not cast doubt on the actual test results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been framed following widespread consultation throughout the sporting and legal communities and other interested parties. This includes the Australian Olympic Committee, the Confederation of Australian Sport, National Sporting Organisations, Australia &amp; New Zealand Sports Law Association and the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation reflects the privacy and human rights principles laid down in other commonwealth legislation. In particular, only those who need to have access to information will be informed. The government has also been concerned to protect the rights of athletes and has built into the legislation certain appeal rights to ensure athletes are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative and operational expenses related to staff and program costs will be determined annually in the Budget. The appropriation to ASDA for 1995-96 is $3.412 million. This includes an allocation to undertake 2,500 "public interest" drug tests on Australian athletes and international athletes who train or compete in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that ASDA will generate additional income approaching $0.5 million each year from "user pay" education and testing services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this legislation is even more evidence of this government's commitment to drug free sport. A commitment that is underpinned by an allocation of $20 million for anti-doping programs between now and the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. This sends a clear message to both the Australian and international sporting communities that we intend to "beat the cheats".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also sends an important message to our drug free athletes that this government intends to do everything possible to ensure that Australian sportsmen and sportswomen are able to compete in sport which is free from banned doping practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that all Senators want to ensure that our sporting tradition for fair play remains an integral part of our sporting success and that our children can inherit sport free from the use of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (BETTER BUSINESS CONDUCT) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small businesses make up 96 per cent of all firms in Australia and account for 45 percent of all employment. Increasingly, jobs growth is being fuelled by the demands of the small business sector. Many of Australia's most innovative firms are small businesses. These firms are critical to the export growth of Australia's manufacturing and service industries and are at the forefront of the push into Asia. Therefore, when small businesses complain that they are being unfairly exploited, there is good cause to listen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small businesses have long argued that they are not getting a fair go, and that the protections offered by the Trade Practices Act 1974 do not give relief from a range of unfair practices. Many of the concerns raised by small business are simply the result of competitive forces in the marketplace and thus do not justify a legislative response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There remains, however, some practices of legitimate concern which are not prohibited by the Trade Practices Act 1974. Circumstances can arise where a firm cannot, due to the actions of another, protect their interests and are subject to exploitation in a manner unsustainable in a competitive and open market. The exploitation of small firms in existing commercial relationships denies many firms the capacity to develop and is an impediment to growth in this important sector of the economy. This bill seeks to remove such impediments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it should not be forgotten that the market is a hard place. It is the nature of business that all firms seek to maximise their returns. The government recognises this and does not propose to prevent hard bargains being struck, provided that they are struck fairly. It is not the intention of this bill to protect firms from their own mistakes, nor is it intended to provide them with a guarantee of business success. It is about restoring choice to commercial bargains and allowing those who are denied choice the opportunity to take steps to protect their own interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a bill to prohibit harsh or oppressive outcomes. Agreements with such outcomes, freely entered into and consequent of full disclosure, must be allowed to stand. This is, however, a bill that addresses those commercial relationships where one of the parties has no choice. Further, the bill only targets conduct that is harsh or oppressive and not in the present or future legitimate interests of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern has been raised in some quarters that this bill undermines primacy of contract and threatens the fabric of Australian commercial activity. Australia's strict laws of contract are a comparative advantage in the Asia-Pacific region, and assist in attracting investment into this country. The government recognises this, and the bill preserves the advantages that certainty of contract gives to the business environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is limited in the scope of its application to businesses in a pre-existing commercial relationship. The reason for this limitation is that, however painful the decision, businesses that have no sunk costs in a commercial relationship can walk away if the terms and conditions are not commensurate with the return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the bill also only apply to commercial relationships of major significance to one of the parties to the arrangement. This is not a bill to provide relief from every provision that a firm finds inconvenient or burdensome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is concerned with prohibiting the exploitation of a party denied commercial choice by virtue of the particular relationship they have with another firm. It is not about providing relief for firms from downturns in the market or industry wide practices. For example, the forced reduction in the price paid to automotive component suppliers by the major car companies would not be covered by this legislation as it arises from changes affecting the Australian car industry as a whole, namely exposure to international competition. It is legitimate for the major car companies to seek to force reductions in price on their suppliers as the level of competition in the sector increases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the bill is confined to the exploitation of a particular commercial relationship. A company that chooses to engage in a common set of conduct across all commercial relationships is not exploiting any one particular arrangement. In a competitive market, a company which unfairly exploits all its commercial relationships is likely, in the long term, to do greater commercial damage to itself than to any one party with whom it deals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even when conduct is found to be harsh or oppressive it may be justified by specific considerations which are peculiar to the particular relationship. The bill reflects this by allowing reference to the whole of the commercial relationship and the surrounding circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In markets where competition is reduced, such as in markets where the company has a substantial degree of market power, existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act governing the misuse of market power prevent the exploitation of firms. This bill addresses discriminatory conduct, where a company exploits a particular relationship to seek extra-market rents unsustainable in the open market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be recognised that a number of industry sectors have already taken steps to address the matters covered by this bill. This is to be commended. Many landlords, including the larger ones, have adopted practices that recognise the mutually dependent nature of their relationship with their tenants. The government welcomes the cooperation between the Building Owners and Managers Association and the Retailers Council of Australia on encouraging better business conduct between landlords and their tenants. This bill supports these changes in leasing practices, by capturing those firms that refuse to comply with industry developed norms of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government welcomes moves towards industry codes of self-regulation as they create a regulatory environment protects all participants while allowing for a flexibility for change that legislation cannot deliver. This bill, with the other provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974, provides a legislative safety net for industry codes of practice, reducing the level of regulation that would otherwise be necessary for many industry sectors. By listing adherence to self-regulatory codes as a factor which a court may have regard to in determining whether conduct is harsh or oppressive, the bill explicitly recognises the important role these codes play in establishing acceptable standards of business conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is seen as an important facet of the regulatory framework for the petroleum and franchising sectors. Smaller participants in these industries, concerned at their relative lack of commercial independence from larger corporations, have welcomed these measures, as they provide protection from abuse while not involving the government in the everyday operations of their businesses. These firms have stated that they do not want heavy-handed government regulation of their dynamic industry sectors. They want an environment where they are protected from exploitation but where commercial success depends on their own commitment and business acumen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been drafted with a view to providing realistic and effective protection without imposing unacceptable compliance costs upon business. The bill provides for better business conduct whilst not having any financial implications for the government. It is consistent with the government's policy of `minimum effective regulation'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill aims to improve standards of business conduct, and does not seek to rely on enforcement for its effect. Where matters still result in dispute, the bill, through its support of industry codes of behaviour, favours mediation. Court action is a costly exercise, in both time and money, that many businesses cannot afford. The government supports moves which reduce the burden on the court system such as mediation of disputes, particularly under mechanisms arising out of industry-specific codes of practice. Willingness to subject disputes to arbitration rather than pursuing the claims in courts should be encouraged and taken as a commitment by the parties to making business relationships work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a small business protection act. It is about allowing businesses to operate to the best of their abilities in an open market. Under the bill, firms still have a overriding onus to look after their own interests and to protect themselves against exploitation. Only where a corporation knowingly denies a firm this opportunity, or ought reasonably to have known that this was likely, will the bill provide relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is about changing the way firms interact so that those with significant interdependence cannot ignore the impact of their decisions on those bound to them. It is a bill that recognises that improved standards of business conduct benefit all firms and encourage higher growth and greater economic prosperity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 8 December 1994 the Senate asked the committee to inquire into the Commonwealth's treaty making power, which is also often referred to as the `external affairs power'. The committee consulted widely in relation to this reference. It conducted public hearings in all capital cities, except Darwin, and it received 157 written submissions. This perhaps has been the most comprehensive review devoted solely to the operation of the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I wish to place on record my appreciation to the committee secretariat, especially for the outstanding work by Anne Twomey, Catherine Hawkins and Peter Thomson. They have given the committee invaluable assistance during the last 12 months. I also wish to thank fellow committee members for their contributions and application to what has been, I think, one of the most important reports handed down by a Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of central issues arose from the evidence which the committee received. These concerns related to the impact of international treaties on the Australian federal system and the sovereignty of the nation; the degree of consultation undertaken by the government prior to entering into and ratifying treaties; and the issue of the respective roles of the parliament, the government, and especially the executive, in treaty making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative power to implement treaties in domestic law is governed by section 51(xxix) of the Constitution and, as I have stated previously, is commonly known as the `external affairs power'. At Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth government did not possess the executive power to enter into treaties. This prerogative remained with the United Kingdom. Australia subsequently became an independent nation, capable of entering into treaties on its own behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current interpretation of the external affairs power is that it is an independent plenary head of power that supports laws with respect to matters that are physically external to Australia and laws affecting Australia's relations with other nations. The power also supports legislation that implements Australia's obligations under treaties, regardless of whether the treaties' subject matter is otherwise constitutionally within the Commonwealth's legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the High Court decision of Teoh demonstrated the increasing importance of the impact of treaties on Australian law and, I would say, supports the necessity for greater parliamentary involvement in the treaty making process. It is argued that the wide interpretation of the external affairs power to cover matters that are not external to Australia may threaten the continued existence of the Australian federation; that is, a wide interpretation of the external affairs power might permit the Commonwealth to extend its legislative competence to cover areas previously considered to be within the domain of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1973 with the Seas and Submerged Lands decision, the High Court has been seen to broaden the application of the external affairs provision. I would suggest to the Senate that that was part of the concern put to the committee during its hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 11 recommendations made; they were unanimous. The first dealt with the information provided to the public at large in relation to the treaties that were entered into. Although it is stated that Australia is party to approximately 920 treaties, there is still some uncertainty as to that exact number. Accordingly, the committee considers that it is necessary for the government to conduct an audit of treaties to determine the precise scope of Australia's international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended that the government report annually to the parliament on measures it has taken to implement treaties in the previous year. The committee also considered that a treaties database should be established by the government, and that it should be readily accessible by the public free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that was raised before the committee was about consultation. The committee was concerned that the public does not have access to adequate information and is not adequately consulted by the government prior to ratification of treaties. In some cases, the government may consult only the peak body in relation to a particular interest group. However, in relation to some groups a peak body may not be as representative of that interest group as the government may believe. Therefore, the committee considers the government should endeavour to consult widely with all relevant groups to overcome such problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee went on to consider the role of the states and territories and, I might add, the states and territories were united in their submission to the committee that there should be a further body, a treaties council, set up in addition to the Standing Committee on Treaties. The Standing Committee on Treaties comprises public officials and the committee thought it was desirable not to duplicate the process and form another body but simply build on the Standing Committee on Treaties and establish a treaties council. This treaties council, however, should be made up of elected representatives from the parliaments of the states and territories. That would mean that you would have representatives from both state governments and oppositions and territorial governments and oppositions. As well as that, the committee recommended that on the council there should also be representatives from the federal government, federal opposition and minor parties in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended that there should be a joint parliamentary treaties committee which would be able to review treaties prior to ratification. The committee recommended that the government should table treaties at least 15 sitting days prior to ratification and thereby provide an opportunity for the parliament to refer to a joint parliamentary treaty any treaty under consideration. Wide powers would then be afforded to that joint parliamentary committee to inquire into and report on the treaty concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some mention made of amendment to the constitution. The committee was of the view that that was not an option available unless there was bipartisan support and that, accordingly, legislation to regulate the exercise of the external affairs power was a more preferable option. There was also some mention made of the fact that there should be parliamentary approval of treaties. The committee stressed that parliament should not be involved in the negotiating of treaties but that the question of any parliamentary approval should be referred to the joint parliamentary committee for its consideration. The committee was of the opinion that this was such an important matter that it required a discrete debate in relation to this issue alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, these recommendations were unanimous. They are indeed ground breaking. They take us to an area in relation to the external affairs power where this country has never been before. I believe that if these recommendations are accepted you will have increased consultation with not only the states and territories but also the community at large. I believe these recommendations would go a long way to addressing the concerns that were put to the committee. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of the committee to briefly comment on this report: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or treaty? Commonwealth Power to Make and Implement Treaties</EMPHASIS>. It is a report that has had considerable work expended on it, and I wish to commend the Chairman, Senator Chris Ellison, for his leadership that has made this report and its weightiness, in more ways than one, possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to members of the secretariat, in particular Ms Catherine Hawkins, Ms Jane Grace and Mr Steven Bull. All of them contributed to this report and worked extremely enthusiastically and diligently. I do not want to forget the deputy chairman of the committee, Senator Barney Cooney, who contributed untiringly to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ellison said, the area of treaties requires careful consideration. This country and this parliament have often been placed in the position where treaties which have had domestic consequences have been concluded by the executive government of Australia. Very often when we talk about that, the international treaty relating to human rights is mentioned. I believe those developments are extremely positive. The Australian Democrats have supported them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our opinions are coloured very often by the content of the treaties. The Democrats are not happy about some treaties, such as the treaty relating to the World Trade Organisation which committed us to certain action under GATT. That very much highlights the situation that this parliament and the community at large must be involved in the discussion of treaties and must be able to contribute views and opinions and have a substantive debate on significant treaties before they are concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the recent Teoh case, which has been met by the government's action with the so-called anti-Teoh bill which says that there is no such thing as any expectation that public officials will act in accordance with international conventions and treaties that Australia has ratified and signed, I still believe that obligations on the part of Australia are created and that the international community will expect Australia to act in accordance with commitments it has made in treaties and that parliament should not be in a position to be compelled to meet these international obligations that the government has created without first having had an opportunity to come to grips with the details of the commitment that we are entering into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has weighed carefully a number of avenues to achieve that. As Senator Ellison said, the committee recommended the creation of a treaties council with very wide representation. Some people might say that it is too unwieldy and too large because it is proposed that the council have representation not only from the Commonwealth government and all state governments but also representatives from oppositions and representatives of so-called minor parties. The reason&mdash;and I believe it is a sound one&mdash;is that this council is not a decision making body but is a consultative body. Its establishment is only a recommendation at this stage. I hope the recommendation is accepted by parliament. It will be established as a dragnet measure to flush out all concerns in the nation about a proposed treaty that creates obligations on behalf of Australia. If you look at it from that point of view, I believe there is a strong case for wide representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommends the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to have treaties referred to it, to examine them in detail and to report to parliament on them. I believe that is the appropriate place for treaties to be carefully considered and for the recommendation to be made to the parliament as to the value or otherwise on the treaty. It is appropriate that such a committee be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a brief comment on the bill that Democrat Senator Vicki Bourne introduced. Its provisions require that parliament approve certain important bills before they are signed. The committee has not been able to reach a decision that it wholeheartedly recommends that procedure, but it has decided that how legislative provisions, and what legislative provisions, should be made to achieve parliamentary approval of certain classes of treaty should be referred to that committee. It does require further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I would like to comment on is the provisions which ensure that widespread consultation and the provision of information throughout the community are undertaken. It is not an easy or light matter for a country to accept international obligations by way of treaty, and it is proper and fitting that, as the community becomes politically more interested and politically more expert, it should have an opportunity to comment; it should have an opportunity to express an opinion on the content of those treaties. I commend the committee's report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the remarks so far made by Senator Ellison and Senator Spindler and go on to say that this is a groundbreaking report. I think it is going to be the first of a series of reports about an issue which is of growing importance, not only to Australia but to the world as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I perhaps rather rudely left a person in my room. I said I would go around and make some comments on this. The person was Pierre-Michel Fontaine, who is the regional representative for Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He is about to leave Australia in this area after doing what I think everybody would agree is outstanding and very effective service here. He is returning to Geneva. I think it is a great loss to Australia that he is going back to Geneva, but there you are. I would like to pay tribute to him. It is an indication of just how important international relations are, and it is important since they are of that pre-eminence in our life that they be dealt with properly. I think this is a landmark report that will begin, as I say, what I hope is a greater and deeper consideration of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A remarkable feature of this report is that it is a unanimous report, and I think that is a tribute to all those on the committee, in particular Senator Ellison. This is an area where it is quite clear from debates in this chamber that there are differences of opinion about how external affairs should go. To get a unanimous report and a series of recommendations which are the basis for a very important development is I think a great tribute to the chair, Senator Ellison, in addition to the rest of the committee. So I would like to pay tribute to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you get people on the committee such as Senator McKiernan and Senator Abetz, and Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette were participating members, I think it was a task that only great leadership could bring to fruition. So I would like to pay tribute to Senator Ellison in that respect. I notice that one of the participating members is Senator Kemp, and I think that, although Senator Kemp has pursued this area of considerations to great effect, it took a person like Senator Ellison to tie it all together in the way it has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think Senator Ellison and the rest of the committee would agree that great tribute must be paid to the committee secretary, Anne Twomey, and to Peter Thomson, who left part way through the report. He was doing outstanding work in this area, but that was ably taken over by Catherine Hawkins. I wanted to pick them out because they were the ones amongst a secretariat which I think is probably the busiest secretariat not only in the Senate but in Parliament House. Their workload is cruel, to say the least, and how they produce reports like this of such quality time and time again is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not even given the staff a Christmas party. It is a dreadful business. We will have to do something. That is the only discordant note&mdash;having worked this committee into the ground for the year, we have not as yet done anything for them. We should give them perhaps a couple of packets of peanuts and at least a glass of water: we should do something. In all seriousness, I think all of us would gather together in saying we have nothing but the utmost respect, if not the utmost awe, for the way these people have gone about their business. </PARA>

It was a great honour to serve on that committee and be part of the unanimous recommendations that are now before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clearly is a watershed report. I want to pay a tribute to all my fellow senators who sat on that committee and also to the staff for their intellectual prowess, their sharpness and their capacity to actively engage in debate with us senators as to the consequences of certain propositions that we put up in deciding what the terms of our report ought be. I just want to place that on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my first speech in this place I made reference to my concerns about the international treaty making process and the way that that was having an adverse influence on the federal-state relations within our Commonwealth structure. I note that after my first speech one Senator Rod Kemp came up to me and said it was nice to know somebody else was interested in treaties. Senator Kemp was one of the driving forces in this Senate, and indeed within the Australian public, to highlight some of the difficulties occasioned by the treaty making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that needs to be stressed, as Senator Cooney did, is that this is a unanimous report. Once again, that shows and points out to the community at large the very good work that the Senate and its committee system undertakes. I know that there is a certain gentleman in another place who refers to us as `unrepresentative swill' but I have to say that when you have documents of this nature produced by this house on a unanimous basis the people of Australia can be absolutely satisfied that the Senate does work, that the Senate committee structure works very well for the betterment of our political processes and for the betterment of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations of the report which I am delighted with is recommendation No. 9, which does suggest that there ought be, if you like, an impact statement on the domestic law of Australia pursuant to any treaty that we might sign, because so often we have signed treaties with scant regard for the domestic consequences of signing those treaties. We then have federal governments abusing those treaties for their own domestic purposes. I remember the heartache I went through at about this time last year when I was unable to vote with my colleagues in relation to the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill because of the adverse impact that was going to have on the Commonwealth-state relations and the way that got its legal foundation through an international treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told at the time by an Attorney-General who was beating his breast that we had an international obligation to pass this legislation; it was absolutely vital. But then, of course, when the High Court made a decision against the federal government in relation to the Teoh decision, all of a sudden all those international obligations were thrown out the window and we had a situation where the government then introduced legislation to overturn the impact of the international obligations&mdash;which, of course, shows the two-faced approach that the federal government has adopted to international treaty making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is to be an impact statement or an audit of the impact of international treaties on domestic legislation, we will then find out the true consequences of signing up on treaties. Some would argue that the Convention on the Rights of the Child, for example, would not allow for corporal punishment of children. I would have thought that 80 or 90 per cent of the Australian population believe that loving discipline of children can include an aspect of corporal punishment. Of course, the federal Attorney-General quite properly has dismissed the outlawing of corporal punishment pursuant to that convention. But, quite frankly, if that is the Australian domestic line, then we should not have signed that international treaty. Recommendation 9 requiring this audit or impact statement on the domestic legislation prior to signing a treaty I think will be of great benefit for the treaties council and for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe it has been agreed that we should all limit our comments as much as possible. May I simply make this other comment? I personally believe that, ultimately, there ought be an amendment to the constitution, but it is more important for us to get a unanimous report and that was why I was more than willing to go along with this unanimous report rather than suggest that the constitution be amended, because I am sure that we would not get bipartisan support for such a suggestion. I believe that this report is a victory for parliamentary democracy, for the people of Australia and for commonsense. I commend the report to the Senate and the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>Before I start speaking on this report, I would like to pay special tribute to the staff of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee for taking a reference at very short notice and, in a very short space of time, producing a report of such excellent quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee believes that the sale of Bond University, one of only two existing private universities in Australia, to a public university represents a threat to national interests. The committee has focused its attention on three issues: firstly, the risk to public money; secondly, the potential of the bid to change by stealth higher education policy, including no fees for undergraduate study by Australian students; and, thirdly, the impact the purchase will have on the independence of Bond and, hence, on the diversity of choice in higher education options in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the safety of public money, the committee had two main concerns. The first of these relates to the initial purchase. The university's bid is believed to be around $110 million and the University of Queensland has assured the committee that no public funding or assets will be used to purchase the land and building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How such a risk of $110 million debt is to the public purse depends very much on the nature of the securities given. This raises the key question: in the event of the venture failing, how would the bank redeem its debt? The committee believes, on the evidence to date, that there is still a risk to public money. The committee is unconvinced that the assets which would be used as security equate to the value of the loan that they are held against. Moreover, what government is going to take the risk of damaging the reputation of one of its leading public universities by not coming to the rescue in the event of a default?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges that the University of Queensland has offered to enter into a formal agreement with DEET to subject to public scrutiny all its operations with respect to Bond. The committee has been unable to obtain enough detail about the form of this agreement to assess its value or enforceability. Therefore, we are being asked at this stage to take a lot on faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cross-subsidisation between a public and private university is also of considerable concern. In the long term the potential for direct cross-subsidisation is far greater, particularly in the event of the University of Queensland developing a contiguous public campus, as foreshadowed at Robina. The committee considers that there are grounds for concern here. According to some witnesses, such arrangements would almost inevitably lead to cross-subsidisation. While the safety of public money may be the most immediate of the concerns raised by the sale of Bond University campus, the sale is also seen to represent a real threat to aspects of current higher education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to the committee is the threat to the policy of no up-front fees for undergraduate studies for Australian students. The committee acknowledges that the current government policy does, in theory, prohibit the charging of up-front fees to Australian undergraduate students. However, this official position has been undermined by a number of developments over recent years: firstly, the existence of at least a partial legitimisation of the user pay principle through the introduction of HECS; secondly, the opening up of some post-graduate courses to full fee-paying arrangements; and, thirdly, the use of commercial arms of universities to offer fee-paying courses for which credit may be subsequently given as part of an undergraduate degree. In this context, the sale of Bond University can be seen as having the potential to undermine the policy of no fees for undergraduate study by Australian students even further. It is the committee's view that such a debate is appropriate at the present stage of development of higher education systems and this is encompassed in our first recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia's commitment to a high quality public system of higher education is unlikely to diminish, it is important that any developments in the private sphere with respect to higher education are guided by suitable government policy. Only then will the interests of both public and private sectors be served. To this end, the committee has recommended that the Senate and Commonwealth government encourage and facilitate a broad public debate on issues arising at the interface between the public and private activities of universities, on the role of the non-government sector in the provision of higher government, and the implications of these matters for higher education policy and funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest concerns to the committee related to the implications for Bond University's independence of the University of Queensland with the University of Queensland being a landlord and member of Bond's council. The committee regards a pure landlord-tenant relationship between the University of Queensland and Bond as considerably less threatening to the public perceptions of Bond's independence than a more direct involvement of the University of Queensland in Bond's affairs. However, on balance it regards such a relationship as conducive to a public perception that Bond University might in some way be beholden to the University of Queensland. A much greater threat to Bond's independence is the proposal that the University of Queensland have members on Bond's council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The educational program at Bond is under the council's ultimate control. The University of Queensland's influential presence on that council, therefore, could profoundly affect Bond's program over the long term. Put simply, the argument is that the loss of diversity with the University of Queensland's bid for Bond is that the purchase of the campus by the University of Queensland and the elements of University of Queensland control will mean elimination of Bond University's private and independent essence. A distinctive element and an alternative style of undergraduate study for Australian students would therefore be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something different is happening at the Bond campus and it should be allowed to thrive and prosper in the national interest. The committee has, therefore, made two other recommendations. The committee recommends that, in the national interest, the purchase of the Bond University campus by the University of Queensland should not proceed. The committee also recommends that public universities should be disqualified from participating in any re-tendering or other future selling process for the Bond University campus. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by thanking very much the staff of the secretariat for their professionalism. They have to deal with quite improper inquiries which are held in an improper and, in my view, totally inappropriate way. As a consequence, they are placed in an intolerable position of, to a large measure, becoming essentially propagandists in terms of presenting material on behalf of senators which do not reflect the evidence. This stands in sharp contrast to the previous committee report which has just been presented, where very difficult matters were dealt with in an entirely different way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here today is yet another pernicious, failed Senate inquiry which is built fundamentally upon a lie. That lie is contained on the cover of this report, which refers, in its terms of reference, to the sale of the Bond University. There is no sale of the Bond University. This was supposed to be an inquiry into the sale of the real estate at Bond University&mdash;a very important difference. There are no public funds at risk in this episode. The only waste of public funds is involved in the operation of this Senate committee itself. In that regard it is my view and the view of Labor senators that this is an abuse of the privileges of this parliament and an abuse of the committee system of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned it demonstrates yet again the complete lack of moral leadership within the Liberal Party. It was once said that it was just a question of apathy and lethargy on behalf of the Liberal leadership that various senators could behave in the way they do in the Senate. What has occurred to me on this occasion is the direct involvement of the Liberal leadership in what I believe to be a totally inappropriate strategy to undo the University of Queensland bid. It is a strategy that does the Liberal leadership and the Liberal Party no credit whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the recommendations contained in the majority report are thoroughly predictable and are totally unsupported by the evidence. They are based on prejudice, presumption and, of course, on patronage. The so-called findings of the Liberal majority on this committee fly in the face of the facts, they fly in the face of the law and they fly in the face of political morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This grubby little inquiry is part of a concerted campaign to undermine the University of Queensland bid for the purchase of the Bond campus and adjoining land&mdash;some 450 hectares of prime real estate. Planning developments include eight hectares of high rise, 81 hectares of townhouses, 57 hectares of houses, as well as a research park and a commercial facility. And Liberal senators come in here in this pious and pompous manner and try to tell us this is a matter of national interest. What we have seen here is a process of political interference in negotiations between commercial bidders for the assets of a company that is in receivership. It is a totally inappropriate use of the Senate to do such a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole matter has been prejudged from the start, as was indicated when this whole inquiry was announced in the pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Senator Hill on 6 September. Further prejudging was quite clearly demonstrated on 15 November in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Senator Tierney, when he indicated he thought the allegations that had been made by witnesses were damning. What we have here is an example of a group of people within the university who have come together. The main players are Professor Carmichael, Professor Goldsworthy, Professor Corkery and Professor Farrar, in his role as Acting Vice-Chancellor following the resolution that was carried at Bond unanimously by the staff that Professor Messel be removed as the Vice-Chancellor. Professor Messel, of course, is now involved in his role as executive chancellor. I mention also Xavier Clarke and, of course, Terry Gygar, the chief of staff from the office of the Vice-Chancellor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group was brought together upon the calling of tenders by the receiver. The group's strategies were on a two-pronged basis. The first was to form a consortium with private investors, such as BHP and News Ltd, that would act to bring together a corporate base to coordinate a bid for the lands at Bond. This consortium was coordinated by Peter Laver, the Director of Corporate Relations at BHP. This group was later joined with the Council of Bond University to access some $20.2 million from accumulated funds to act as a deposit and enable them to borrow funds needed for the purchase of the university lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second phase of the inquiry was to destroy other bids by Queensland University, Monash University and Griffith University. To this end they issued a writ against the receivers and creditors, KPMG and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, to try to gain a lease and extract damages accordingly. It was very interesting to note that only last week EIE called in the $95 million debt as a result of some of their shenanigans in regard to the Supreme Court in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that the Bond contract with EIE was predicated on the assumption that that loan would become payable once a profit was declared by Bond University. This first occurred in the 1993-94 year when Bond posted a profit of $680,000. I understand that, as a result of that, Bond University Ltd was called upon to repay the loan, but has since ignored it. It can no longer ignore that call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bond University Ltd has made a profit of $6.7 million in the last year. As I say, only last Friday week a writ was issued against Bond University for the immediate payment of the $95 million subordinated debt. It is the irony of this strategy that it has backfired. BUL now faces the real prospect of receivership itself as a result of these quite wicked manoeuvres through this place and through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the strategy of the group was to frustrate the other bidders through trade practices action. This action was clearly undertaken to frustrate other bidders and failed yet again because the Trade Practices Commission came down against BUL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and most insidious move was political approaches through the Senate. To understand just what those links are one has to understand who forms the backbone of the consortium and their direct links to the Liberal Party. One member of staff at Bond University is Professor Ashley Goldsworthy, Dean of the School of Business. Professor Goldsworthy's role in this plan has been clearly to coordinate the political interference in the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is a former Liberal Party National President and is currently a member of the National Executive of the Liberal Party, as is Senator Robert Hill, the mover of the motion which referred the sale of Bond to the committee.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Professor Goldsworthy told a meeting of deans at Bond University that he, Professor Goldsworthy, had written the terms of reference moved by Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that, despite his prominent role, Professor Goldsworthy did not himself ever give evidence to this inquiry. But his involvement had been more indirect through the coordination of all other submissions through BUL. Another active participant has been Terry Gygar, Chief of Staff in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor of Bond. Mr Gygar is the former state Liberal Party member for Strafford in the Queensland parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the submissions we received was a letter to Professor Goldsworthy from a prominent business person, who was&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`writing in response to Professor Goldsworthy's letter of 30 October 1995'. There is no doubt, and Professor Goldsworthy indicates in his letter to the alumni:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been asked to coordinate the task of encouraging supportive submissions from as broad and diverse a base as possible for the Senate inquiry next week.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is no doubt in my mind. There has been an insidious orchestration of submissions and political interference in the sale process has occurred. I do not think it is appropriate that people should be sanctimonious about the weight of so-called findings based on these submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a clear collusion of interests in such a way as there has been interference in a commercial transaction. The evidence has been ignored by the majority report. There has been no evidence whatsoever that public funds have been involved. There has been quite clearly an inappropriate use of the Senate. In my view, it is totally and completely wrong for the Senate to be involved in a political interference of the proper and legal and prudential duties of the receivers in regard to the disposal of private assets of a company that is in receivership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly in terms of the Trade Practices Commission's findings, there is no direct competition between Bond University Ltd and the University of Queensland. In my judgment, this inquiry has been an inappropriate use of the Senate. It is a totally morally bankrupt approach to politics in this country for the Senate to interfere in private commercial proceedings, which of course involve matters before the Supreme Court, and impinge upon the proper legal corporate law and the proper prudential responsibilities of receivers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before speaking to the report, I want to particularly thank the committee secretariat&mdash;our secretary, Rob Diamond, and researchers James Satrapa and Liz Williams&mdash;whose expertise and knowledge of modern technology in communications were invaluable in the writing of this report, which required a great degree of knowledge and involved a lot of technological terms. I congratulate them for the way they have reduced these technological terms so that the report has become more readable for members of the community who are interested in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank my colleagues on the committee, particularly the committee's deputy chairman, Bruce Childs, for their efforts in once again enabling our committee to table a unanimous report. It is some 18 months since the committee commenced this inquiry, and at that time two other major inquiries were being untaken. In this inquiry we considered the outcomes of these reports in making our own determinations. Our committee also completed two other urgent major inquiries while the telecommunications reference was being dealt with. It is intended that this report be distributed on the Internet, which is our contribution to the technological advances in communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is intended to reflect public debate about Australia's future communications requirements and how we are best able to meet those requirements now and in the future. The committee has tried to focus, however, not so much on the technology but on the people who will use it. This is a report about people and about the impact technology is having on society. We are becoming a different society as computers and advanced technology make their way into everyday use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's wide-ranging terms of reference cover the technological developments that will allow for better opportunities for communication. The terms of reference also address the consequences for Australian consumers and industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the possibilities of new communications are exciting, the committee quickly became aware that they will not be shared equally by all Australians. The committee has therefore paid particular attention to the needs of rural and remote communities, low income earners and the elderly to see whether their communication needs are being met. The committee considers it very important for public sector programs to coordinate their activities if they are to properly benefit the Australian community. The committee was also interested in the possibilities for work and the potential for industry in a new communications environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is sufficiently concerned about the privacy implications arising from the use of converged communications technology to recommend extending the Privacy Act to the private sector. The committee is also concerned that the failure to address the security of electronic transactions could adversely affect Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is keen to ensure that advances in information technology and telecommunications will not widen the gap between the information rich and the information poor. It therefore emphatically recommends that our diverse communities are able to actively involve themselves in designing their own communications environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other infrastructures, our future communications networks will serve as a framework to support social interaction, education, health, government services, business activities, recreation and our communication with the rest of the world. By neutralising the tyranny of distance, our future communications networks may even be the key to reversing the long slow population decline which has been affecting so many of our rural communities. I quote only one small part of our report which reports on a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The death of distance as a determinant of the cost of communications will probably be the single most important economic force shaping society in the first half of the next century. The cost of using services may be determined on other criteria such as the speed and capacity of the line. How those effects will translate into benefits for customers in rural and remote Australia is yet to be seen, but a commitment from government and carriers to maintain the process of reducing costs is vital.</PARA>
<PARA>Many in the community are looking to government and to their elected representatives to play a leadership role in the new information and technology environment. The committee sees a continuing role for government as an information provider, a builder of infrastructure and a partner in industry development. There is also a role for government in ensuring that social objectives are met, that distribution of technology is fair and equitable, that it is affordable, that it is private and secure, that it reflects community needs and that the great majority of Australians can use new technology easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of this report is important. General policy frameworks are in place, industry is well on track to repeat and indeed improve investment returns and major telecommunication reviews are now complete. The committee's recommendations will provide the basis for some important adjustments and finetuning at an earlier rather than later stage. Once again I particularly thank the members of the secretariat, who are here in the chamber for the tabling of this report, for the work they have done over a long period, and a very intense period, too, in getting this report tabled. I once again thank them on behalf of the committee and I commend this report to all senators. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations in this report, if adopted by the Government, would result in the most significant changes to financial reporting for the Commonwealth since Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this report, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts maintains the momentum for moving the Commonwealth away from its outdated cash accounting system into the accrual accounting culture. Australian business, of course, has long operated in the accrual accounting environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they are incurred, irrespective of whether cash is paid or received. Accrual accounts for government departments would include depreciation on assets, employee entitlements such as long service leave and the value of goods and services received free from the Commonwealth or other bodies. Accrual information better reflects the true cost of providing services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Bureau of Statistics advised the Committee that, by the turn of the century, the International Monetary Fund will be requiring accrual based information from statistically advanced nations. The recommendations in Report 341, if adopted, would ensure that Australia is well placed to meet international requirements for accrual information on the financial position of the Commonwealth by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, the then Minister for Finance, the Hon Ralph Willis MP, announced that the financial reporting framework for Commonwealth agencies would be recast to reflect accrual accounting concepts. For the 1994-95 financial year, all government budget-sector agencies have submitted annual financial statements on an accrual basis&mdash;most for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this is just the first step!  Government agencies cannot be expected to take accrual accounting and reporting seriously if they are still required to budget on a cash basis and continue to be funded by cash appropriations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge now is to move Commonwealth financial management&mdash;including the Commonwealth Budget cycle&mdash;into the accrual environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee takes up the challenge in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Building on the recommendations contained in its Report 338, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accrual Accounting&mdash;A Cultural Change</EMPHASIS>, the Committee proposes in Report 341 that the accrual reports of government agencies&mdash;including government business enterprises&mdash;should be consolidated into an accrual based whole of government report for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To comprehend the significance of whole of government reports it is important to understand what they are. Quite simply whole of government reports are the financial statements of the government as a single entity. They are derived from consolidating the accrual based financial statements of individual agencies which collectively represent the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whole of government reports would show, among other things, the total revenues and expenses of government operations, the value of assets available to the government and the total obligations of the government, in a concise and easily readable format. This information is not currently prepared on an accrual basis for the government as a single entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whole of government reporting for the Commonwealth will make the financial position of the Commonwealth more transparent. In particular, since whole of government reports will reveal the Commonwealth's assets and liabilities&mdash;and not just cash flows&mdash;it will be immediately apparent if the government of the day is running down the asset base of the Commonwealth to fund recurrent spending, to the cost of future generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Report 341 the Committee also makes recommendations which give guidance on contentious technical issues that will need to be sorted out before whole of government reporting can be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 341 proposes the preparation of audited whole of government reports for the 1997-98 financial year. Leading up to this it is proposed that the key agencies, the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office, develop a model and perform trials for the consolidation process. I understand that this action has already begun. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the preparation of whole of government reports  is not the final stage in the transition from a cash to an accrual culture. There is little point in preparing the latest and greatest financial reports for the Commonwealth unless there is also a mechanism for feeding this information  into financial planning and, ultimately, into the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commonwealth produces excellent whole of government reports that sit on the shelf, then the whole exercise will have been a horrendous waste of administrative resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this report, the Committee proposes a financial reporting framework that ties the Budget process into the accrual environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment, the form and content of the Budget Papers is at the discretion of governments and their advisers and there are no plans to move the Budget process away from cash reporting. If the Government ignores the recommendations in Report 341, the media and the community will continue to focus undue attention on the cash deficit or surplus. As one American economist has pointed out, the budget deficit is `a number in search of a concept'. Evidence to the Committee's inquiry into fiscal responsibility legislation pointed out that cash aggregates such as the budget deficit or surplus have little meaning and are not sensible fiscal policy targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is just not sensible for the Commonwealth Budget cycle to continue on a cash basis once government agencies have moved to accrual reporting and once the Commonwealth itself has started to publish accrual based whole of government reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been enough confusion about the Commonwealth's financial position when all the Commonwealth's financial reports have been prepared on the same basis. The prospect of having the Department of Finance publish a set of accrual numbers for the Commonwealth and the Treasury publishing another set of cash numbers for the Commonwealth&mdash;and the public trying to understand why the numbers don't add up&mdash;is clearly one to be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Report 341, the Committee recommends that budget appropriations, forward estimates and the Budget process itself should move into the accrual accounting environment by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's view, it is important that the Parliament plays a key role in determining the form and content of financial reports tabled. After all, such reports are prepared principally for Parliament's use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committee also recommends that the Government introduce legislation to be called the Fiscal Reporting Act  in which Parliament  can determine the type of financial reports to be presented by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fiscal Reporting Act&mdash;as envisaged by the Committee in Report 341&mdash;would formalise the tabling of the Budget Papers, the Treasurer's Mid-year Review and the Actual Budget Outcome. The Committee recommends the preparation of two additional Budget cycle reports:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a pre-budget fiscal strategy statement (to be tabled three months prior to the Budget); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a `user-friendly' condensed version of the Budget Papers that would be easily understood by the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But more importantly, the Fiscal Reporting Act would be the vehicle by which the Parliament could require the Budget cycle reports to be prepared as accrual based whole of government reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also examined the possibility of enhanced Parliamentary scrutiny of the Commonwealth's financial reports. At the moment, Parliamentary committees examine the financial performance of government departments and agencies&mdash;but not the Commonwealth as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that whole of government reports produced by the Department of Finance should stand referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Committee also recommends that the Budget Papers should stand referred to a parliamentary committee to be established for this purpose under the proposed Fiscal Reporting Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, by heeding the recommendations in this report, the Government has an opportunity to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of the international trend to accrual reporting for governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in relation to international financial reporting practice, the Committee was fortunate to be briefed at length by experts from Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America. I would like to place on the record the Committee's appreciation of the special assistance we received from officers of these jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also on behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those who contributed to the financial reporting inquiries by making written submissions or giving evidence at public hearings. I would especially like to thank the observers for these inquiries&mdash;George Carter from the Department of Finance and Lynne O'Brien from the Australian National Audit Office, and, as always, the Secretariat.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 342 is the result of the Committee's inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for Specific Purpose Payments held between 1994 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central feature of Australia's federal fiscal arrangements is the flow of Commonwealth financial assistance to state and local governments. As you will know, Commonwealth financial assistance to the states is divided into two categories: Specific Purpose Payments, or SPPs, and General Purpose Payments. In 1995-96, the Commonwealth paid out approximately $18.3 billion in accordance with the 90 odd SPP agreements between the Commonwealth and the state governments, local governments, universities and non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the striking features about these SPPs is their diversity. They range in value from programs with a Commonwealth contribution of less than half a million dollars per annum to those with Commonwealth contributions of over $3 billion per annum; and from one off grants to 10 year programs. Administrative structures and arrangements also vary greatly, depending on the size and complexity of the program and the degree of involvement by the Commonwealth government, other levels of government and non-government agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last decade, reviews at the Commonwealth and state level have highlighted considerable potential for improvements in the administration and structure of SPPs and in the effectiveness and efficiency with which SPP funded services are delivered to the public. The weight of evidence prompted the JCPA to establish its own inquiry, which has culminated in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA made an early decision to confine its inquiry to the administration of SPPs and avoid entering debate on the appropriate balance of SPP and GPP payments to the states or the merits of individual SPP objectives. These issues are matters of policy and are well canvassed at the regular Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and Commonwealth-state ministerial meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite arguments to the contrary from some state governments, the Committee believes that SPPs are a legitimate vehicle for ensuring that Commonwealth policies and priorities are implemented, even if this is done by complementing or `topping up' existing state government services. As such, the Commonwealth should have the primary responsibility for setting the broad policy and national objectives for SPPs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes, however, that the Commonwealth should shift its focus from the micro-management of SPPs and leave state governments with greater responsibility for service delivery planning. The trade off for granting the states greater autonomy in service delivery planning is that the Commonwealth will place a correspondingly greater emphasis on measuring service delivery performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee became concerned that too few SPP agreements clearly articulate what the SPPs are designed to achieve, in terms of impact on the community. The result is often a continuing preoccupation with the activity associated with SPPs, rather than with the results of the activity. The Committee has recommended that all SPPs should have concise statements of what the SPP is trying to achieve, expressed in terms of measurable outcomes. Associated performance indicators should also be specified in SPP agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Correspondingly, and importantly, state governments and other parties receiving SPP funds should be held accountable for their performance towards meeting program objectives, or what they achieve, rather than so much on how they achieve the objectives. However, the Committee believes that input controls such as maintenance of effort clauses, matched funding agreements and caps on the proportion of funds that can be spent on administration should not be phased out of SPP agreements before performance agreements are phased in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, most SPP agreements will need a more sophisticated framework of sanctions in place for non-compliance with the terms of SPP agreements before the Commonwealth can give full responsibility for service delivery planning to states. Such sanctions might include a temporary return to a greater Commonwealth involvement in service delivery planning and oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the continuous collection and assessment of performance data should be the main way of measuring SPP performance, the Committee believes it important for SPP administrators to be subject to external scrutiny by independent evaluators. The Auditor-General is the Commonwealth's major external reviewer and has a mandate to conduct performance audits of public sector entities and programs. However, the mandate does not extend to allowing the Auditor-General to evaluate the performance of the state agencies also involved in administering SPPs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Commonwealth Auditor-General has argued that Commonwealth Auditors-General should be able to conduct holistic performance audits that `follow the Commonwealth dollar through'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such audits would best be performed by Commonwealth and state Auditors-General conducting the audits with joint teams. There is the practical difficulty, however, that not all state Auditors-General have the same performance audit mandates. The Committee believes that the ultimate goal should be uniform audit legislation in all Australian jurisdictions. A less ambitious, but more achievable goal, which the Committee has recommended, is that all audit legislation be harmonised to allow Auditors-General to conduct joint performance audits of SPPs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short term, the Committee sees greater potential for coordinated audits between the Commonwealth Auditor-General and those state Auditors-General who have a mandate to conduct performance audits. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Auditor-General investigate the possibility of conducting coordinated performance audits of SPPs with state Auditors-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Committee has recommended major changes in the way that the Commonwealth acquits the many hundreds of millions of dollars that it provides to the state governments, universities and non-government schools each year as part of SPP agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me state at the outset, the Committee believes that it is fundamental for the Commonwealth to be assured that SPP funds are spent on the basis on which they were allocated. However, the Committee believes that it is possible to streamline SPP financial accountability mechanisms and still allow a full acquittal of SPP funds. In essence, the Committee believes that the Commonwealth should be satisfied with the audited and appropriately annotated annual financial statements of SPP fund recipients for SPP acquittal processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advantages of this model are numerous. The agency receiving SPP funding does not have to prepare separate accounts for the Commonwealth, the audit task is not duplicated and the Commonwealth can be assured that the statements will be prepared promptly. There will thus be a savings in time, effort and costs and one set of documents that satisfy the financial accountability requirements of all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a related matter, the Committee has recommended that Commonwealth departments administering SPPs should liaise with the Department of Finance to determine whether SPP payments are being made on an optimal schedule and dates to minimise the Commonwealth's recourse to short term borrowing. Such a recommendation has the potential to save the Commonwealth considerable sums of money, as badly timed transfers can place pressure on the Commonwealth's cash holdings and contribute to the need for short term borrowings to cover any cash shortfalls. This recommendation compliments recommendations made in an earlier report by the Committee&mdash;Report 340, concerning cash management in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Committee believes that it is important that both the public and service deliverers are aware of the Commonwealth's financial contribution to the delivery of SPP funded services. In the Committee's experience it is all too easy for the Commonwealth's contribution to joint Commonwealth-state programs to be ignored. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that all SPP agreements should include arrangements to ensure that the Commonwealth's contribution is recognised in application documentation, approval announcements, media releases, official openings and other program publicity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges that implementation of some of its recommendations will not be easy, particularly for the large, ongoing SPPs in the health, education and community services areas. Reforms will be gradual, not just because of the difficulties in measuring outcomes and performance, but also because of the impossibility of quickly reorganising complex systems without service delivery suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the practical difficulties, it is important that the momentum for reform continues, particularly as the political will to do so exists. The Committee believes that its recommendations, if adopted, will ensure that the momentum is not lost and that SPP administration and accountability, as a whole is improved. Most importantly, those individuals or groups in the community who receive SPP funded services, of what ever form, should receive more efficient and effective service, delivered in the most economical way possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to express the Committee's thanks to those people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearing. I would also like to thank the staff of the Secretariat for assisting the Committee in preparing the Report. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The tabling speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February this year it was announced that the JCPA would be keeping a watching brief on the work of the Tax Law Improvement Project&mdash;this report is the first tabled as a result of that brief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tax Law Improvement Project is engaged in the task of completely rewriting Australia's income tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a task of national significance and one which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts supports. Indeed the Improvement Project was established in response to one of the recommendations in the Committee's Report 326, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Assessment of Tax</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in Parliament in November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 343, contains the Committee's comments on evidence taken at a public hearing held in October this year. At this hearing 17 witnesses from government, from tax and accounting bodies, and from academia were invited to give their views on a range of issues relating to tax law improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our intention in presenting this report is not to call into question the work of the Improvement Project, much of which has been strongly supported in the Parliament and the wider community. Rather, our interest is to ensure that the opportunities we now have to reform our tax law come to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main themes which emerged at our hearing and which are reflected in the report. These are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the scope of the terms of reference for the Improvement Project;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the way in which the rewritten law should be delivered to Parliament and implemented; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need for a separate forum to examine matters of tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to touch briefly on each of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been said that the capacity of the Improvement Project to produce simplified tax law is limited by its inability to examine and propose changes to tax policy. Since the beginning its mandate has been to re-express, in simpler language, the law as it currently stands&mdash;not to review current tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After weighing the evidence, the Committee believes that the mandate of the Improvement Project is appropriate. To encumber the Project with a broader responsibility at this stage would jeopardise the chances of producing better tax law within the sort of timeframe set for the Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second main theme discussed at the hearing was the delivery schedule for the rewritten legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project Team is proposing to deliver the new law to Parliament progressively, as it is drafted, and to seek progressive implementation, with each instalment of the rewritten law commencing for the income year beginning after Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An alternative view, which has some currency within the tax industry, is that a deferred commencement date should be set for the rewritten law at the completion of the Project&mdash;the so called `big bang' approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are valid arguments in favour of both approaches, but on balance the Committee considers that progressive implementation of the rewritten legislation is a better option than deferring commencement of the legislation until the conclusion of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final and most contentious issue emerging from the hearing was in relation to the need for a separate forum to consider tax policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence we received indicated widespread frustration in the tax and business communities about the way in which tax policy has evolved and is debated in Australia. This frustration generated a number or views about the need for an alternative tax policy forum, about how such a forum might be constituted and about what such a forum might consider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Committee is sympathetic to the concerns underpinning these views, in the end, the Committee does not support the calls for a new external forum for the development of tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of tax policy is, and will always remain, a government's prerogative. The Treasury is rightly the focus of tax policy development in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to say that Treasury always gets it right, nor that tax policy should be determined in a vacuum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We received evidence which was strongly critical of the way in which Treasury deals with stakeholders in the tax system. It seems to the Committee that Treasury could improve its performance in this area by adopting the sort of open and inclusive consultative processes used by the Improvement Project in its work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even though we believe Treasury is the appropriate body to convene and direct any consideration of the strategic direction of tax policy, there is a legitimate role for Parliament to play in ensuring that issues emerging from the work of the Improvement Project are given close consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the Committee intends to continue its watching brief in the area of tax law improvement. While I expect that most tax policy matters emerging from the Improvement Project would, in the normal course of events, be taken up by Treasury and the ATO, the Committee will follow up any significant matters which appear not to be receiving appropriate attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, opportunities for reform are rare and it is important that the momentum for change initiated by the establishment of the Improvement Project is not only maintained, but built upon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Improvement Project shows every sign of achieving the objectives set for it. This is to the credit of all involved in the Project. I would like to particularly acknowledge the efforts of the Project Director, Brian Nolan, who is performing a difficult job with distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Committee agrees with those who have argued that the Improvement Project should be seen as the first step in a more ambitious reform of the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately a tax simplification program must focus on more than rewriting the Tax Act, it must seek to review tax policy and simplify both the full body of tax law, and the administrative systems underpinning the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This broader goal is the challenge which will confront governments over the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was adjourned last evening, I was talking about the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995 and what we feel is the ham-fisted attempt to target money to `those who need it most'&mdash;in the government's words&mdash;which is the government's usual justification. I had mentioned that the amendment the government is suggesting will not result in any increased fairness. It will only make people find more expensive rental accommodation so as to be able to access rental assistance and have slightly more money to meet their needs. Therefore, I had foreshadowed that we would be opposing schedule 7 of the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995 in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern with this bill is the amendment under schedule 2. That amendment takes 15-year-olds on special benefits allowance and moves them on to the youth training allowance. I would like to know what the difference is in the amount of each of these benefits. If the minister is not able to provide me with that, perhaps we can ask that further in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have concerns with schedules 1, 2 and 4 of the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 3) 1995. Schedule 1 is about extended deeming. It seems to be a fairly neutral change in itself. But there seems to be the incongruous situation where valuation of investments for the purpose of taking the interest as income can be different for two people with exactly the same investments; this can occur because they can be valued at different moments in time. Therefore, there is no certainty for people to know how much of their income will be lost in amounts of deemed income. Approximately 200,000 pensioners will have their rates reduced because of deemed income from their investments. I would like to know how many students and youth will be affected in this same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also question the amendment in schedule 2, which is to keep recipients of the youth training allowance who get sick for more than 13 weeks on that allowance, instead of transferring them to the sickness allowance. I would like to know what the difference in rates is between the two&mdash;if not at this stage, perhaps in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned my concerns at the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart into one, under schedule 4. I believe that it is important for the government to keep a rigorous collection of statistics of the success of case management based on the length of the person's unemployment. I do not believe that it should be easier for the government to lump all unemployed people together, as it may blur long-term unemployment issues and special management of long-term unemployed people in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definitions of paid work, the type of training that long-term unemployed people can receive, the different styles of paid work they can access from self-employment, collective, cooperative or community based work and voluntary work need to be reassessed by the government for long-term unemployed people. Much effort is expended trying to get long-term unemployed people back into the full-time work force, instead of dealing also with their changing needs and new ways of looking at the concepts of `leisure' and `work'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At another level, I am concerned that this amalgamation will lead to a further fudging of the statistics, blurring any true analysis of the success of case management. People working in this area would know of the number of questions I have asked as to how much the government can tell us about the success of case management; and the answer is that they can tell us very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting people into training for 13 to 16 weeks is sometimes of more benefit to a government who can claim that moving people from newstart to jobsearch allowance is solving the unemployment problem, rather than benefiting the people concerned. We need to deal with the unemployment problem by creating alternative definitions of work, looking at the needs of the whole person instead of seeing a person who is not in full-time work as idle, and targeting services with a flexibility that the current structure of case management does not permit but has the potential to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise here that this does not mean that we are saying case management is wrong. We are saying that the government needs to know what they are trying to achieve with case management and should actually be working on outcomes and putting their resources into outcomes rather than putting resources into the squeaky wheel. I urge the government to take this to task. I also foreshadow that we will be opposing schedule 4 of the youth training allowance bill No. 3. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing this debate I would like to thank the senators from all sides of the parliament who have contributed to it. The bills that are before the parliament and are to be addressed today are the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bills Nos 2 and 3 for 1995. As has already been discussed, these are mainly mechanical bills to reflect changes that have been considered and approved by the Senate over the last few days to the Social Security Act. This will ensure that the youth training allowance is similar in nature to other Commonwealth income support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I address the bills, I would like to make some response to some of the comments that have been made here in the chamber. I would like to state that during the time of this government the number of unemployed 15- to 19-year-olds has fallen substantially. It has fallen from a level of 150,000 when the government came to office in 1983 to now around 90,00, a drop of 40 per cent in teenage unemployment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course a lot of other things have happened over those 12 1/2 years as well. These days 15- to 19-year-olds are by and large not in the work force. They are at school or in TAFE training or higher education. Secondary participation has increased from around one in three going on to year 12 when the government came to office to three out of every four going on to year 12 now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth growth funding for the TAFE and training sector has also seen participation increase in that sector and the higher education undergraduate population has increased by over 50 per cent. These are indeed quite significant changes. This has happened because young people these days need additional skills to be able to enter the work force. The kinds of unskilled jobs that were available to 15- to 19-year-olds in the past, particularly the 15-year-old school leavers, have simply disappeared. To enter the work force in the 1990s young people require more than just a basic year 10 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to my government's achievements with apprenticeships and traineeships. The federal Labor government has been very successful during its period in office in seeing the labour force grow. The labour force has increased by around 25 per cent from some 6 1/2 million to around eight million. At the same time, the number of apprentices and trainees commencing has also increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note particularly that the opposition should be aware that when they left office apprenticeship and traineeship commencements were of the order of 35,000. In the last year they numbered some 70,000, so we have doubled the performance of the opposition, whereas the teenage population has increased by only a little over 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced a range of other measures, including Austudy, Working Nation's youth training initiative and the recently announced jobs pathway guarantee program. These initiatives are delivering more opportunities than ever before for young people to participate in education and training which will lead to full-time employment. The youth training initiative is particularly important for those young people who leave school, possibly before they complete their studies, and experience difficulty in finding work. The YTI, as it is called, provides individual assistance through case management to encourage young people in this situation to undertake full-time study or to participate in approved training and jobsearch activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the number of young people unemployed is still too many and is concentrated particularly in some regions. That is why the government has adopted a structure of area consultative committees, along with the case managers regime, to ensure that the attack on unemployment, particularly on youth unemployment, is concentrated on those regions where greatest assistance is needed. In addition, 52 specialist youth liaison positions have been established and placed in the Department of Employment, Education and Training regions with the highest youth need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there is an amendment to the motion. The government opposes that amendment, on the grounds contained in the remarks I have just delivered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to schedule 7, as I mentioned, we have a situation where we are having the rent assistance threshold raised by $5. Our arguments are that the administrative costs will virtually eat up all but $5 million of the proposed revenue over a period of several years, and basically it will make a number of people worse off. The logic of it totally escapes us. Therefore, on behalf of the Greens, I do not intend to support it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In support of Senator Margetts's position, we have noticed that historically when this sort of thing happens&mdash;and it need not be necessarily restricted to rent assistance&mdash;it is possible to expect that the persons who would be most advantaged after a very short period of time would be those who are renting out the properties. The increase seems to have been made with the intention of supporting those who are renting properties, but the landlords are more likely to be the ones who gain because their capacity to pass on that increase is not restricted in any way by what is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With it being very clear that further assistance is available, if an increase in the rent is brought about fairly quickly, the renters are not the people who gain the advantage. I would have thought that might have been obvious to the government in proposing this. With what Senator Margetts has reminded us of&mdash;the administrative costs and the other arrangements&mdash;it is hard to see how renting people are to be advantaged at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I foreshadowed in my speech on the second reading, there are also some other questions I would like to ask. There were some other things happening at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, Senator Margetts asked about schedule 2 of bill No. 2&mdash;that is, 15-year-olds who will be eligible for the youth training allowance immediately rather than having to transfer from special benefit after 13 weeks. I think that was the nub of the issue. The senator also asked why young people who were sick would no longer transfer to sickness allowance for short periods of, say, up to 13 weeks. Again, this is to assist young people so they do not need to administratively transfer between allowances and they retain access to the full range of assistance available to the unemployed. Neither of these changes will affect the level of payments. That is my advice in terms of your question, Senator Margetts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In like fashion, because of my intention to oppose schedule 4 in relation to amalgamating jobsearch and newstart, I would ask that the chamber first of all deal with schedule 4 and then with the rest of the bill. In schedule 4 we believe the government is trying to cover up who is long-term unemployed and who is short-term unemployed. Case management schemes have been a cover-up. There has also been the pretence of jobs cloaked in the guise of training, which moves the long-term unemployed for a period of 16 weeks into either training or subsidised employment which takes them off newstart long enough for them to get back onto jobsearch when they return to unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This then skews the unemployment statistics and makes it look like the long-term unemployed are being helped. This then leaves the system open for creaming off the work ready, who are going to be picked up by the labour market anyway.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these bills, parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1995-96 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional appropriations in these three bills total some $1,415 million; $836 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $576 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and $3 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1995-96. Reflecting the government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, these savings, amounting to $499 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document "Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations", which has been distributed to honourable Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $916 million in appropriations for 1995-96, an increase of about two and a half per cent on the amounts made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the 1995-96 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the main areas for which the government seeks additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Running costs appropriations provide for the recurrent and minor capital costs of agencies in providing government services. The total supplementation for running costs for all departments and agencies (including Defence military and civilian personnel) of $433 million represents an increase of 3.5 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of factors contribute to this increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the initial budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, it is not practice to appropriate these amounts at budget time. Funds, comprising more than 60% of the total increase in running costs now being sought, are required to meet increases resulting from enterprise agreements (including the `foldback' arrangements) and other salary increases. Other major factors affecting running costs estimates include the impact of actual compared with estimated carryovers from 1994-95, borrowings against the forward estimates, and some additional funding for departments associated with workload changes provided for under the running costs arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gross additional estimates of some $187 million are sought for the Defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). This figure includes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$103 million for running costs, largely to meet increases associated with the second foldback under the APS Workplace Bargaining Agreement 1992-94 and the 1995-96 APS Enterprise Agreement;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$25 million for Voyager compensation, including some slippage in payments initially expected to be made in  1994-95;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$46 million for Defence facilities, largely attributable to an increased provision for reconfiguration of Russell Offices Building N annex, Salisbury redevelopment, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> modernisation, Duntroon redevelopment and the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$5 million for an operating subsidy for Aerospace Technologies of Australia Aircraft Services Proprietary Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increases have been partly offset by reductions elsewhere in the Defence appropriations, giving a net increase of some $117 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes provision for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a $22 million grant to the Sydney City Council for the restoration of the Sydney Customs House, reflecting a carryover of unspent funds from 1994-95;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$24 million for the care of veterans in non-departmental institutions, reflecting revised estimates based on the full-year experience in 1994-95&mdash;particularly for the care of veterans within the private hospital system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$28 million for the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, largely associated with an increase in the payments for the contracted case managers;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a further $22 million for the Department of Administrative Services' career transition program reflecting a further downsizing of the Asset Services and Australian Construction Services programs; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$39 million to Australian National for redundancy arrangements associated with the restructure of Australian National following the establishment of the National Rail Corporation, together with supplementation for a cashflow shortfall arising from anticipated implementation of the preferred track access pricing model.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of some $184 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional appropriations are required to meet undertakings made by the government since the Budget, as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other economic parameter changes, including prices, since the Budget was prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1995-96</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1995-96, appropriations totalling $576 million&mdash;additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1995-96&mdash;are sought for capital works and services; payments to or for the states, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; advances and loans; and for other services. The proposed appropriations are required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in the Budget appropriation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additions are necessitated by certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1995-96 include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a $322 million payment to Qantas under the indemnity granted in respect of disputed withholding tax on certain aircraft financing transactions, in accordance with the arrangements disclosed in the Qantas sale prospectus;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$20 million for the supported accommodation assistance program, principally reflecting a carryover from 1994-95 following a delay by NSW in signing a new contract with the commonwealth until after 30 June 1995;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a $5 million payment to the Northern Territory for the provision of water and sewerage facilities for indigenous communities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$6 million for co-ordinated care trials for people with on-going and complex health needs, in accordance with the decision of the Council of Australian Governments;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$25 million for computer equipment for the Department of Social Security largely as a consequence of bringing forward expenditure from future years to address its IT System requirements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a $7 million payment to New South Wales towards the infrastructure costs associated with the establishment of the Fox Film Studios at the Sydney Showground site, as foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's Cultural Statement in October 1994;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$25 million for New South Wales for the development of the new Royal Agricultural Society site at Homebush;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$69 million for a loan for a two year period to Papua New Guinea in the context of economic stabilisation and general reforms under the auspices of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining $97 million included in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) comprises minor increases in a number of programs across a range of portfolios.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the government's motion and we continue to support the position that we advocated in the chamber here a few days ago which was designed to benefit Australian students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two principal matters involved in this debate. The first is the government's attempt to force an accelerated repayment of HECS upon existing and past students. We estimate&mdash;in fact, we have had the advantage of the government figures in this regard, so I can say that they estimate&mdash;that potentially some 800,000 Australian students are affected by the government's proposed change. It seeks to change the rules on students in relation to repayment of a HECS debt without the approval of those students. We argued in this place that that was unfair and, therefore, that it should be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the history of this government has been that it seeks to change the rules on students in relation to HECS, it seeks to lower the threshold and it seeks to force earlier repayment. It is not surprising that Australian students have become disillusioned about these continual breaches of promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see no reason why we should back down on this. It is really just akin to another tax. Students entered into a compact with government whereby, in undertaking higher education, they agreed to accept the burden of part of the cost of that higher education, which becomes a debt&mdash;the higher contribution debt&mdash;and they agreed to repay that debt on certain terms and conditions. The government should not then subsequently seek through legislation to change the rules to unilaterally and retrospectively change the student obligations. We have stood by Australian students, both existing and past students, in this debate and against the government's attempt to disadvantage them in this way, and we continue to stand on that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue related to the government's attempt to change the eligibility rule for HECS from permanent residence to citizenship. Again, we said this was unfair as it applied to those current permanent residents in Australia. It is much the same principle, but in this case when you enter Australia on certain terms and conditions we could not see why those terms and conditions, as they applied to the benefit of a HECS funded education, should not be changed unilaterally. We see no reason to depart from that position either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to future students, we think a different situation applies. We can argue about what is the appropriate level of HECS repayment of HECS debt or the terms of repayment for future students. Although we may in this instance have different views from that of the government, nevertheless, we think there is a different principle when future students decide to accept the offer of substantial publicly funded higher education on different terms and conditions from the past. Students either accept the offer of support from government or they do not. That is why we think that is fundamentally different from seeking to change the rules on students who have already been educated or are being educated on certain terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we think the same principle applies in relation to those entering this country. If they enter this country knowing that HECS eligibility is based on citizenship rather than permanent residency, that is the basis upon which they take the HECS opportunity. It is fundamentally different from those who have entered on different terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about very large sums of money in this instance. I understand that in relation to the accelerated repayment of HECS for next year we are talking of a figure just over $8 million. That is $8 million when we look at the public contribution to higher education of around $5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would not have thought the Senate's decision to stand by students in this instance could therefore logically have any effect upon the government's capacity to fund higher education overall. It obviously has no relevance at all. Unfortunately, Minister Crean has entered upon a path of political blackmail in that he has said unless the Senate passes this bill and inflicts this extra burden on existing and past students, he will refuse to fund additional places that are necessary in higher education. The interesting thing is that this government had already made the promise of those additional places. </PARA>

The minister might like to table Minister Crean's press release of 17 May and he will see that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government took the kudos and finally acknowledged it was undersupplying places to areas of population growth in Australia&mdash;in particular, Queensland, Western Australia and a small number of places in northern Tasmania. These were areas that had been disadvantaged relative to the rest of Australia. I remind you, Madam Temporary Chairman, that we have been calling for the provision of those places for a long time. Finally, the government determined it would meet that public obligation and announced those places. It attached no conditions to that whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have this exercise of political blackmail whereby the minister now finds it politically convenient to argue that unless the Senate in effect charges existing students more, that allows the government to legitimately break its promise to future students to provide them with the places that are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an appalling argument. To try to, in effect, set existing and past students against future students and to seek to tell future students they are going to be penalised unless present and past students accelerate the repayment of their HECS debt is an appalling abuse of Australian students. The minister should be ashamed of the grubby political tactic that he has engaged in in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure for next year, as I said, is just over $8 million. The government will gross it up over a period of years, but we are talking about places that are to be provided next year. In the case of Queensland, it is an extra 2,000 places. An amount of $8 million will come in from the HECS contribution if this bill were passed in the form that the government wishes. Really, it is not a large sum of money in relation to the provision of extra places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government has realised all of a sudden that Queensland is too politically sensitive, it has now changed its position from that which it was threatening in the lead-up to last weekend and during last weekend, which is that it would cut Queensland places. It has now, as I understand it&mdash;and Senator Cook will no doubt confirm this&mdash;decided it will not cut Queensland places. The latest threat from Minister Crean which he put out to the press yesterday was to provide the places in Queensland and instead to cut them from South Australia and Victoria. That is equally appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it is appalling is not only that it breaks another promise to South Australia and Victoria, but also there is a significant unmet demand in the southern states. In fact, Victoria has the highest unmet demand in Australia. There has been an historically high participation rate but there is still a very high unmet demand. So not only is this government not going to meet an obligation in relation to that unmet demand, but also it is going to worsen the situation by reducing the number of places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, you will remember that, when the government made its promise in the budget to Queensland, it said that future expected places, the so-called pipeline places, in Victoria would be abandoned. That was bad enough in itself, but it is now going further and threatening to withdraw a further 4,000 university places from Victoria&mdash;another exercise in political blackmail. Queensland is too difficult because the government has a whole series of seats that are threatened at the next election in Queensland. So let us quarantine Queensland and take the pain out on the southern states of Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government may not understand that, due to the incompetence of previous state Labor governments in particular, both South Australia and Victoria were practically bankrupted. We now have Liberal and coalition governments in those states trying to rebuild the economies in ways that produce more high value added jobs. The success of that economic strategy initiative is very dependent upon the higher education sector in South Australia and Victoria educating enough graduates to contribute to the economic restructuring and, therefore, the rebuilding of wealth in both South Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So not only is it a breach of promise to South Australians and Victorians but it would significantly undermine the capacity of those states to reinvigorate and rebuild their economies. It is hard to imagine anything this government could do that would be more counterproductive to the interests of the populations of South Australia and Victoria than what it is threatening to do in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect what will happen&mdash;and we got a hint of this from Minister Crean last week as well&mdash;is that the minister will decide it is too politically difficult to cut places from South Australia and Victoria, so he will move to his third phase of the political blackmail strategy and that will be to threaten to withdraw research funding from the universities. In an interview on Brisbane radio last Friday he said that was another option that was open to him. The minister has been, I understand, communicating with the universities now threatening to do this in order that they might apply greater pressure on us to change our position and to endorse his requirement for earlier repayment of HECS by existing and past Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an appalling bit of politics all round. I reiterate that there is no relationship between the government's obligation to provide adequate university places in this country and to pay for them in the same way that it pays for all undergraduate university places. This bill does not refer to that at all. This bill is about other matters, such as the earlier repayment of HECS and changing the test from permanent residency to citizenship. There is nothing in this bill that links those two matters together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must stand firm on its promise on places. If it does not, the coalition certainly will and will fund them in the way that we fund all other places in Australia. At this last minute the government ought to recognise that it has no right to seek to change the rules on students in the way that it is seeking to do within this bill and withdraw its proposal which is so unfair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This chamber should insist on the opposition's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) which would grandfather the increases to HECS repayments, the lowering of HECS repayment thresholds and the reclassification in relation to Australian residents so that current students will not be affected. An incredible amount of codswallop has been talked about in the other place in relation to the changes that were made in this place. There was also the most appalling examples of divide and rule in an attempt to set one part of the university system against the other by saying that one group must be responsible for accepting cuts so that another group can get the funding that they need. I think that is atrocious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of years we have noticed levels of underspending in a number of government areas, and the disguised cuts would indicate that the government is clearly responsible for any decisions it made in spending or not spending. It is not this chamber's decision not to support funding for higher education places. There is clearly a need in terms of research. It is felt, as indicated, that at least a couple of hundred million dollars is needed to just keep up with what has happened in the depreciation in research. There is an implied threat that research might be the next to go, and that is appalling. That would not be a clever thing to do. Allowing that kind of education capital to go down will not save money in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the level of debate in the other place in relation to these measures is what happened when a letter was read out by the member for Adelaide, Ms Worth, from the Students Association of the University of Adelaide which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Crean</PARA>

I am just wondering about the level this debate went to in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the whole approach of setting one group of students against another and making them responsible for the government's proposals to cut funding in any way in higher education is disgraceful. It is time that senators stood up and said that it is not right. If the government is deciding to cut funding for extra places, that is their decision. The fact that there is not even more demand for places is largely due to the government making it a Hobson's choice for many students in relation to surviving through university. The fact that the government are even talking about decreasing in some areas the standards for acceptance in universities indicates that they may have gone too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, I think it is disgraceful. Senators are doing the right thing in relation to these amendments.

<PARA>Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a number of figures bandied about in relation to this. Minister Schacht was in the chamber the other day attempting to blind us with science and to convince us with some statistics. The statistics were never based on any contribution from the government which enabled us to recognise fact and reality; they seemed more to be statistics which were convenient and numbers which were becoming bigger as the minister's eyes grew wider. An attempt was made to find a number which would impress us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rely on the number which is directly related to how many students there are in this category and the percentage of increase that the government would propose to accelerate their debt repayment. The number mentioned by Senator Hill was probably closer to reality&mdash;and, in this first instance, that means around about $8 million to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that this is of great desperate need and that it is a number so important that students may be denied their opportunity to engage in tertiary education. I am impressed by the coincidence&mdash;it seems a strange coincidence to me, but it is a useful one to think about&mdash;that this number is very close to another number: $7 million. That number was used in quite a cavalier fashion without a lot of responsibility and thought attached to it. The government seemed to be quite ready to depart with $7 million to assist one of the world's richest men to engage in a speculative project and to help him spend some money on some sort of Disneyland project in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government can quite easily fund $7 million to help Rupert Murdoch in his latest project in Sydney, why is the government spending so much time and effort blustering and flustering about $8 million which may be denied them on behalf of an investment on Australia's future through Australia's tertiary education system? How can one number be of such huge consequence and another one get almost irrelevant attention?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have heard and seen in recent days in this place such a fuss made about the government's funding of legal challenges of one of its colleagues. The government is quite prepared to depart with taxpayers' money on the one hand, but it is being so mingy about directing money towards the recognised need to fund university places for Australia's students on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think these coincidences should be noted. I think the government should be condemned for trying to tag the rightful provision of student places for the benefit of the whole of Australia&mdash;because, after all, it is the whole of Australia which benefits greatly from any investment in our education system. It should be condemned for being so parsimonious in relation to recognising its rightful obligation to properly provide for Australia's education, yet being so cavalier with handing out money for other propositions which have a political expediency attached to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate finds itself in a situation where it has to be impressed by the threats of the minister, it has to suddenly change its mind and depart from the principles which the Senate has upheld or it has to insist on the amendments which were passed in the Senate. The government has not given in the chamber today any reason for the Senate to change its motion. It has offered no explanation for retracting its position. All we have seen over the past few days, before the government returned with the rejection we have before us, has only confirmed our position because no real reason has been attached to this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons put forward in the media and in the other place have had no principle attached to them. The expediency is a purely political one. There is no rationale attached to the reasons put forward. We have had a desperate plea to adopt this measure for the reason that the budget is limited. The coincidence that I mentioned questions that. We also heard the excuse that because places have been promised to Queensland university students they should be funded by other students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that this was a budget measure, announced at budget time. I remind the Senate that the Democrats stated their opposition at that time and issued press statements soon after. We had no reaction from the minister for some months. I think it was 21 September before I saw mention in the press of the minister being concerned about how this measure would affect plans to provide extra places. But since that time there has not been the degree of panic and threat that we have seen in the past few days. </PARA>

The government has only itself to blame for the degree of desperation we have seen today. There has been plenty of time to recognise the effect of our opposition to this proposal. There has been plenty of time to find other ways to meet the funding of those places. The government has come in here, flailed about, compiled figures and made excuses why this action should be taken retrospectively to the real action.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logical foundation of what everybody in this chamber has said is that you can spend money without raising it; that if you create new places you can fund them from some vague part of the budget. I am not particularly surprised by the Greens and the Australian Democrats because it is not entirely inconsistent for them to assume that, in economic management, you can spend without raising taxes and have outlays without getting income and without going into deficit. There has been a consistent threat in a number of their policies, put forward on a populist front appealing to sectional interests, to agree to every spending operation that comes along without having to fund them. Therefore, I am not surprised by their reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is absolutely shocking is an opposition, pretending to be a government and wanting to contest the polls while presenting its credentials to the people of Australia as being strong on economic management, which believes that we can spend money without raising it.

The opposition wants the places, but it will not raise the money. It somehow says, `Well, you go off and find the money.' And, after having punched several holes in our budget since May of this year, opposition members at macro-economic level then attack the government on the basis of: is the budget in surplus or deficit? At sectional interest level, they go around punching holes daily and without any fiscal rectitude or responsibility, appealing to populist sentiment that you can give places without funding them. Then we hear Mr Howard and Mr Costello saying, `Well, since we have knocked back these measures and those measures, the government can't bring down a balanced budget.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber has been used as a manipulation by parties rather than as a chamber of review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister spent some time trying to assert blame. It looked very much like somebody pointing with both hands in different directions, claiming, `It wasn't me, Your Honour. It wasn't me, Sir.' I think the electorate will recognise that this government has a responsibility which it is trying to avoid. It has a responsibility which it recognised by declaring that new university places would be made available, but to tie it to a particular group of people and say, `You students will pay for it' is to confuse an obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that we in this place want that to be done without any further revenue raising from any source at all is to entirely misrepresent our position. We are quite happy to consider a more appropriate tax regime. We are quite happy to recognise that it is the entire community which benefits from an investment in education and that, therefore, it is the entire community which should recognise its responsibility to fund it. But to assert that we come in here and do not want to consider those is based on no foundation whatsoever. The minister, in pointing his hands in all directions but at himself and saying, `You're to blame, not me,' is really conducting an exercise which will be recognised by the electorate for what it is: a desperate way of trying to fund it without being brave enough as a government to say, `Well, the community should pay for these extra places'&mdash;the entire community, not the student community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been our position all along. Our position has been that there should be no discrimination, that the ends do not justify the means in this case. The government has described the ends as being a wonderful situation where new university places can be funded and has said that that, therefore, justifies discrimination and justifies changing the rules, as Senator Hill said, without the approval of students&mdash;a unilateral movement by the government from a compact, bargain or agreement, whatever it might have been, that was made with students at the time as to how much contribution they would make, how they would make it and when they would make it. The government has made a unilateral alteration to that without the agreement of the other party to the compact, agreement or deal. That is not fair. It is not fair in our society. That is not how we do things in other areas. That is not how people understand agreements to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government chooses to do that and say that because the ends are desirable, because it is desirable that we have extra places, that justifies this unfair strategy, then let the government be judged on that, because I contend that the ends do not justify the means. It is almost as good as saying, `We are going to put a GST on food for blue-eyed children only and all the others will be free from it. We will discriminate in certain areas because we are going to do something good with the money that we get from it.' I just cannot understand how a government from this perspective can propose such unfair and discriminatory practices as this accelerated HECS repayment and this discriminatory residents versus citizens debate. It would be a different matter if we had a society which was based on such a foundation, but we do not. It does not apply to the other activities of government, to the other obligations of government, so why should it apply here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, of course, contended in the past that the whole HECS scheme itself is in contravention of our international obligations to not charge fees for education. I have in the past indicated that I would seek avenues to challenge the whole basis of HECS. I am indebted to Mr Dudley Kavanagh, a law graduate in Tasmania, who has done a considerable amount of research in this matter. I know that this is neither the time nor the place to pursue it, but when I am able to devote some more time and attention to this, I intend to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been our position all along. We challenge the fundamental idea that university places should rely upon this scheme. That does not alter our capacity to recognise that it exists at the moment and at the moment what exists should be pursued and should continue to apply in the fairest possible way. Whenever we are confronted with an unfair change proposed by the government, we reserve the right to challenge that, notwithstanding that we disagree with the whole deal anyway. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Bell, this is not about discussing tax regimes or anything else. That is another debate for another time. HECS is with us and what the minister is doing is introducing some improvements as well as a slightly increased rate of return of HECS but not with any jeopardy of the basic level of AWE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to know that both NUS and CAPA have found, in consultation, that those increased rates are acceptable because they are very progressive. It is hitting people at the top end who are much better able to return those HECS charges than the people who come in on AWE. That is very important. The minister made that clear in his press release&mdash;the one so conveniently tabled by Senator Hill&mdash;that retaining the first compulsory repayment threshold at average weekly earnings persists. The government is determined to make that the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the arguments that have been used in here have been trawled across by Senator Cook, and I will not put them again. But there is clearly a misrepresentation of what the minister's position was. He has made it clear all along that if the dollars are not there it does put in jeopardy the possibility of expanding those places. That is quite clear. To say that was not made clear is to very much misrepresent what the minister had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill wanted to say that the word `improvement' is hardly fair to describe the changes in HECS. The students see it as certainly an improvement. There is a possibility of earlier repayments and voluntary repayments. These are changes in flexibility of the repayment of HECS that are, at least according to the people having to repay it, beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to recognise, Senator Bell, that not everybody goes to university. If you have a look at who still gets access to university, it is very much a section of the community which in the past we would have called privileged. Although we have expanded very much the number of people who do have access to our universities through our special programs and targeted ways of assisting people not usually expecting to go to university to have access, still and all you would have to say the majority of people who go to our universities are people who will then have the benefits of that education and very often access to assistance through their primary and secondary schooling that is not available to all families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the schedule of fees&mdash;I can read them out but I am sure you know it better than or at least as well as me&mdash;those people do not have any liability to return anything if they never earn an income or if they never earn above AWE. There are some people who are assisted in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not reasonable to talk about students repaying either because it does carry the implication that students while they are being students have the obligation to pay. Once students are finished their courses and are then working as professionals, as people employed in all sorts of areas, they then get to pay back the HECS. They are not paying it back as students. Again, I would say that is open to misinterpretation. The government is not persuaded by any of the arguments put by the opposition to change its mind. It looks as though, from what you have said, that none of you are prepared to change your mind, so I think we would all be assisted if we proceeded to the vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), and the two bills relating to the franking deficit and deficit deferral constitute a huge package of tax changes. Many of them are incredibly complex. They add hundreds more pages to the taxation laws. It is, quite frankly, disgraceful that the Senate is debating these bills only now, in the dying days of the spring sittings, and possibly the last three days of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had months to get these bills into order. These are taxation bills which flow from the budget or, indeed, from some earlier decisions prior to the budget. It is an indictment of the government's inability to manage its legislative program and a clear indicator of the disregard and contempt shown by this government towards the parliament that we are now, in such a compressed period of time and at such a late part of the session, debating the bills at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we are required to debate the whole package cognately, which greatly truncates the time available for debate, simply compounds the disgrace. How on earth can complex legislation of this nature that touches every Australian in one way or another be given adequate consideration in this time frame? It is blindingly obvious that the answer is that it cannot. Let me put down at the outset the coalition's attitude towards the two major bills: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995&mdash;and I will try to talk about some of the details later&mdash;the coalition is totally opposed to the government's attempt to destroy employee share acquisition schemes. We will, accordingly, be voting against that part of the bill. We will also move amendments to those parts dealing with the capital gains tax, rollover relief for merging superannuation funds, the proposals relating to local government councillors and the proposals relating to late lodgment penalties. We believe that in some of those the drafting is very faulty and inequitable. We will be seeking to improve those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is extremely concerned about the drafting of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995. We have taken very careful note of the wide range of representations that we have received on this matter so far as it relates to trusts. On behalf of the coalition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">", but the Senate, concerned at the nature, scope, impact and implications of the proposed amendments set out in Schedule 7 of the bill, resolves that the proposed amendments in Schedule 7 be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee, for inquiry and report on or before 13 February 1996".</PARA>
<PARA>It would be the coalition's intention that, when schedule 7 is eventually approved, maybe amended, as a result of the Senate committee's examination, the provisions of the bill should date from 9 May 1995, the date of the last budget, as the government has proposed in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will also be moving consequential amendments in the committee stage of the bill to remove the government's schedule 7 amendments from the bill so as to allow the passage this week of the other parts of the bill. The coalition will also be moving other amendments during the committee stage of this bill in respect of the retrospective elements of the proposals relating to capital gains tax on the tax paid by non-residents on Australian assets, in respect of retrospectivity in the government's proposals on dividend imputation and in respect of the R&amp;D tax concession proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn to some of the details of the two major bills; namely, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995. Time will prevent me from commenting at all during this speech on the second reading debate on the other two bills; namely, the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill 1995 and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Amendment Bill 1995. I hope to comment on those bills in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn first to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. This is an omnibus bill dealing with tax exemptions for state and territory bodies, employee share acquisition schemes, refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error, pensions, allowances and benefits, superannuation measures, late lodgment penalties and sales tax. The most substantive changes in this bill are contained in schedule 2, which deals with the tax treatment of employee share acquisition schemes. It is on that aspect that I would like to focus my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 replaces section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act with a new division 13A, which provides for the taxation of shares or rights provided to employees under an employee share acquisition scheme, commonly known as ESAS. This is the third occasion that this Labor government has attempted to legislate workable tax rules for employee share acquisition schemes, and it is the third occasion on which it has, sadly, failed. The reasons for that are complex, but basically the heart of it lies in the concern that the union movement and members of the rank and file of the Labor Party have in terms of employees having a stake in the businesses they work for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that these changes are necessary to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislation and to ensure that the tax concessions available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company in which they are employed or a holding company of the employer. The government claims that the measures will increase the taxation benefits available to employees under these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's claims are clearly one thing; the consequences of the legislation are quite another. When the current Treasurer (Mr Willis) decided to bring employee share acquisition schemes within the net of the fringe benefits tax, the consequences of his actions were made clear. The government was warned, but they refused to take advice from anyone involved in the schemes. They refused to listen to the concerns of industry. They even refused to listen to warnings from within Treasury. As is typical of this government, the Treasurer attacked the messenger, by claiming that anyone who disagreed with the government was a supporter of tax avoidance. That was a cowardly response and unbecoming of the Treasurer of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be absolutely and unreservedly clear on this issue of tax avoidance here and now: I and the coalition have always been and will always be committed to stamping out any action whatsoever that is designed for the purposes of avoiding the will of this parliament as expressed in its legislation, including its taxation legislation. That is absolute. It is a commitment set in stone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it equally clear that the coalition does not believe that our tax laws can be treated as if they are an end in themselves. They are not something which can be brazenly separated from the operation of the Australian economy and Australian society. Our tax laws must be drafted to take account of commercial, social and political reality. Sadly, it is apparent that our tax laws in respect of share acquisition schemes have been drafted only to achieve a fiscal outcome and to satisfy a political goal. The commercial reality and the social desirability of these schemes have been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was not surprised when the Treasurer was finally forced to concede, at the end of March this year, that his plan to impose fringe benefits tax on employee share acquisition schemes was ill-conceived and ill-considered. The proposed changes contained in this bill are the result of the Treasurer's earlier intransigence to reason. They are the result of the government's isolation from reality and its shelter in economic theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more critical, though, is that these changes&mdash;the latest changes in this bill&mdash;are also wrong. The government could have acted to amend section 26AAC to take out its flaws, which are recognised. Instead, the government proposes to introduce a new taxation regime which is only designed to make share acquisition schemes less attractive and less available to ordinary Australian workers. The proposals threaten the viability of current schemes and they restrict the potential for further expansion of employee share ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that employees should share in the wealth of the enterprise that they work in must surely be supported by every member of this chamber. Does any senator seriously argue that employees should not be able to enjoy the benefit of holding a stake in the future success of their employer, or that they should not have the opportunity to tie their own financial advancement to that of the company they work with and for? Certainly the coalition has no doubt on that score. We are totally supportive of employee share schemes that achieve that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that the government does not appreciate the benefit of these schemes. The benefit of employees having a capital share of their employer and the productivity and industrial relations benefits of these schemes should be unquestionable. Recent studies have indicated that the top 350 companies with a share plan outperform on every measure those without one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to speak on behalf of the coalition in support of the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which contains a number of amendments to various acts and is designed to implement the changes which were announced by the government in the budget. This is the second and final bill covering budget measures for veterans. Many of these amendments, as we see each year, mirror the changes that have been included in social security legislation and they are designed to bring veterans into line with the provisions which are operating under the Department of Social Security. The opposition does accept that the majority of the provisions in the legislation are designed to benefit veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) in his second reading speech in the other place specifically mentioned the needs of older veterans, most of whom are now in their 70s and who served in World War II. I agree with the minister that, while this has been an important year in which we have commemorated the achievements and the sacrifices of our veterans from that conflict, it is important that we also look ahead in seeking to improve the way in which we respond to the needs of veterans. Of particular importance at the moment is the needs of aging veterans. The focus on an elderly constituency has to be that much greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that there is now an initiative in developing a program for discharge planning. It is a matter which I raised at a meeting in Launceston only a few months ago. There has been much community concern there at the failure of hospitals and the department to work effectively together to put in place measures to support veterans and war widows when they are being discharged from hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All around Australia these days people are being discharged earlier and earlier. Many go home to an empty home or to a very frail spouse. These things have to be taken into account and planned for in advance so that we do not send veterans and war widows home to a crisis situation which so often leads to readmission to hospital and sometimes even worse. So I am very glad to see that initiative and the development of that program. I look forward to it being well introduced all around Australia with not much delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a particular affection for the program which enables carers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs to have respite care provided in the home. So many elderly people, especially if they become frail and confused, become even more frail and confused if respite care is provided in an institution with which they are not familiar. I would like to see the department focus more on the resources going into respite care in the home, wherever appropriate, of course, rather than in an institution. It is certainly much more cost-effective to provide it in the home and I think it is better for the veterans and the elderly war widows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So those are my personal prejudices, if you like, put on the record. We need to be focusing&mdash;and I recognise that the department is focusing&mdash;more and more on our veterans and war widows as people who are now quite elderly, in the majority of cases. I was also delighted to hear last night that a veteran has been successful before the High Court in not having to provide his tax file number. This is something that some of us have been concerned about for a very long time. I am glad to hear that, on the grounds of privacy, apparently, he won. I have no more information than that at this stage. Good for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I sit down I would like to mention another matter relating to another group of veterans whose sacrifice has not always been recognised as it should have been in this country. I am referring to the Vietnam veterans. Next year, between 12 and 18 August, there is to be a massive convention and reunion in Launceston. They will be celebrating and remembering 30 years since the Vietnam War and the event will coincide with the anniversary of the battle of Long Tan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisers in Launceston have undertaken a massive effort to notify veterans all around Australia, in New Zealand, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom about this convention. Of course, it is very hard to contact all those people who served together so long ago. I have offered to help in a small way by announcing this occasion in the Senate so that it will be recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I also hope that some people are listening as we broadcast today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Vietnam veterans who would like to receive information about the convention to contact me at Parliament House. I will pass the information on to the organisers of the convention. They are very keen to have these people come back after 30 years to rightfully celebrate being Vietnam veterans, which is a matter of honour. We should all honour the service they gave in a difficult campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisers do not have contact addresses for all units. If we could get information on those contact addresses, I will pass that on as well. Anybody who is listening today or who will read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> I urge to make contact so that we can make this the best possible reunion. The chairman of the advisory board is Brian Harper, and the secretary is Malcolm Merrick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this a great occasion for Vietnam veterans and their families to have a reunion, as a senator for Tasmania I can say proudly that it is also an opportunity for people to come and see our beautiful state, enjoy its heritage, perhaps some fishing, perhaps some snow, or whatever it is they would like to do in Tasmania. We are very proud of our state and it would be very worthwhile for people to combine the convention with a holiday. It is also an important convention for Tasmania from a financial point of view. Obviously, it is in the interests of everybody in Tasmania to encourage Vietnam veterans to come down and see us in August next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter relating to this conference that I would like to raise is financial assistance. The Tasmanian Vietnam veterans have made a huge undertaking but the resources they have are not all that great. I am very glad that the Liberal state government has made a financial contribution, undertaking to help with the costs. But, to date, there has been no such commitment from the Commonwealth&mdash;which, after all, is the level of government which sent these men away to fight on Australia's behalf. Surely, it is not too much to ask that the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs make a contribution to support this important reunion and convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to call on the federal government to match the state contribution dollar for dollar, and to make it clear soon that they will do it. After all, when planning a convention you need to know well ahead what resources you can call on if you are going to be as effective as you can be. I find it very strange that the Commonwealth, which has been approached on this matter, has not been prepared to make that commitment. I urge the government to think about this very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be no ordinary conference because the organising committee hopes to provide a forum for veterans to continue to strive for reconciliation and to fight for recognition from mainstream Australia. The convention will also provide an opportunity to air grievances, discuss needs, and meet with the government and its representatives. They will also be having workshops, which will be joint efforts between the veterans, the association and the government to discuss current and new issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the convention will also provide an opportunity for discussions on the future involvement of the Vietnam veteran as a representative Australian veteran. As our World War II veterans age, the leadership of the veterans' community will start to pass, as it already has, to the Vietnam veterans. It is very important to these veterans themselves and to our country that they be included as an honoured part of our veterans' community&mdash;and that means that at the government level, the RSL level, with other veterans' organisations and in the wider community Vietnam veterans of Australia feel that they are honoured, as their fathers and grandfathers have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I call on the federal government to demonstrate that that is also their view. They can achieve this by making sure that the resources necessary for this important convention to go ahead are provided not only by the state government but also, equally, by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(12.55 p.m.)&mdash;The measures in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1995-96 Budget Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1995 before us are largely beneficial to veterans and are to be welcomed. As we have such a short time today and, indeed, wanted to see this legislation passed before the end of the session, we have agreed to have it during the non-controversial business time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Democrats do have one or two areas of concern. In view of the shortness of time, I would just mention those particular concerns. We have been contacted by Aged Care Australia, who are worried about the administration of the residential care allowance. They foresee nursing homes and hostels being involved in considerable changes to the fee charging arrangements when the administration of this allowance reverts to the Department of Human Services and Health in one or two years time. They have written to the department expressing their concerns and are awaiting a reply. The Australian Democrats will be carefully monitoring the implementation of this new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second area of concern is the change in the threshold for rent assistance. My colleague Senator Woodley has already addressed this at considerable length yesterday when we discussed the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995. Whilst we welcome the increase in rent assistance payable to single or illness-separated pensioners, or to pensioner couples with dependent children, by $5 a fortnight, we are disappointed to see that this will be paid for by an increase in the rent threshold for all pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in rent assistance will cost the government $0.23 million in the four years to 1998-99, yet the increase in the rent threshold of the same time frame will save $4.05 million. In other words, the winners in this policy change, those who gain, will do so at the expense of other veteran pensioners&mdash;and there is still, for the government, a substantial net gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are not supporting this increase. We will not put it to the vote, as we are in the noncontroversial bills session, but we do wish to register our very strong opposition to this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to mention very briefly that we have been receiving frequent and very serious complaints about HACC services for veterans. These appear to relate to a couple of states in particular, but they are certainly Australia-wide. In this regard it seems that a number of states are not carrying out their obligations. Certainly, as veterans age, they are going to require additional home based services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have yet to be convinced that the Commonwealth is fulfilling its undertakings to veterans in this area. Indeed, as we move into the new session of parliament next year, the Democrats will be monitoring the situation very carefully and have already been considering a reference to one of the Senate standing committees on this issue, requesting that it look at the whole issue of home care services and support services for veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1995-96 Budget Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1995 which is now before the chamber. It contains a range of measures which were announced at the time of the budget in May this year. The majority of these changes are most welcome. It is not my intention to take up the Senate's time with a detailed analysis of the bill, but there are two matters with which the Greens have problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem is the increase in the rent threshold for those receiving rent assistance. I thought that the Democrats would be putting an amendment to overturn this measure, and such an amendment would have had support. However, on listening to Senator Lees I realise that, because of Senator Woodley's failure to convince the chamber of support for similar amendments in yesterday's debate on the social security bills, the Democrats will not be proceeding with that intention. Therefore, I want to express the concern of the Greens on this issue. We would certainly vote against this part of the bill if it were going to the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measure is the increase in the guardian's allowance. As with the Social Security bill dealing with this matter, the increase is to take effect in September next year. This is a budget measure announced in May this year, and the government is getting the kudos for having announced it in May this year, but is not intending to deliver on that promise until September of next year. We believe that that is an outrageous and unacceptable delay for those awaiting this much needed increase. We will put an amendment which brings forward the increase to December of this year and I trust that the amendment will gain the necessary support. It is not a fair commitment by the government in the budget to then defer it to such a degree that it disappoints the people who had assumed that they were going to receive some consideration under this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this bill has been classified as non-controversial, and has been placed in the lunchtime on the basis that divisions will not be called, it is necessary to just seek the support of my colleagues for my amendment and to have that amendment rise or fall on their voices. At this point, I state a personal protest at the way in which the government has organised the program so that bills that are clearly worthy of some debate of the decisions being made are being crammed into the lunchtime. It is a failure in democracy that divisions cannot be called. In that respect, this bill should not be appearing at this time. It does not have the consensus of the chamber and it should not be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will probably reiterate that remark from time to time over the next two days because I believe that the government, instead of prioritising its bills, and limiting it to those that are absolutely essential, has used what I could only class as emotional blackmail on those people who feel that they want to support the good measures in this bill by forcing them to limit the debate on measures within it that are not desirable. Because the Greens are supporting the bill, I am simply making that personal protest. I would urge the government and the opposition to give consideration to my amendment and support it when it comes to the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 replaces the original bill, the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). This was the bill that the Labor government completely botched when it went through the parliamentary process last time, a mistake which only highlighted its ignorance of procedures in the House and here in the Senate itself. After a charade like this, Labor has absolutely no right to complain about delays of legislation in either house of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition basically has no real problems with the legislation and we will not be opposing its passage. However, we do wish to highlight and strongly oppose the incompetence that the government has shown in its dealing with this bill. You will recall that that incompetence saw the original bill divided on the floor of the Senate and thus rendered inoperable. That incompetence arose from Labor's arrogance and lack of respect for the institution of parliament. I can go further along those lines but I think the government might have received the message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we are in effect revisiting the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1)&mdash;again, thanks to Labor&mdash;a lot of the issues in this bill have been gone over and now we have a chance to do it all again. For this reason, I will mention the major issues that have already been raised and then focus on health care and aged care, both of which were raised in these bills and both of which are issues which are, and should be, of increasing importance and interest in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment bill repeals the Handicapped Person's Assistance Act 1974. Schedule 1 proposes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. Schedule 2 proposes technical amendments to a number of acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care rebate is aimed at strengthening the act and clarifying and helping to facilitate certain procedural aspects of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. Several of these amendments provide hardship provisions to help those people who are currently excluded from the rebate scheme but who should be able to get it: for example, children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special needs requiring ongoing child care; carers under the age of 18 who have certain child-care qualifications; and parents who are currently unable to have work related commitments because of extenuating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to administrative issues and technical errors, amendments are needed to make consequential changes to the act to bring it in line with changes to other Commonwealth legislation. These other administrative arrangements allow the delegation of powers by the managing director of the commission, allow the minister some discretion over receipting requirements, strengthen powers to overcome overpayments of the rebate, allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the date at which they were first eligible to register, also cancel family or carer registrations and recover payments when an administrative error has been made. They also ensure that the rebate is not paid for child-care costs which have been, or will be, reimbursed by another agent such as an employer. They clarify that the rebate is payable for child-care costs incurred for certain specified absences from care and also clarify the backdating of family registrations, as well as the eligibility of overseas students to claim the rebate, by amending the courses of study that are described and correct technical defects in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the Health Insurance Act 1973, the amendments are needed to correct drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which established the services review scheme, and allow for the appointment as presidents of the professional services review tribunals persons who hold, or who have held, judicial office in state and territory jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the report of the professional services review board was to be debated and it somehow dropped off the list. But I thought it was interesting in that report that $1.3 million has been spent in over the 12 months since that tribunal was established. From memory, 27 deputy commissioners have been appointed on a part-time basis and something like 132 reviewers. After the expenditure of that sum, that extent of money, not one health professional has been reviewed in the 12 months. It reminded me very much of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> program about the hospital that had been functioning very successfully without any patients. This is another example of that construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to the Health Insurance Commission is an amendment to expressly give the Health Insurance Commission the function of providing consultancy and management services to the Commonwealth and other Commonwealth bodies. The amendment also enables the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized pursuant to the execution of a search warrant until the reason for its seizure no longer exists or a decision is made not to use it in evidence. The National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 has amendments to specify that, before appointing the chairperson of the council, the chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee or a member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research, the minister will consult with each state and territory health minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the amendments relating to nursing homes and their regulation, these amendments remove several provisions relating to review of decisions and adding merit review rights for decisions on the amount of Commonwealth benefit that may be advanced to nursing home proprietors. These proprietors should be able to see how the level of Commonwealth benefit has been calculated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an amendment relating to exempt bed status by giving the minister the power to revoke or suspend this status if the nursing home fails to satisfy nursing home care standards. This is because a criterion for granting an exempt bed status is that the home provides a higher standard of accommodation and services than normal. This amendment will ensure that standards are maintained and make sure that the extra charges for these nursing homes are justified. This is something that is very important and is an issue which Senator Patterson has pursued in estimates, particularly before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example she raised during the February estimates earlier this year highlighted this fact. Without mentioning names, there was a nursing home in Victoria which was charging excessively high fees and not providing adequate services accordingly. In fact, in a standard monitoring visiting report done by the federal Department of Human Services and Health, of 31 standards only eight were met. Yet, because it was an exempt bed status nursing home, it was charging $915 a week. Of course, the department had received complaints from relatives and patients, and from the time she raised it, it had been six months without any action. Hopefully, this amendment will prevent this situation occurring again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports this amendment, it is merely a small step in the direction of things that need to be done. Australia's ageing population is increasing in numbers and is obviously going to continue to do so. This is something that the government continues to ignore. Over and over again, we see cases of Labor discriminating against and neglecting our older Australians. Over and over again, we point out these policies and actions hurting the aged and over and over again, the government turns a blind eye, ignoring these problems and failing to take adequate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poor treatment of the aged includes things such as the funding crisis in nursing homes. Professor Gregory's report stated that over $100 million per year was needed to upgrade and maintain basic standards for nursing homes. What do we see&mdash;the government allocating only $36.4 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nursing home subsidies and domiciliary care subsidies were cut by $11.2 million in the budget. Obviously what is needed is a more flexible system which will ensure that there is adequate funding available to run nursing homes and hostels but also to enable them to be properly maintained and upgraded. It is crucial that there are adequate infrastructure and appropriate funding systems in place in the aged care sector as we move into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aged care sector is facing pressure from changing community expectations. Aged people and their families have increasing expectations of the physical and quality of life standards in aged care. So there is an ongoing need to upgrade facilities and the quality of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the treatment of dementia. The government has failed to recognise the needs of people with dementia. Ambulant dementia sufferers who have severe behavioural problems often have been inappropriately `integrated' with other hostel and nursing home residents. In many cases, the dementia sufferer is disruptive and can negatively affect the quality of life of other residents in the integrated facility. Where dementia-specific hostels have been established, the inadequate level of government funding has rendered the facilities unviable unless they are cross-subsidised from other sections of the aged care facility. Despite desperate pleas from the aged care sector, the government has refused to consider a more appropriate level of funding for these residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The self-funded retirees are affected. Having been denied the l-a-w law tax cuts promised by Mr Keating, they will not benefit from the government's proposed superannuation contribution in lieu of these tax cuts because retirees do not pay into superannuation funds. Carers are also affected. Only $10 million has been allocated over three years in the budget, that is, only $3 million per year which would go nowhere to meet the needs of carers for income support. Carers such as residential aged carers have been discouraged by the lack of trust and respect the Labor government is giving them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, the need for aged care and aged care places is on the rise. There will need to be incentives for private enterprise as well as the government and the not-for-profit sector to enter the field. It is also essential that government, aged care providers, consumers and carers work together as a team to develop an aged care system that meets the ever changing needs of the aged. As I mentioned earlier, the coalition does not oppose the passage of the bill. However, these are amendments which should have been passed much earlier and should have resulted in a lot less wasted time, time which was lost due to Labor's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While amendments to areas such as health and child care and in to relation nursing homes are a step in the right direction, there is still a long way to go. This is something the coalition and the community recognises and in government we will address these issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 June despite the fact that it is, in the main, a non-controversial bill, was not debated in the House of Representatives until 28 September. It has now been with us for some time but has not managed to struggle its way up the list. It is an important bill, despite the fact that it is non-controversial in the sense that the opposition does not oppose the bill. It is an indictment, again, of the government's conduct of business in this place that it leaves a bill of this nature to be debated on what is the second or third last sitting day of this session&mdash;and possibly the second or third last sitting day of the parliament. The bill gives effect to the government's decision announced in the 1995-96 budget to amalgamate the Merit Protection Review Agency, the MPRA, and the Public Service Commission, PSC, to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background to this move, following the abolition of the Public Service Board as part of the extensive machinery of government changes which were made back in 1987, three central agencies were given defined roles in relation to personnel management and industrial relations in the Australian Public Service. These agencies are: the Department of Industrial Relations; the Department of Finance; and the Public Service Commission. The Public Service Commission has approximately 150 staff and a running cost budget of around $17 million, although its net outlays in 1995-96 will be only $13.25, according to pages 64 and 65 of the portfolio budget statements for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Commission is responsible for all appointments, promotions and terminations within the Senior Executive Service, which is the top management group within the Australian Public Service. The Public Service Commissioner also has a range of responsibilities in relation to non-SES staff employed under the Public Service Act 1922. Non-SES staff comprise a very large number of staff&mdash;about 140,000. The responsibilities of the Public Service Commissioner include establishing employment and staffing policies and guidelines covering recruitment, promotion, mobility, discipline, equal opportunity in employment, redeployment and retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner is also involved in some case work, principally in the area of redeployment and placement of excess staff. The commissioner has responsibility for entry level training policy and for developing core competency standards for all staff. Individual departments, however, have responsibility for the implementation of core competency standards as well as the development of agency specific competences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Commission does not have the same powers and responsibilities as did the old Public Service Board that it replaced. It is not easy to draw a concise yet entirely accurate distinction between the old board and the Public Service Commission. But, in broad terms, the Public Service Commission provides advice and promulgates guidelines, whereas the board used to set rules and frequently was itself a prime decision maker in relation to individual staffing matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other agency&mdash;the one it is proposed be merged with the Public Service Commission&mdash;is the Merit Protection and Review Agency. It is a statutory body that was established under the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees Act) 1984 to provide independent review of decisions and actions affecting Commonwealth employees in relation to their employment. It has been argued that the agency has a key role in human resource management in the Australian Public Service because of the major impact that many of its decisions have on staff management practices, including time management and agency performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MPRA has the equivalent of 56 full-time staff positions. It has a running cost budget for 1995-96 of approximately $6.56 million, although this amount is reduced by receipts to give a figure of about $4.58 million for total outlays in the present financial year, according to the portfolio budget statements for 1995-96 for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. This information is shown on pages 73 to 75 of the portfolio budget statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill looks at the amalgamation of two important agencies. As I said, it is a pity that there has been such a delay in the bill being debated. It is worth pointing out that the decision to amalgamate is contrary to the recommendation in the report of the Public Service Act Review Group, commonly called the McLeod report. That report was released in January of this year. That group was set up under the chairmanship of Mr McLeod to review the Public Service Act, and it did not, in its report, recommend the merger of the Public Service Commission with the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Indeed, it recommended that the Merit Protection and Review Agency remain separate. The agency, by its nature, is a joint union and management body whereas the Public Service Commission is all about management structures. Whilst the two are somewhat complementary, they are of themselves very different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing the legislation. Indeed, we support the legislation but there are a couple of points that need to be made about the Public Service. I make these points bearing in mind the fact that the savings to be achieved as a result of the amalgamation are said to be modest. So it is not going to achieve a big deal with respect to savings and government finances. One of the things that concerns the coalition is that it appears that Ms Forward, the Director of the Merit Protection and Review Agency&mdash;and this emerged from evidence that she gave at the Senate estimates hearings earlier this year&mdash;was not consulted in any significant way, if at all, about the amalgamation before the announcement of the amalgamation. It was during those hearings that my colleague Senator Minchin asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were you given the opportunity for consultations about the advantages or disadvantages of this prior to a decision being made or was it something that you read about in the newspaper?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Forward responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither of these reflects the facts of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>So, quite clearly, she did not have much of an input into what was going to happen. It is equally clear, I think, that the agency or its principal officers feel that a greater degree of consultation would have been desirable before the decision was taken on the agency's future. That this consultation did not occur is a reflection, I think, of this government's lack of commitment to both the principles and practices of open government. If the government is unwilling to enter into consultations with its own employees, it is little wonder that the general public is cynical, and increasingly so, of the government's advocacy of open government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other issues that the coalition wishes to raise about this proposal. The effect of the proposal will be that members of the agency, including the director, will retain their officers after the merger whilst the Public Service Commissioner will have the powers of a secretary in relation to the staff of the new commission. It is expected that the Merit Protection Commissioner will exercise personnel and financial management powers in relation to officers required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three issues have been raised regarding this bill. Firstly, is the amalgamated agency guaranteed continued resourcing and independence? Secondly, will the proposals of the McLeod report be implemented in full and, if so, will the agency's workload decline as a result? Thirdly, is it appropriate to create one body which both makes personnel management rules and adjudicates on grievances arising from the administration of those rules?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are important questions and I think that people can have genuinely held, differing views on those, on all of them really, but particularly on the question of whether one organisation should be able to make both personnel management rules and adjudicate on grievances arising from the administration of those rules. We may have had some similar experience of this in the past but, for most of the period of the Commonwealth Public Service, there has been a separation, as I recall it, of the agencies that look at the promotion and appeals system compared with those that are formulating the personnel management rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that putting the two together will necessarily cause problems of a great magnitude, but it is something that will need to be handled very carefully. I hope that the parliament will have an opportunity to monitor the progress of the amalgamated body to ensure that the concerns that have been raised by some people in relation to the amalgamation so far as that aspect is concerned are not actually fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional issue concerns the functioning of the MPRA itself and the manner in which it conducts its investigations. That is evidenced by the controversy surrounding the investigations into the management of the Australian War Memorial which have been&mdash;and I think still are&mdash;the subject of legal action. They have caused considerable community concern and they have raised serious questions about the agency's procedures. That is a separate issue to some extent from the question of the future of the agency itself, but they are matters of concern. In the amalgamated organisation it will be important that those matters are reviewed so that the concerns that have been expressed, and the questions that have been raised, about the quality and nature of the Merit Protection Review Agency's procedures are fully examined and that, where change is necessary, the changes be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the financial impact of the proposals is small&mdash;indeed, somewhat surprisingly small, in my view. The combined budget of the two agencies is something of the order of $20 million per annum. According to the explanatory memorandum, the amalgamation will reduce outlays only by approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and in subsequent years. Any saving is a worthwhile saving, but it does surprise me that the saving is as small as that. It is a very small proportion of the combined budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said those things, the coalition supports the amalgamation. It is an important developmental step in Public Service procedures. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) is able to comment on this, but I have just received today in the rounds the statement by Gary Johns, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters. It is a document headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A New Public Service Act: a progress report to the House of Representatives</EMPHASIS> which is dated November 1995. I just picked it up as I came into the chamber so I have not had the opportunity to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document presents an outline of a Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 which proposes a major rewrite of the Public Service Act. Amongst other things, it says that in May of this year the government accepted Mr Johns's recommendation that the 1922 act should be repealed and replaced with a new Public Service Act.

Certainly, $200,000 is modest in that context, but a saving is a saving.

The statement that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Mr Gary Johns, has released really is unconnected with the legislation in the sense that it is a progress report on the review of the Public Service Act. I understand there will be an act introduced in the new year. While I am on this issue, I would point out that the McLeod report did not make a recommendation on the amalgamation of the two organisations that we are dealing with in the legislation. It did not make a comment either for or against. It did review the agencies but it did not say, `Don't amalgamate them,' or `Do amalgamate them,' so the report was neutral in that sense.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry Commission Amendment Bill 1995 amends the Industry Commission Act of 1989 to allow greater flexibility in the operation of the Industry Commission. The bill contains four main amendments. The first amendment is to allow the appointment of commissioners, other than the chairperson, on a part-time basis in addition to the current full-time basis. The second amendment is to allow a consequential increase in the maximum number of commissioners, other than the chairperson, from eight to 11. The third amendment is to allow a single commissioner to act on behalf of all other commissioners on an inquiry in the absence of other commissioners, but limits inquiries to public hearings and then only in emergency situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment is to require full-time commissioners to obtain the consent of the minister to engage in paid employment outside the duties of his or her office. The amendment also is to restrict part-time commissioners from engaging in paid employment that, in the minister's opinion, conflicts with the proper performance of the commissioner's duties. The amendments are, overall, sensible proposals for amendment, and the coalition does not oppose these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some points to be made in relation to at least two of the amendments. The first amendment to allow the appointment of commissioners, other than the chairperson, on a part-time basis in addition to the current full-time basis is aimed at increasing the commission's chances of attracting a more diverse range of suitably qualified people. The commission will be able to recruit people holding other positions who are unwilling to become full-time commissioners. This a very sensible proposal because there is a wealth of talent out there in the general community, particularly in the business world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people who have business experience and who would be eminently qualified and suitable for working with the commission, but whom you will not get unless you are able to offer work to them on a part-time basis, rather than a full-time basis. This amendment should, in itself, widen the potential pool of suitable people considerably. The members of the coalition think that this is a good idea and we certainly support it. However, it does mean, as the second amendment makes clear, that there would be a consequential increase in the maximum number of commissioners. The proposal in the bill is that this consequential increase be an increase of three, which means that the number increases from eight to 11. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment that requires a brief comment is the third of the four amendments, the one allowing a single commissioner to act on behalf of all other commissioners on an inquiry in the absence of other commissioners, but limited to public hearings and only in emergency situations. That amendment will apply where unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury prevent one or other commissioners on an inquiry from participating in the public hearing. In such circumstances the remaining commissioners will be able to preside at the public hearing or part of a public hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of the proposals is said to be nil; it does not have any financial implications. I am pleased to note that the government has said that, should the number and mix of full-time and part-time commissioners increase beyond the present funding levels, an increase in funding would be sought through the normal budgetary processes. On that basis and given the fact that the proposals look sensible and will add to the flexibility and the operations of the commission, and will enable the government to attract a wider range of qualified and experienced and relevant people to serve on a part-time basis as commissioners, the coalition supports the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cook. I remind the minister that last month he told the Senate that the government's `tax policies are in the budget'. Four days later he said, `To the best of my knowledge, we have not formulated our tax policy for the next election.' A week ago he said, `We do not intend to introduce new taxes in the forthcoming election and in winning government, subsequent to that.' And yesterday he indicated that the extent of the government's commitment was only to keep general taxation revenue as a proportion of GDP at around their current levels. The minister has enunciated four different positions in the space of just over one month. In those circumstances, minister, I ask what is your current position? Will you rule out new taxes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot of the quotations that have just been retailed to me have a familiar ring, but they do lack the context in which they were made. There has been a thread of consistency through the position that I have put all along.

The line of consistency is there and it is strong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to power in 1982-83, the tax revenue to GDP ratio in Australia was 24 per cent. In the year 1995-96 we expect the level of tax as a percentage of GDP to be 24.2 per cent. In other words, what I am saying here is that we came to power in a recessionary climate in which the level of growth in the economy was low and when you would expect, because there were fewer people employed, there was less business activity and lower profits, the returns to the Commonwealth in the form of taxation to also be low. But what I am pointing to now, in an economy which today's national accounts underline more pointedly than any other question that I have got from Senator Hill in the last two years, in an economy which is a strong and growing economy, is that the burden of taxation on Australia for the 1995-96 year is expected to come in at 24.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in a strong economy when there are more people employed you would expect to obtain more taxes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 April this year I asked Mr Opie, who is the president of the Australian and New Zealand Sports Law Association and a respected Melbourne University legal academic, to carry out the independent inquiry. Mr Opie received more than 150 written submissions, and over 160 witnesses from across Australia were interviewed, some of them more than once. Evidence was taken from a broad range of people, including current and former gymnasts and their families, officials in the sport, AIS and external administrative, medical, scientific  and coaching personnel and various other people who have an interest in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key findings of Mr Opie's inquiry were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost all allegations of abuse by the Inquiry pursuant to its terms of reference have not been proven and the media reports of April and May 1995 must be regarded as greatly misleading. No systematic or widespread abuse of AIS female gymnasts has been found to occur at any time. The Inquiry did not find any credible evidence of inappropriate treatment of gymnasts currently in the program.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Opie also found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry did find a handful of complaints of past inappropriate treatment to be proven which in the overall circumstances of the Inquiry are relatively minor. These related to the inappropriate use of the sauna in the first half of 1986 and to one incident of hitting and two incidents of rough handling of the one gymnast in late 1992 or early 1993 by a coach who was employed by the Australian Gymnastics Federation at the time. He was based in the AIS gymnasium but is no longer associated with the AIS. No physical injury was caused by that inappropriate treatment.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that these allegations of abuse within the women's artistic gymnastics program at the AIS have been thoroughly investigated by Mr Opie. I am satisfied that there are no inappropriate training methods or abuse occurring within the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry has recommended counselling for the coach involved in the 1992-93 incident, and that particular coach's conduct will be referred to the Australian Coaching Council and the Australian Gymnastic Federation. It is important to point out that this coach is no longer associated with the AIS and was not an AIS employee at the time of the incident. The inquiry has not recommended that any action be taken against the coach involved in the 1986 incident.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Treasurer. The minister would be aware that today's national accounts show that seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 1.6 per cent in the September quarter and by 3.3 per cent through the year, exceeding the median market expectation of around 1.3 per cent. A stable economic environment with appropriate fiscal responsibility contributes to this continued growth. Can the minister explain the benefits of this continued growth for the Australian economy? Can he also indicate how this would be affected if the government happened to be one which was unable or unwilling to show strong leadership and fiscal responsibility in order to maintain a stable environment for industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the national accounts for the September quarter 1995. To the last of those questions that have been put to me, I would say that it would create a framework for the national economy in which you could not expect the same levels of jobs growth, profit or overall economic growth or investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the other parts of the question. For most of this year Mr Howard has been saying that the economy is highly vulnerable and that we have only had five minutes of economic sunshine. So much for Mr Howard and so much for those senators opposite who have been enthusiastically endorsing his rhetoric. Today's national accounts showed that the economy is in very sound shape indeed. We have recorded the longest period of continuous growth since records commenced in 1959. All the indications are that the economy is set to continue growing not just for several more quarters but for several more years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should never forget just how dismal a failure Mr Howard was when he was Treasurer. We have just recorded 17 consecutive quarters of economic growth. That is four years and three months of growth. The best Mr Howard could manage when he was Treasurer was five consecutive quarters of economic growth. That is a measly one year and three months of growth. If 17 quarters equals five minutes of sunshine, the best John Howard can manage as Treasurer is one minute and 28 seconds. At once, the stark comparison reveals John Howard's past failure and exposes the opposition's claims about five minutes of economic sunshine as distortions and as nothing more than hollow rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we have smashed the economic growth record is, of course, tremendous news for Australians. But what makes this recovery particularly special is that for the first time in a generation we have been able to combine strong growth with low inflation. When John Howard left office in 1983 we had a recession, double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. In contrast, today's national accounts show an economy that grew by 1.6 per cent in the September quarter in seasonally adjusted terms and by 3.3 per cent through the year to the September quarter 1995. The national accounts also indicate that inflation continues to remain moderate. Over the last year the private consumption and non-farm GDP deflators, which are broader measures of inflation than the CPI, both increased by less than three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to strong growth and low inflation, the highlights of the recovery so far include real wages up by six per cent, real household disposable income per capital up by 12 per cent, productivity up by 13 per cent, total private new capital expenditure up by 31 per cent and company profits before income tax up by 150 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the remainder of 1995-96, continuing high levels of employment vacancies, strong international competitiveness and high levels of activity in the September quarter all point to continued economic and employment growth and further falls in the levels of unemployment. That is good news for Australia.</PARA>

So I will decline the invitation to speculate on interest rates inherent in this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question goes more broadly to measures in the national accounts about the performance of the economy. I have just answered a question from my colleague on the back bench about the performance of the economy. In summary, we have strong, steady growth. We are past the boom-bust cycle. We are into a steady but strong, nonetheless upward trend line for economic growth for Australia. The important characteristic of the quarterly accounts that came out at 11.30 this morning is that this strong growth is married to historically low inflation. For the first time in a generation Australians are looking at a growth economy with low inflation. That is good news for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the question also related to productivity, and productivity measures in the national accounts. If one turns to productivity measures for Australia, one would have to say, looking at the history of the Australian economy, that we are witnessing now historically high levels of productivity, particularly labour productivity, in the economy. If we compare levels of productivity now with the time when the coalition was on the treasury bench, we see they are higher now. One of the reasons why they are is that we have introduced other measures which have encouraged investment in capital equipment, thus improving the stock and efficiency of plant and equipment in Australia, which means that the input of labour creates a vastly greater output in productivity terms. We have also decentralised the wage fixing system and enabled collective bargaining to ensue in the workplace and traded productivity gains for wage increases, which has also underpinned productivity growth. We are looking at strong, historically high productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the question goes to the earnings part of the national accounts brought down today. The earnings measure shows higher earnings by ordinary Australians. That is not a bad thing&mdash;ordinary Australians having an extra few dollars in their pockets. That is attributed to an increase in farm earnings because of the end of the drought&mdash;and farmers having more income as a consequence&mdash;and the propensity for more overtime to be worked in the economy, and to productivity changes as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of what Professor Fels has said. I must say I think he was stating the obvious in that there are close links between competition policy and trade policy.

The Australian government does support those discussions and does support a continuance of those discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure Senator Boswell that nothing in the recent amendments to the Trade Practices Act or in the government's national competition policy increases the scope of the ACCC to involve itself in anti-dumping matters. For the information of the Senate, the only part of the Trade Practices Act which deals with anti-dumping is section 46A. This section applies only to dumping disputes between Australia and New Zealand. That change was made to the Trade Practices Act in 1990 with the agreement of the New Zealand government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point of the matter is of course that the nuclear powers are committed to absolute elimination of nuclear weapons by virtue of signing up to article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty. That is the goal to which they have committed themselves already. The question is about the practical attainability of that goal. Those of us who argue for absolute zero as being not only desirable but achievable do so in the context of making the point that, if you are serious about non-proliferation, the existing nuclear weapons powers are going to have to get serious for the first time about elimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a big problem about working out how to achieve stable deterrence all the way down to zero.

Given this cost, it is imperative that this issue be tackled on all policy fronts by both federal and state governments. In an all-out effort to halt and reverse the degradation of our land and water resources, this remains one of the key tenets of this government's rural and environmental policy strategies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in fact the only detailed opposition policy document that has been released since the last election; the only one. It completely contradicts the paragraph that I have just quoted. The drought policy advocates the reintroduction of fodder subsidies that clearly encourage overstocking during drought. That is one of the known features of drought subsidies and that is why drought subsidies were rejected comprehensively by all ministers&mdash;Labor and non-Labor&mdash;as far back as 1992. Such subsidies remove the encouragement for livestock producers to reduce stocking levels and to conserve pastures at a time when they are most vulnerable, and that is during a drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is further land degradation through overgrazing&mdash;overgrazing that then increases the severity of the next drought. It is a vicious circle; one that all ministers&mdash;Labor and non-Labor, as I said&mdash;broke in 1992, and it should remain so. All of those ministers since&mdash;Labor and non-Labor&mdash;have consistently rejected at every meeting of ARMCANZ where this has come up the reintroduction of these fodder subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I mention that is that the opposition's commitment to fodder subsidies was explicitly reaffirmed by Mr Howard only a week or two ago in a tour of New South Wales drought areas. He pledged that the opposition would reintroduce an ancient policy that has been comprehensively rejected by every primary industry minister in Australia irrespective of their political affiliations. As long as that remains the official policy position of the opposition, it cannot claim to be really serious about land degradation being the most pressing environmental problem&mdash;which it is&mdash;that this country has.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr President, I ask you to reconsider the ruling you gave during question time in response to a number of points of order from this side about the statement, `You know "what you are saying is untrue" is not unparliamentary.' During question time I had the opportunity of reading through a booklet entitled `Rulings of the President of the Senate from 1953 to 1971', volume XI, which details a few rulings. For example, ruling 229 is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not in order for a Senator to refer to the answer given to his Question as being "false and misleading".</PARA>
<PARA>There are a lot of other examples. For example, you are not allowed to say that something is a `distortion of the truth'&mdash;that is ruling 107. Ruling 132 says it is a `disorderly expression' to refer to somebody making an `untruthful statement'. `The senator forgot to be a little bit honest' is also a disorderly expression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With due respect, there are numerous rulings from former presidents indicating that a reflection on somebody's integrity in relation to knowingly not telling the truth is imputing improper motives, is a disorderly expression, is disorderly conduct and should therefore be withdrawn.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on the point of order: as I understand your ruling, it was not simply in response to a suggestion that `What you are saying is false' may or may not be, depending on your judgment, out of order. On the basis of previous decisions by the chair quoted by Senator Abetz, it may well be that a senator who says, `What you are saying is false,' could be held to be in breach of the standing orders. However, today's question time problem emerged not out of that statement but out of a statement that said, `You know what you are saying is false.' It is the `you know' element that provides the imputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I support Senator Abetz's request to you to reconsider is that it may well be that you did not focus&mdash;and there was plenty going on at the time&mdash;on those first few words which changed the nature of the remark by Senator Cook to make it a far more serious and offensive remark than the suggestion which is often made that `What you are saying is false or untrue'. To say, `You know what you are saying is false,' cannot be anything else than an imputation that you are doing something deliberately that is wrong and improper. Surely that is an imputation, and I ask you to reconsider your decision. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day relating to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in relation to the secret tax agenda of the Keating-Willis Labor government. I think this minister when he answers economic questions is given a brief at the beginning of the week. I think they sit him down on Monday morning and say, `Senator Cook, no matter what they ask you about the economy this is the answer.' He is very sure of himself when he is on this brief. They probably sit him down there for a couple of hours and train him away after he has had his morning cup of tea and his sleep in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week it was: `Minister Cook, you have had your cup of tea. The line this week is that the general level of taxation as a percentage of GDP was worse under John Howard than it is under our government. Whatever they ask you, whether it is to do with your tax agenda or any other economic question, just keep saying that. Here's a little speech that will last exactly four minutes. If they ask you a supplementary, just do the best you can, but this is the speech and stick to the line. It doesn't matter what they ask you. Whether it is Senator Hill or Senator Alston or anyone else, just stick to this line.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook gets himself in all sorts of trouble when he goes off the line. The briefings on Monday morning when he gets on the plane coming back from Perth are getting longer and longer. Senator Cook is getting better at sticking to the line. Earlier in question time&mdash;and it is a little bit off the subject&mdash;he was asked a question by Senator Hill in relation to four different statements he had made about tax policy. He has made a couple more today and that is clearly where he wandered off the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make in taking note of his answer is that tax is something you can quote in terms of the statistics. If you want to look at the statistics as far as tax as a percentage of GDP is concerned, all you need to look at is the statistics that applied in Australia under the Whitlam government. Most people have a clear recollection of tax policy under the Whitlam government and some of the geniuses they had as Treasurers of Australia during that short period in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax rate at that stage was much lower as a percentage of GDP than it is now under this Labor government. One of the great achievements of Mr Keating, regarded in the early 1980s by the people who gave him the award as `the world's best finance minister' or Treasurer, as we call it in Australia, is that he, who has been a great critic of fiscal discipline under the Whitlam era in his unguarded moments, has achieved a higher tax rate as a percentage of GDP than was achieved under the average years in the Whitlam regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I checked with the library during question time and the average rate during 1972 to 1975 that people like Senator Herron will remember as times of economic chaos in Australia was 22.6 per cent. Of course the average rate under the Keating government and as his time as Treasurer is significantly higher than that. Well done, Mr Keating. Well done, Mr Willis. You have outdone Jim Cairns and Gough Whitlam. You have actually achieved much higher rates of taxation as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more important to families, however, because the rate of tax as a percentage of GDP would be almost an irrelevant consideration to them when they sit down to do their budgets at the end of the week and their tax returns at the end of the year is how the tax system in Australia and how Mr Keating's taxes affect them as a family. When this government wants to look at international comparisons, it should turn to a very important study done by the OECD as late as only a couple of years ago&mdash;in fact, 1992; not that long ago&mdash;which compared the impact of income tax as a percentage of gross earnings with the average wages of a family with two children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contemplate what that study does. It looks at the impact of taxes in Australia on the average family, with a couple of kids and probably living in the metropolitan area of one of Australia's great cities. What is the answer? It shows that Australia has higher tax as a percentage of gross earnings on families than Luxembourg, France, Portugal, Japan, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, the United States, Belgium, Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Ireland&mdash;and even higher than Norway. In fact, there are only four countries in the OECD that have higher taxes on average families than Australia. They are Denmark, Sweden, Finland and New Zealand. That study was done in 1992. I suspect the OECD are updating that. It will be interesting to look at what has happened since the 1993 election because we all know that, despite the promises of the Keating government, taxes like sales taxes and petrol taxes have increased since then. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Cook did his best to dress up what really were a very disturbing set of national accounts released today. The most disturbing thing about them was the revelation that economic growth has slowed right down to an annual rate of 3.3 per cent, which is way down on what it previously was and what the government boasted about. The really disturbing thing about that level of growth is what it means for the three-quarters of a million Australians who cannot get a job under this government. These figures are very bad news for jobless Australians and mean that they will have great difficulty getting a job, and that in fact unemployment will continue to increase with a level of growth of that low order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the national accounts figures do is reinforce something that the National Institute of Labour Studies said in its September 1995 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Bulletin of Labour</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medium term forecasts suggest that achieving an unemployment rate much below 7 per cent by the start of the 21st century will be difficult unless labour force growth slows and productivity growth remains flat. The government's Working Nation target of a 5 per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000 will not be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an authoritative statement from the well-respected and independent National Institute of Labour Studies, pointing out that the five per cent target has no hope of being achieved. That conclusion is reinforced by the figures released today showing growth slowing to 3.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make two other points there. They say that even achieving the seven per cent will be difficult unless labour force growth slows and productivity growth remains flat. Of course, the government is increasing the growth of the labour force by its own policies, contradicting this, and the government has today boasted, through the form of Senator Cook, about the growth in productivity. So those two prerequisites themselves set by the National Institute of Labour Studies are being breached by the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute itself thinks that the best we can possibly achieve is an unemployment rate by the year 2000, which I point out is only four years away, of 7.3 per cent; and even that figure would require an annual economic growth of 3.7 per cent over the next four years, which of course is higher than the growth we have seen today. The economy is clearly slowing; the growth is likely to decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute said in this report which has just been released that if average economic growth falls below 3 1/2 per cent, unemployment will actually begin to rise. Of course, today's figure is 3.3 per cent. I heard a bank economist today commenting on these figures say that he expects that unemployment will be back over nine per cent very soon, based on these figures. So this five per cent target, which the government still proclaims to support, has been blown apart by this report and by today's figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows that economic growth would need to average 4.2 per cent to achieve this five per cent target, which of course is out of the question. We have only achieved a rate near 4.2 per cent in one out of every three years over the last 15, so that figure cannot be achieved. The institute notes that the growth rate required to achieve a five per cent target of unemployment is simply not sustainable under current economic policy. That is why this government has to be defeated. That is why, for the sake of the unemployed, we need a change of government and a change to the economic settings so that we can achieve the five per cent target which under current settings we simply cannot do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current settings, if we are to have the current rate of growth required to achieve the five per cent target, we will obviously have increases in the rate of inflation and a worsening of the current account deficit, which is already in a disastrous situation. That was the import of my question today about inflation. These national account figures show that we are about to face a very significant inflationary problem. We have wages and salaries growth hitting 7.4 per cent, way ahead of productivity growth and clearly putting a lot of pressure on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line in all this is clearly, based on the national accounts and on the report of the Institute of Labour Studies, that the government's economic policies have failed Australians, particularly the three-quarters of a million Australians who cannot get a job under this government. They have failed young Australians, a whole host of whom are about to come onto the job market in January. The government has failed them miserably and must be defeated. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Evans's answer reveals the priority given by him to this topic in that he was not able to respond, even in a small way, to my question. I know that he has many matters on his mind. In recognition of that, his office was informed three-quarters of an hour before question time that he would be receiving a question on that topic. However, as I told him in a note, it is `questions without notice' and his failure to answer not only wasted my last question for the session but prevented me from asking a supplementary. I said to Senator Evans that I was sure he would be extremely distressed on my behalf. He owned up to his truthfulness in his response when he said, `I cannot tell a lie; I am not deeply distressed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the question because it is a very important matter. The reason I asked Senator Evans a question in relation to this area is that I wanted to draw attention to a very negative state of affairs in regard to the funding for representative bodies. It appears that while the Native Title Act explicitly allowed for more than one body to exist in each region to allow Aboriginal communities to make a choice where there was a possible disagreement with a particular representative body or where there were two communities with competing claims over the same area&mdash;a very sensible provision&mdash;it appears that there is a proposition to reduce the options of Aboriginal communities to only have one representative body for each region. I very much wanted the minister to comment on this and to give us some kind of answer as to whether this has already been accepted as government policy and certainly to challenge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I believed needed to be drawn attention to, which I would have raised if I had the opportunity, was that over 40 per cent of ATSIC funding for these representative bodies is allocated to two land councils&mdash;the Kimberley Land Council and the Cape York Land Council. I believe that there are some serious questions that need to be addressed, which the minister clearly does not have under his purview regarding the equitable access for Aboriginal communities to assist them in native title claims. I believe that the government needs to commit itself to reviewing the nature of the distribution of funding to representative bodies and address the questions of equity that are plainly disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will later seek leave to incorporate two incredible graphs that illustrate this vividly. The first one simply shows the range of funding available to the different representative bodies. It demonstrates visually the malapportionment of funding to the two land councils that I have already mentioned. That is further exacerbated if we look at the second graph, which lays alongside that same graph and shows the percentage of population that is being served by these representative bodies. It is an absolute outrage. It extends the whole inequitability of funding that has been exposed in this government's response to native title, land funds and, presumably in the future, to the social justice package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extremely inequitable to excessively favour, in this case, certain northern land councils as opposed to those in the southern part of Australia. It is actually penalising those Aboriginal people who have experienced more dispossession, more extinguishment of native title. So, of the 250,000 Aboriginal people, we have three groups&mdash;one which may have some chance of receiving native title, and they may be five per cent of that number; one group which may have access to a land fund, which is approximately 15 per cent; and the rest, 80 per cent, being totally ignored and increasingly dispossessed with every moment that passes. They are the same names&mdash;all in the north&mdash;that appear on all the funding bodies, on all the funding that is given for native title, for the land fund and, presumably, it will be the case with the social justice package. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Herron this day, relating to proposed changes to Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>The question I asked was a genuine one. I have raised this matter of fraud over the last five years. It may be recalled that some years ago the Auditor-General produced a report saying that massive fraud was occurring in relation to Medicare. The community affairs committee was given a briefing to consider the Auditor-General's report. The government came out backing the Auditor-General's report and said that fraud to the extent of $400 million a year was occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I questioned the basis for that figure and it was found that the basis was an estimate made on figures given in the United States as a percentage of the total amount spent on Medicare there. So, in fact, there was no basis for the figure. I pursued Minister Richardson over the matter. The figure shrank from $400 million to $80 million. I questioned it at estimates committee hearings. The figure now, with regard to money that is refunded to Medicare, is in the vicinity of $1 1/2 million. So it is a rapidly vanishing figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) announced yesterday that from 1 December a person can go to a Medicare office with a receipt form and a Medicare card and get an immediate cash refund without having to fill out a form. This opens up the potential for fraud of a major nature.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give three instances. It may be that the government is not concerned if a patient gives a valueless cheque to a doctor. This has occurred, particularly in relation to radiology services. A patient can write a valueless cheque, get a receipt from the doctor, and now they will be able to go along to Medicare, produce a receipt, get a cash refund and they are on their way. The government does nothing about pursuing that. I know this has occurred in a number of instances. They say to the doctor, `That's your problem. If you accept a valueless cheque, that's too bad.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect to it in addition to the valueless cheque situation. The government does not pursue that, even though it might occur on a number of occasions, because they consider it is not their problem. However, I know of another situation. I know this debate is being broadcast and I do not want a sudden rush of events to occur around Australia, but I think I should bring it to the minister's notice because it has occurred and it can occur under this system. A patient goes to the doctor complaining of a major headache. Eventually, upon the diagnosis determined by the general practitioner, the patient is sent for a CAT scan of the brain. That costs in the vicinity of $400. The patient pays with a valueless cheque, goes to the Medicare office, gets a refund of $400, and the cheque bounces. The next day the patient goes to another GP, complains of a headache, goes through the same process, pays with a valueless cheque, goes to the Medicare office and, as of Friday, collects another $400. That is a fraud on Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question was genuine. With these new changes, because there is no form to be filled in now as a result of these changes, what are they going to do to stop patients committing this type of fraud? We know from the prosecutions that have occurred that more fraud, numerically speaking, is committed by patients than by anybody else under Medicare. Twice as much fraud is committed by patients over and above the next step of fraud, which is done by secretaries producing a false receipt book. This lays it right open for anybody with a receipt book or a stolen receipt book, as has occurred in the past, to go along with a receipt and a Medicare card and get a cash refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third event, as I said, is intentional deliberate fraud. That has been done by a number of doctors. In the last 12 months, the average number of doctors who have committed fraud is about 53&mdash;it has been 52 and 45; it varies. Of the 47,000 doctors in Australia, 52 or 53 have committed fraud. We get this continual doctor bashing about doctors rorting the system, whereas the majority of rorting is done by patients by intentional fraud; secondly, by secretaries by theft; and, finally, by doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very genuine question. The minister said that it has been addressed. I am sure she did not understand the question&mdash;that should have been fairly obvious to anybody who was listening. It may be that she washes her hands and the government washes its hands of it in relation to doctors, but my concern, particularly as a taxpayer and as a representative, is Medicare itself. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney this day, relating to road funding.</PARA>
<PARA>You can always tell when you have got Senator Bob Collins on the backfoot, because he assiduously avoids the key point in question. He does not even address it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why he refused to address the key point of the question on black spots is that, in the first year of this government's black spot program, which started after the horrific bus smashes near Kempsey in 1989, the government did spend money on back spots; in the second year they reduced the funding significantly; in the third year, after the accident, they reduced it even more; and then the year after they cut it out and it has not come back since. Yet up the entire length of the north coast on the Pacific Highway, the worst interstate connection in Australia, there are still hundreds of black spots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the disgraceful situation where the former Liberal government's plans for Motorway Pacific were totally scrubbed by this Labor government. They have no plans to do anything about a road which is 700 kilometres long and yet has 64 kilometres of divided road. The rest of that road is just 1950s-style goat track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went north on the youth bus tour&mdash;and it is the first time in 15 years I have been on that road on a bus&mdash;I could see as we went around those corners and across those bridges how dangerous it was and why we have such horrific bus smashes on that road. I remind the Senate and the people of Australia that, in the last 10 years, 766 people have lost their lives on that road. How many accidents? Ten thousand accidents. Yet the way in which governments, state and federal, are now approaching this matter, it will be 20 to 30 years before the road will be corrected to what is needed now in 1995, let alone what is going to be needed in the year 2015. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road connects two of the largest cities in Australia, Sydney and Brisbane&mdash;and by the year 2030 Brisbane will be the second largest city in Australia. What you have between them is a goat track and there is no plan to correct that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only bit of substance in the minister's answer to my question was, `We're spending the money around your area, Senator,' referring to the Hunter Valley. Oh, is he? Let me read from an article in today's paper entitled `Council roadwork funding cut $2.5m'. It was $3 1/2 million last year and it is $1million this year. The new Carr Labor government has chopped it to one-third of what it was. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Director of Transport and Works Mr Phil McLeod said the RTA had made little room for special projects . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"There is no doubt Maitland is experiencing a downward trend in regard to roads funding.</PARA>
<PARA>Notorious accident black spots, such as Raymond Terrace Road, Woodberry Road, Scotch Creek Road and Martins Wharf Road, are now going to be abandoned. What this state Labor government is doing in the Maitland area, which the minister was holding up as the shining light, is following his example: keep reducing black spot funding till it totally cuts out. How many more accidents do there have to be on that road? How many more deaths do there have to be on that road? How much more trauma will the families of New South Wales have to suffer before this government acts and treats the Pacific Highway as a road of national priority and funds it properly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole problem underlying what is happening is that Labor governments significantly and increasingly continue to reduce the money they spend on infrastructure, particularly roads. The last time the Liberal Party was in power federally, in 1982-83, we were spending 62.4 per cent of the fuel excise on road funding. When those horrific bus accidents occurred on the north coast, that amount had dropped from 62 per cent to 20.8 per cent. Since that time, it has dropped to 8.4 per cent. The government rips off 92c of fuel excise dollars and does not put it back into roads. That is why we have these accidents; that is why we have these deaths. It is about time the Labor government woke up to this and started spending proper funding on the roads of Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will weasel your way out of anything. We know all about you. It is worth looking at particular aspects of road funding. In looking at what has happened over the last three years, we see that in 1992-93 there was an increase of $1.1 billion in the take from fuel excise, in 1993-94 it went up a further $1.3 billion and in 1994-95 another $1.3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tierney has said, we see a gradual decrease in the percentage of what goes back into road funding. It is estimated that, in the year 1994-95, the government put $820 million into road funding, which is even less than what was put back into road funding in 1982-83. There has been a gradual decline in percentage terms of what is being put back. The actual amount that went back into road funding in 1994-95 was $817 million. The forward estimates for 1995-96 is $840, which is an increase of $20 million on the previous year's estimates, yet there is a further take on petrol and diesel excise in the order of $1.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the fundamental reason why we have enormous deterioration of infrastructure and the road systems throughout this country. It underlines the points Senator Tierney made in his question today to Senator Bob Collins and is the very reason that Senator Collins cannot give a satisfactory answer in terms of the situation that exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Labor government came to office in 1983, the excise was 7c a litre. Today it stands at 33.5c a litre. I also note that the $9.7 billion taken from motorists today represents $570 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Commonwealth government fuel taxes make up 50 per cent of the retail price of each litre of petrol&mdash;that is, at a price of around 67c to 68c per litre. By contrast, oil company revenues make up 32 per cent of the price of fuel and the dealer margin is only 2.9 per cent to 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the fuel excise has become a milking cow for general revenue for this government. They need to recognise, firstly, the importance of bringing a halt to the massive increases in fuel excise and the damage that is doing to living standards and businesses throughout Australia, particularly those involved in farming and mining; and, secondly, the costs which exist with regard to that. The excise on light crude in Western Australia puts up the cost of carting a tonne of grain to port by an average of between $2 and $2.50 per tonne&mdash;an enormous additional direct cost that that industry has to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I just want to put on the record that, in terms of the government's performance since coming to office, as far as fuel excise is concerned, the increase has been absolutely massive. It has been very close to 500 per cent; I think the exact figure is 498 per cent. Yet, at the same time, alongside that, we have seen a gradual reduction in the amount of money going back into our roads. We have seen a significant deterioration of our roads right across Australia, particularly in the northern parts of Australia, the western parts of Queensland, the western parts of New South Wales, the northern parts of South Australia and through the hinterland of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People living in the metropolitan areas, for example, do not recognise this. They see their highways, the fast-lane traffic and the various things that go there. But when you go out into the rural areas, the regional areas and the mining areas you find that in some instances bitumen roads are being pulled up because they cannot be maintained because the Commonwealth government has reduced so significantly the level of funding in real terms for the task that is required to keep those roads in reasonable order. The government needs to reassess the situation of fuel excise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee Report on the above mentioned Bill was tabled on 6 March 1995. The Committee's Report was in 2 parts, the first dealing with the Family Law Reform Bill 1994, and the second dealing with the exposure draft Family Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1994. An interim response to the Committee's report, responding to the recommendations about the Family Law Reform Bill 1994, was tabled in the Senate on 29 March 1995. This final response is in relation to the second part of the Committee's Report, and deals with the exposure draft Family Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee commends for the consideration of Government the matters raised before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The matters raised before the Committee included</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an alleged lack of adequate consultation</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a questioning of the need to change the matrimonial property regime at all</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the failure to deal adequately with financial resources, particularly superannuation</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the perceived presumption of equal sharing of property, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the perceived need for Court approval of financial agreements and consent property orders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters have also been raised in submissions to the Attorney-General and his Department. The consultation process has been most helpful, and has given rise to a number of proposed amendments to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee, by a majority, recommends that the Court when considering how matrimonial property is to be distributed starts from the presumption that each of the parties have contributed 50% of the resources used to obtain it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The draft provisions of the Bill are consistent with this recommendation. It is clear from the text of the Committee's Report that the majority supported the provisions of the draft, accepting that they would avoid futile arguments relating to financial and non-financial contributions, largely reflect the existing law, and provide a more `structured' approach to the issue of property settlements (paragraph 2.28). The Bill goes further than the recommendation, and sets up a rebuttable presumption that the parties have made an equal contribution to the marriage as a whole, including the acquisition of property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that subsection 86C(2) be amended to add an additional factor which recognises the limitations upon the capacity to earn income (and by extension to accumulate assets) created by parenting responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The thrust of this recommendation is accepted. Subsection 86C(1) is the provision of the Bill which provides initially that the contributions of the parties to the marriage as a whole are assumed to be equal, unless the Court finds that they were not in fact equal. Subsection 86C(2) sets out the historical matters that a Court may have regard to in determining the contribution that each party made to the marriage in fact. It would not be appropriate to insert into this section a provision that would explain why a party made a greater non-financial contribution than a financial one, which is what the Government understands the thrust of this recommendation to be. Subsection 86C(3) provides that financial and non-financial provisions are intrinsically equally significant. A provision along the lines recommended would not affect the finding of relative contributions. However, a provision should be added to clause 86D to specifically recognise the lack of income due to parenting responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the expression `history of the marriage' in proposed section 86C(2) be clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Accepted. This expression will be deleted. The reference to the history of the marriage has been the subject of much criticism, especially along the lines that it might reintroduce an element of fault into property proceedings and invite consideration of domestic violence in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that pre-nuptial agreements be non-enforceable but be available for use as evidentiary material in relevant proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: This recommendation is not accepted. Binding pre-nuptial agreements are a cornerstone of the revised property regime. The Committee was concerned that such agreements could be oppressive, particularly of women. They also reflected a view that there should be mandatory prior independent legal advice. The Bill did not contain provision for prior independent mandatory legal advice because it was not considered desirable to compel parties to resort to this expense before entering into an agreement. There are adequate protections in the Bill in the provisions relating to varying and setting aside. After all, parties do not have to have independent legal advice before buying property jointly, making gifts to one another, or making wills in favour of one another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A dissenting report by Coalition Senators urged the Government to again address the issue of assumed equal contribution to the marriage as a whole, and in particular the meaning of `the history of the marriage' in proposed section 86C(2)(a).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The Government accepts the thrust of this recommendation. The Government views seriously concerns that the new regime will disadvantage women and that the starting point of assumed equal contribution to the marriage as a whole will become a de facto finishing point of assumed equal entitlement of distribution. The Government will do a number of things to meet these concerns. The provisions of the Bill will be redrafted so that it is absolutely clear that the 50/50 starting point is a starting point only, and that it relates to contribution only. It will be made clear that property will only be divided in proportion to contribution to the marriage as a whole where there are no other factors, such as future needs, that would make a distribution of property on another basis more just and equitable. Amendments will be made to the Bill to ensure that financial resources will be properly taken into account. There will be an intensive education program by the Government, in conjunction with the Family Court and the legal profession, to explain the amendments and their operation, and to dispel any misunderstandings that have arisen. The expression `the history of the marriage' will be removed from proposed paragraph 86C(2)(a).</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CONDITIONAL MIGRANT ENTRY: THE HEALTH RULES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">INQUIRY TERMS OF REFERENCE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of reference for the Inquiry into Conditional Migrant Entry undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations (JSC) focused on the feasibility of allowing migrant entry to Australia, on a conditional basis for those applicants who do not meet the health requirement on the grounds of undue cost or prejudice to the access to health care of Australian permanent residents or citizens. The conditional entry was not to be available for those persons who pose a threat to public health or a danger to members of the Australian community. The terms of reference required the committee to give particular attention to the operation of the Migration Regulations in cases of disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OVERVIEW OF REPORT</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its report Conditional Migrant Entry: The Health Rules, the JSC recognised the extreme complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved in the health requirement for entry to or stay in Australia and that only a small number of cases are affected by the lack of conditional entry provisions. The JSC confirmed that the primary obligation of the health requirement is the protection of public health and safety, community resources and access by Australian citizens and permanent residents to expensive and scarce medical and welfare services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JSC made twenty-one recommendations which cover a number of distinct areas in addition to conditional migrant entry (Rec. 15-17), that is technical recommendations relating to the health assessment process (Rec. 1-3, 5, 9, 10, 14), assessment of applicants with disabilities (Rec. 4, 7, 8, 11, 18), health standards (Rec. 6), protection of public health (Rec. 12, 13) and access to Medicare and related fraud (Rec. 19-21).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the JSC's recommendations are wide ranging and complex they deal with only select aspects of the health requirement and health screening process for entry to or stay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the conditional migrant entry (CME) recommendations, the government has decided not to proceed with a CME scheme at this time due to the significant practical and conceptual difficulties in developing a scheme that could be integrated and operate effectively with the current health requirement. The detailed reasons for this are outlined in response to Recommendation 15.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In examining the CME and other JSC recommendations, the government has concluded that priority should be given to a more fundamental examination of the current health requirement with a view to rationalising the existing health regulations to make them clearer and more transparent, to develop and enhance existing guidelines and standards, and make the health requirement more sensitive and responsive to current community views and practices. While the JSC did not canvass the question of medical review, the feasibility of establishing an appropriate formal medical review mechanism is being considered in the examination of the current health requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Human Services and Health are undertaking a joint review of the health requirement and associated procedures for entry to Australia. Individual recommendations of the JSC, where agreed to by the government, will be implemented in the context of the review. This review builds on review activity to date such as the provision of greater flexibility in the use of the health waiver in response to JSC Recommendation 3. In many respects this and other fine-tuning of existing policy (in the context of the review) will provide the flexibility in the operation of the existing health rules which the JSC was looking for in recommending a CME scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health regulations set down in the Migration Regulations, Items 9 and 10 of Schedule 1 and regulation 144 be redrafted so that the commonwealth medical officer is responsible for decisions on the medical matters, while the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is responsible for decisions concerning the costs of treatment and availability of medical resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is accepted the Migration Regulations will be redrafted to clarify decision making responsibilities as part of the review of the health requirement and associated procedures. As indicated in the response to Recommendation 3, the government has, in the context of the review of the health requirement and associated procedures, amended the health waiver so that DIEA officers are responsible for decisions on the question of prejudicing access to scarce medical resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demarcation of responsibility in health decision making be set out clearly, and the allocation of responsibility be consistent between the substantive health criteria (Schedule 1, Items 9 and 10) and the waiver provision (Regulation 144).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. To be pursued in the context of the response to Recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 144(2)(d) be amended to remove the term `any' from the text of the provision, so that, as one of the conditions for the grant of a visa or entry permit for classes to which the waiver applies, an applicant must be unlikely, as a result of a disease or condition, to prejudice the access to health care of Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents. Due to concerns, though, that this recommendation may liberalise inappropriately the waiver provision, recommendation 3 should be implemented only if it is possible to make the minister's decision concerning waiver non-compellable and non-reviewable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in part. The government has, in the context of the review of the health requirement and associated procedures, amended the Migration Regulations to provide greater flexibility in the exercise of the waiver. The waiver was not previously available for exercise in those cases where the Commonwealth Medical Officer was of the opinion that the applicant was likely to prejudice the access of any Australian citizen or permanent resident to health care. The amended waiver provides for DIEA officers to make the final decision on the question of prejudicing access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any move to make consideration of the waiver non-compellable and non-reviewable would be inconsistent with the current decision making structure. The current structure requires decision makers to consider whether or not to exercise the health waiver (where it is available) and such decisions involving the waiver are in many classes reviewable. The increased flexibility in the exercise of the waiver does not inappropriately liberalise the waiver provision, it simply allows DIEA decision makers to consider the question of prejudicing access in the same way as the question of whether an applicant is likely to represent an undue cost is currently considered. Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis in the light of individual circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing provisions dealing with the health requirement, namely the Migration Regulations Schedule 1, Items 9 and 10, regulation 144, section 20 of the Migration Act 1958 and regulation 176, be amended to provide separate categories for assessment of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)diseases and medical conditions; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted. In making this recommendation, the JSC acknowledged that there would be conceptual and drafting difficulties in separating disease and disability in the Migration Regulations. Furthermore, it noted that neither the Disability Services Act 1986 nor the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 would provide the basis for such a classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the considerable difficulty of distinguishing disability from disease and medical conditions there would also be significant practical problems in obtaining complete and reliable assessments overseas. A further consideration is that, other than public health, the current health requirement essentially relates to cost and access to community resources, and these are equally relevant to both disability and medical conditions. While the recommendation is not supported, briefing papers and guidelines for medical officers will address the particular factors that need to be considered when assessing people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations set to accompany the Migration Bill 1992 should provide that non-citizens who are permanent residents should not be vulnerable to cancellation of their visa when they are outside Australia because of a prescribed disease, medical condition or disability, providing that their prescribed disease, medical condition or disability was acquired subsequent to the person's first arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The Migration Reform Act 1992, implemented on 1 September 1994, replaced the previous automatic cancellation powers of section 20 of the Migration Act 1958 (for visas and entry permits under prescribed circumstances) with a discretionary provision for the cancellation of visas for prescribed reasons. In any event, and irrespective of any prescribed health criterion, returning residents are not subject to the cancellation of their visas as a result of a disease, condition or disability acquired subsequent to their first arrival in Australia as a permanent resident. Official DIEA instructions to Migration Officers state that visas held by permanent residents returning to Australia must not be cancelled on health grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Priority be given to the production of the background briefing papers for commonwealth medical officers on the assessment of medical and disability conditions. These papers should provide up to date and realistic assistance to the commonwealth medical officers in forming opinions on whether or not applicants meet the health requirement for entry or stay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The government strongly endorses the need for relevant, comprehensive and current medical information to be available to support the medical assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four background briefing papers are currently used by medical officers. The papers cover Psychiatric Disorders, Frail Aged, Chronic Kidney Disease and HIV Infection and AIDS. In addition, work is progressing with papers on Vision Impairment/Blindness, Intellectual Disabilities and Accommodation for People with Disabilities. The development of these papers involves broad consultation with medical specialists, colleges and organisations who provide services, and advocacy groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope and relative priority for extending the current background briefing papers is being established as part of the review of the health requirement and associated procedures. This also includes examination of an appropriate mechanism for developing and maintaining background briefing papers and the related resourcing implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guideline briefing papers issued by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs for use by commonwealth medical officers in assessing people with disabilities against the health requirement be based on accepted principles for the assessment of disabilities and be regularly updated in accordance with the latest research data on the various forms of disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In assessing a person with a disability, sufficient emphasis be given to the likely contribution to the Australian community of the disabled person's family as a unit and to the capabilities of the individual. To this effect, the commonwealth medical officer or, where appropriate, the processing immigration officer should gather data relevant to the Minister's decision whether or not to grant a visa or entry permit or, where relevant, to exercise the health waiver, including data on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the nature of the disability;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the age of the person;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the opportunities for employment and likely benefits to the community of the disabled person and other members of the family unit;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)the capacity of the family unit to provide adequate lifetime care and support to the disabled person, without undue cost to the community; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)the extent to which entitlement to government-funded support can be claimed, regardless of a person's means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. This recommendation is being further examined in the context of the review of the health requirement and associated procedures. Many of the factors recommended to be taken into account when assessing applicants with disabilities are already included in the assessment of the health waiver in those classes where it is available. One difficulty is that of objectively assessing the likely contribution which the applicant or the applicant's family may be able to make to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the response to Recommendation 3, the review of the health requirement and associated procedures to date has resulted in the health waiver being amended to provide greater flexibility in its use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless there are sound reasons to the contrary, the Regional Medical Director Bangkok report to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, as is the case for all commonwealth medical officers and the Regional Medical Director Paris.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted. The Regional Medical Directors (RMD) are located in Bangkok and Manchester and are employees of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA). Although the RMDs undertake the tasks of Commonwealth Medical Officers, their major functions are more closely aligned with DIEA processing functions including the monitoring of the panel doctor system used in most countries to conduct medical examinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 10</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequent upon recommendations 1 and 2, the arrangements for demarcation of responsibility between the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the commonwealth medical officer, as enunciated in the Policy Control Instructions, the Procedures Advice Manual and the background briefing papers be brought into line with the Migration Regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 11</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health screening standards and procedures used in assessing people with disabilities for migration purposes be aligned as closely as possible with the tests applied by the Department of Social Security in determining eligibility for the Disability Support Pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. The assessment of migration applicants with disabilities already incorporates, to the extent practicable, the same considerations relating to assessments for the Disability Support Pension (DSP). Any further alignment of assessment processes is not considered feasible because of the different purposes of the assessments. The DSP assessment is fundamentally directed towards ascertaining the extent of impairments and work ability while the migration health assessment focuses on public health, cost and use of community resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 12</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of protecting public health, testing for hepatitis B in particular be wider than is presently undertaken for migration purposes (pregnant women, children for adoption and unaccompanied refugee children) and be introduced for groups which, in relevant medical literature, are recognised as being at high risk. On entry, persons from those groups or countries of origin should be required to produce a certificate of immunisation or accept vaccination by state health authorities as a condition of entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted at this time. Consultation to date between DHSH and members of the Communicable Diseases Standing Committee (CDSC) of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Gastroenterology Institute (AGI) indicates that there is no consensus on the public health benefit of implementing this recommendation. Matters relating to hepatitis B immunisation and screening are currently being examined by the NHMRC's Panel on Hepatitis B. This Panel is expected to report within the next 12 months.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An effective and timely reporting system be introduced whereby the results of medical examinations for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B are passed to state and territory health authorities by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, to enable appropriate public health standards to be implemented by those authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. A system is already in place whereby the medical documents of applicants who may require monitoring of their tuberculosis or hepatitis B status, are passed to the health authority in the state or territory of the applicant's intended residence in Australia. The review of the health requirement and associated procedures to date has resulted in amendment of the Migration Regulations to require such applicants to provide a written undertaking to put themselves under the supervision of these authorities where this has been requested by a commonwealth Medical Officer. Options for strengthening the post-arrival compliance with these undertakings are being considered by DHSH and DIEA. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 14</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the regulations drafted to accompany the Migration Reform Bill 1992, the special category New Zealand visa class be included with those for which the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs can waive the health criteria, provided that the minister also would exercise such a waiver under similar circumstances for citizens of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted. The Special Category Visa class has been developed under the Migration Reform Act 1992 for New Zealand citizens seeking entry to Australia and was implemented on 1 September 1994. Consistent with the policy of free movement of people between New Zealand and Australia and advice from DHSH on the standards of health in New Zealand, the health requirement for this class prescribes tuberculosis as the major disease of public health concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 15</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general rule, in cases where an applicant does not meet the prescribed health criteria and does not satisfy the health waiver provisions, before entry or stay may be approved, the applicant or a sponsor pay to the commonwealth an up-front fee. The amount of the fee should equal the costs, as determined by the Commonwealth Compensation Commissioner, of ongoing treatment, care and assistance, over the lifetime of the applicant, which are likely to arise as a result of the medical condition or disability identified by the commonwealth medical officer as the reason for the applicant's failure to meet the health requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted. A thorough examination of the feasibility of the introduction of an up-front fee as recommended by the JSC revealed significant practical and conceptual difficulties in developing a scheme that could be integrated and operate effectively with the current health requirement. It is considered that a conditional migrant entry (CME) scheme is largely incompatible with, and would have the effect of undermining, existing health policy arrangements for different visa categories. A range of specific concerns were identified in relation to factors considered as either being essential in supporting a CME mechanism or being significant obstacles to the introduction of such a mechanism. These related to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Assessment of costs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to develop more sophisticated medical and related costing standards particularly to support a system of actuarial assessment and medical review. In this context there is also a need to further develop existing medical background briefing papers [response to Recommendation 6 refers].</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A CME scheme would create policy tensions irrespective of whether selective or open access is provided. Limiting access to the CME scheme would be inconsistent with the apparent intent of the recommendation and would be interpreted as discriminatory in application. On the other hand, provision of open access would result in considerable tension between the CME mechanism and current policy for many visa classes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, spouse visa applicants currently have access to the health waiver, full merits review and Ministerial discretion while the humanitarian classes have access to the waiver. This reflects the relative policy priority attaching to these visa classes. To subsequently provide access to a CME mechanism (for the relatively small number of unsuccessful humanitarian and spouse cases) would either:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">undermine the current policy intent in that these applicants would be highly unlikely to afford a CME fee with the result that yet further consideration would be given to the compelling nature of these cases (despite the exhaustive consideration preceding CME consideration); or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">be considered sufficiently at variance with the policy objectives of these classes to be considered inappropriate to even contemplate the payment of a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, it would be inappropriate to provide access for applicants failing to meet the entry requirement for visa categories (such as for concessional family) where the government had already decided not to provide a waiver. To provide such access would also undermine the current policy intent in that it would invariably result in consideration of compelling circumstances, where the government has not provided for such consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waiver</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing medical waiver/review/Ministerial discretion mechanisms would conflict with a CME scheme and accompanying Ministerial discretion [response to Recommendation 17 refers] in a way which would make it difficult to preserve the integrity of the existing discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Equity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are considerable reservations regarding the equity of a CME scheme. The availability of a CME scheme would either be discriminatory in terms of those likely to be in a position to afford what is expected to be a very substantial average fee (estimated by the JSC to be in the order of $200,000) or otherwise incompatible with the objectives of visa classes such as those with humanitarian or close family objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Operation of a CME scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A CME scheme would be complex and cumbersome to operate. The extreme complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved was acknowledged by the JSC as was the fact that only a small number of cases are affected by the lack of conditional entry provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potential Demand</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on information from the newly installed computer system (MIDAS), operating since mid December 1993, it is estimated that there would be in the order of 200 applicants failing the health requirement each year who may be eligible for a CME scheme. However, this number could be heavily discounted for those who are subsequently approved through exercise of the health waiver, the review process or Ministerial intervention as well as those who would not be in a position to pay the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would also be significant co-ordination and logistical difficulties in implementing and operating a CME mechanism. Establishing even a reasonable estimate of lifetime medical costs would be an imprecise and resource intensive process. If this is extended to include lifetime non-medical costs (such as special education requirements, welfare entitlements and supported employment) and an assessment of the likely contribution which the applicant or applicant's family may be able to make to Australia (pursuant to Recommendation 17) then the level of complexity, subjectivity and precision required would increase dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Impact on health budget</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A likely perverse outcome of introducing a CME scheme for all applicants for permanent residence in Australia is that rather than recouping the potential health costs to the community it is likely to result in a net additional cost, thus frustrating the existing health requirement. It is probable that the combination of having open access to a CME scheme and a Ministerial waiver mechanism would have a negative impact on the health budget due to the anticipated requests and compulsion for Ministerial waiver. The administrative implications of such a situation would be difficult to contemplate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Review</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently no formal medical review mechanism to support the introduction of a CME scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the introductory response to the JSC recommendations, the recommendation for a CME scheme was in large part predicated on a perceived need to provide greater flexibility in the operation of the existing health rules. It is considered that the existing health rules already provide considerable flexibility where that is the policy objective (through use of the health waiver, access to merits review and Ministerial discretion) and that further flexibility could be achieved by simply fine-tuning the policy. The recent change to provide greater flexibility in the operation of the health waiver (response to Recommendation 3 refers) is considered to have largely addressed the JSC's concern for greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 16</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a supplement to the up-front fee proposed in recommendation 15, the government investigate the feasibility of implementing an insurance bond system and/or a loan arrangement for applicants who do not meet the prescribed health criteria or the waiver provisions and who are unable to pay an up front fee to the commonwealth. In any such arrangements, the need to protect the revenue over the lifetime of the applicant should be a relevant consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted. Establishing alternatives to an up-front fee, such as bonds or insurance, is not feasible. Consultations held by the JSC with a number of financial and insurance institutions revealed no interest in offering such services. This reflects the fact that the risk of insuring persons with known diseases/conditions of sufficient severity to result in a failure to meet the health requirement is likely to be too great to be an attractive commercial proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 17</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequent upon recommendations 15 and 16, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs be provided with a discretion to consider the circumstances of the applicant, particularly the likely contribution which the applicant or the applicant's family may be able to make to Australia, and either:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted. Linked to any further consideration of Recommendation 15.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of a Ministerial waiver to accompany a CME scheme would result in considerable conflict with the existing medical waiver. In particular, consideration of "compelling cases" in the exercise of the CME waiver would conflict with the operation of existing waiver/review/Ministerial discretion mechanisms where the consideration also relates to compassionate and compelling circumstances. As indicated in the response to Recommendation 15 it would result in a policy tension by creating a discretion in those classes where the government had already decided not to provide a waiver. It is also indicated in the response to Recommendation 15 that an open access CME scheme in conjunction with a waiver will likely result in a net additional cost for the health budget. An additional significant difficulty is that of objectively assessing the likely contribution which the applicant or the applicant's family may be able to make to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 18</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining whether to grant an adoption visa or entry permit to a disabled adoptive child who cannot satisfy the health criteria, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs consider the financial and other family support able to be provided by the adoptive family and the circumstances of the adoptive child, particularly whether these factors could outweigh any likely costs to the community or access to community resources in short supply. In such cases, the entry or stay should be approved only where appropriate guarantees of support can be provided and where the relevant state welfare authorities have approved the intending adoptive parents as capable of parenting the child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. The health waiver is available to the children for adoption class and already allows for consideration of the particular circumstances of the child against the likely cost to the Australian community that the child represents. The review of the health requirement and associated procedures to date has resulted in amendment of the Migration Regulations to allow for these circumstances to be balanced against the use of community resources in short supply where the applicant is likely to prejudice the access of Australian residents to the resources.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)Not accepted. The Medicare card has no status in law and was never intended to be an identification card but merely an administrative mechanism to facilitate payment of benefit. Further, Medicare benefits are payable to the person who incurs the expense and not the card holder who has no particular status over other persons on the card apart from being the person to whom any general Medicare correspondence is directed.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. The intent of the recommendation to limit access to Medicare by certain classes of temporary residents can be achieved with minimal delay by varying the orders made under section 6 of the Health Insurance Act 1973.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DRAFT AMENDMENT NO 12 OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (RUSSELL MASTER PLAN)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Draft Amendment 12 (Russell) was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on 16 August 1994. The Committee's Report was tabled in Parliament on 5 June 1995. This Draft Amendment of the National Capital Plan proposes a Master Plan for Russell which, among other things, creates a framework for the Department of Defence Russell Redevelopment Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Draft Amendment provides: a revision of figure 12 of the National Capital Plan showing the permitted land uses in Russell; a new statement of Land Use Policy for Russell; and, a new appendix that includes the Russell Master Plan as detailed conditions of planning, design and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations and Government Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the line of the National Triangle be completed and that the extension of Kings Avenue from Russell Drive through Sir Thomas Blamey Square to the roundabout at the apex of the National Triangle proceed. However, the area from the southern end of Sir Thomas Blamey Square to the roundabout at the apex of the National Triangle must be closed to motorised traffic and constructed as a people's gathering place and pedestrian thoroughfare. In order to facilitate the movement of pedestrians between the apex and Sir Thomas Blamey Square, the proposed local road between buildings RN1 and RN2 crossing the northern end of Sir Thomas Blamey Square should not proceed beyond the eastern side of building G and western side of building F.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The layout proposed through Sir Thomas Blamey Square will be amended so that the area from the southern end of the Square to the roundabout at the apex of the triangle shows a landscaped and paved area instead of vehicular carriageways. Detailed design for the area immediately north of Sir Thomas Blamey Square to and including the apex will be prepared in 1995/1996 for construction in line with Department of Defence requirements for occupation of buildings RN1 and RN2. Design work associated with the Square will be undertaken to coincide with Department of Defence's staging of refurbishment works to buildings F and G, and in line with the need to ensure that the work does ". . . not preclude a wide range of development options should a new northern gateway to Canberra be considered at a future date." (Refer Recommendation 3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the National Capital Planning Authority in consultation with the ACT government design and implement measures to reduce traffic problems at the intersection of Parkes Way, Kings Avenue and Morshead Drive as part of the redevelopment of Russell.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed in principle.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Russell Redevelopment Project will result in only a small increase in employment at Russell, as the majority of the project involves replacing and refurbishing existing office space.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Draft Amendment provides that commonwealth offices, other than for occupation by the Department of Defence, will not be approved until a review of the Employment Location Policies of the National Capital Plan has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Draft Amendment for Russell does not depend at this time on the implementation of any traffic improvements at the intersection of Parkes Way, Kings Avenue and Morshead Drive. The longer term development of Russell should not, however, proceed until traffic problems at the junction of Parkes Way, Kings Avenue and Morshead Drive have been reduced. It is noted that the intersection is on territory Land rather than National Land and implementation of any improvements would be the responsibility of the ACT government. Accordingly, the NCPA will consult with the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the detailed design, planning and construction for the proposed redevelopment of Russell not preclude a wide range of development options should a new northern gateway to Canberra be considered at a future time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the excavation of the cutting into Mount Pleasant as proposed in the Russell Offices Redevelopment Project proceed, providing this cutting is limited to a maximum of eight metres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed in part. </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the committee held its hearing the cutting has been the subject of more detailed design and discussion between the NCPA, Defence and the ACT Department of Urban Services. As a result the cutting has been reshaped to produce a benched effect. At its maximum depth the cutting will be 11 metres, with the maximum depth of the exposed cut face being 8 metres. The remaining three metres will be grassed and the reshaping will blend the cutting into the existing topography.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that planning for future roads should not be predicated on the demolition of existing buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed in part.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Draft Amendment represents a long-term concept as well as comprising a statement of current planning intent. It is important that the Draft Amendment does not preclude the future extension of Constitution Avenue at its full width, nor the desirability of the proposed road connecting at the apex of the National Triangle to Morshead Drive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only new road reservations proposed to be specified on the Amendment are those which can be achieved within the proposed Defence Redevelopment program, with the exception of the proposed extension of Constitution Avenue which crosses the edge of Building A. However, even this building can be accommodated for the foreseeable future with a staged construction of the road. The other roads are proposed to be shown on the plan as indicative only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Russell Master Plan is intended to be implemented in stages. It allows the buildings to remain for the term of their economic life and for decisions about their refurbishment or demolition to be made in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the National Capital Planning Authority accepts responsibility for setting out the detailed conditions of planning, design and development for public transport routes and infrastructure on national roads, and where appropriate, consult with the ACT Authority responsible for the ACT Territory Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the proposed detailed amendment to the Indicative Layout diagram showing pedestrian and cycle routes be completed by the end of 1995. Further, the committee recommends that the revised Indicative Layout diagram be advertised in the Commonwealth Gazette and in the principal daily newspaper published and circulated in the territory as stated in the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, for public comment before finalisation of the plan and design of pedestrian and cycle routes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed in part.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is agreed that the Indicative Layout Diagram should show proposed pedestrian and cycle routes, but only the major routes and these not in any detailed sense. The Indicative Layout Diagram essentially presents only the design concept underlying the possible long-term layout and development of Russell and any changes to the Diagram should remain consistent with that intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Draft Amendment will be altered as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principles for Roads and Parking set out in the Draft Amendment at page 9 of the Master Plan, will be renamed "Traffic and Parking" and be augmented to indicate that cycleways and pedestrian paths, where separate from the local road systems, will provide safe and convenient movement generally within open space and connect with major peripheral paths.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that, in preparing the detailed design and plan of any car parking structures, consideration be given to constructing some of the planned levels of car parking below ground level so that such structures are not built to, or near, maximum height, thereby dominating much of the precinct's environment.5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreed in principle.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration will be given to minimising the height and visual impact of car parking structures. However, the extra cost of basement level parking may discourage the building of parking structures and act against the primary objective of progressively removing surface parking. The height of parking structures should be determined by the contribution each structure makes to the urban design principle of emphasising the natural terrain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 11</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that a sufficient number of parking structures be appropriately planned, designed and constructed to meet the demands of the growing workforce at Russell and within the principle of replacing surface car parking facilities for long stay parking.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national companies and securities scheme laws were introduced by the Government in 1989 to enable the Commonwealth to assume national responsibility for the regulation of companies and the securities markets, and implement a regime that would meet the needs of the Australian economy into the 1990's and beyond. The Government recognised that our economy is national, with companies operating across the country and often in the international sphere. To divide the regulation of companies on the lines of State and Territory boundaries, as existed under the former co-operative companies and securities scheme, meant that there was no Parliament, no Government and no Minister with overall responsibility and accountability for the operation of the scheme. The co-operative scheme had, by that time, outlived its usefulness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chief among the new administrative organs established by the national scheme laws was the ASC, which replaced the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) and assumed responsibility for the administration of the scheme.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers given to the ASC by the legislature were designed to ensure that it was able to be a strong and effective regulatory body, yet one which was flexible and responsive to developments in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NCSC had operated under a regime of ordinary and special investigations. The power of the NCSC to conduct compulsory oral examinations was reserved for special investigations only. Special investigations required the consent of either an individual State or Northern Territory Minister, or of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. For the most part, consent was to be granted only if the Minister or the Ministerial Council considered it to be in the public or national interest.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like its predecessors, however, the breaches of corporate law that the ASC is called on to investigate are often extremely complex. Commercial arrangements frequently have an appearance of legitimacy. They are commonly highly structured and involve hundreds of individual transactions and thousands of documents. Professional advisers including lawyers, accountants, tax advisers and merchant bankers are used at all stages of the arrangements. Transactions often involve interstate and international activities and may be effected through the use of electronic technology. The arrangements often involve complex corporate structures or groups with interlinked shareholdings or debts, some of which may be incorporated or have assets outside Australia, often in jurisdictions which do not have cooperative arrangements with Australia for sharing information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the timely and thorough examination of such transactions is essential to the effective enforcement of Australia's corporate laws and, ultimately, the maintenance of investor confidence in Australia's securities markets. To this end the legislature considered it necessary to equip the corporate regulator with effective investigatory powers. It is the exercise of those powers by the ASC that is the subject of review by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consideration of the Report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's inquiry commenced at a time when the ASC had only been operating some 3 years. Since it commenced operation on 1 January 1991, the ASC has grown from a skeleton staff to over 1600 employees. It has regional offices in each State and Territory as well as 12 business centres, an information processing centre in Traralgon and policy and administrative offices in Melbourne and Sydney.  It has successfully, in that time, achieved a significant presence as a truly national regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless such significant growth can, not unexpectedly, reveal some deficiencies in the administrative practices of a large decentralised organisation. The Committee has recommended that the ASC adopt a number of administrative and funding measures to improve its investigatory practices. The Government supports each of those recommendations. The Government also notes that, in so far as these recommendations relate to internal ASC procedures, they either reflected the ASC's current practice at the time of the Report or have since been adopted by the ASC. Recommendations in this category are recommendations 2, 3, 6, 9 and 13.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has also made a number of recommendations for minor changes to the national companies and securities scheme laws under which the ASC operates. Recommendations in this category are recommendations 1, 5, 7, 8 and 11. The Government also supports each of these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining five recommendations made by the Committee address a number of fundamental issues going to the heart of the powers the ASC can exercise to facilitate an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee specifically recognises that any examination of the investigative powers of the ASC needs to address the balance which should be struck between two competing interests: the need for effective corporate regulation and the need to protect individuals from an excess of administrative power. The Government is concerned to ensure that in re-examining that balance, the investigatory powers of the ASC are not so diminished as to render the Commission completely ineffective as a corporate regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the Government is not convinced that significant changes to the ASC's powers are warranted at this time, particularly given the comparatively short time the ASC has had to establish itself in the complex arena of corporate regulation. Much of the anecdotal evidence presented to the Committee related to one or two investigations undertaken by the Commission shortly after its establishment. The administrative changes recommended by the Committee, many of which, as already noted, have been implemented by the ASC, should overcome many of the problems identified with the handling of those particular investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report does not, in the Government's view, reveal any fundamental deficiencies in the ASC's exercise of its investigatory powers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 92 of the ASC Law protects informants from civil liability for defamation and breach of confidentiality, but only where the ASC has exercised its statutory powers under Part 3 of the ASC Law. Thus persons served with a notice under section 19 of the ASC Law, compulsorily requiring their appearance for examination, receive the statutory protection afforded by section 92. While the statutory powers of the ASC under Part 3 of the ASC Law may be exercised once a formal investigation has commenced under section 13 of the ASC law, a formal investigation cannot commence until the ASC has "reason to suspect" that a contravention had taken place. Those persons who volunteer information of possible misfeasance, for example in circumstances where a formal investigation has not commenced, will not receive the statutory protection of section 92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly relevant to professional advisers who may, by volunteering that information, be in breach of confidentiality obligations imposed upon them. In the absence of the statutory protection afforded by section 92, informants must rely on common law principles to protect them from civil liability for their disclosures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes that the benefit of such a statutory protection for informants, on this occasion directors and others involved in the compliance activities of collective investment schemes, was also identified by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee Report "Collective Investments:  Other People's Money" (Report No 65) (1993) Volume 1 at page 156.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government sees a benefit in encouraging persons to volunteer information to the ASC and agrees with the Committee that it would be desirable to extend the statutory protection presently afforded by section 92 to those persons voluntarily and in good faith providing information to or at the request of the ASC.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes the Committee's recommendation for a statutory right to recover damages from the ASC in circumstances where an ex parte order freezing assets under section 1323 of the Corporations Law obtained by the ASC is subsequently lifted without a determinative order being made against the subject property and no successful criminal or civil prosecution has resulted against the respondent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC's power to apply to the Court for an order freezing assets, to prevent the possible or further misappropriation of assets, is an important means of ensuring that assets are available to satisfy subsequent civil recovery proceedings or to avoid the need for such proceedings at all. The ASC may apply for an order under section 1323 where:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an investigation is being carried out under the Corporations Law or the ASC Law (paragraph 1323(1)(a));</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers of the Court under section 1323 include the freezing of payments and the taking or sending of money, securities, futures contracts or other property out of the jurisdiction; the appointment of a receiver or trustee to the property of a natural person; the appointment of a receiver or a receiver and manager over corporate property; requiring that a person surrender his or her passport and prohibiting a person leaving Australia without the consent of the Court. The capacity to appoint a receiver is arguably the most valuable and versatile of the court's powers under section 1323. It is unlikely, however, that a final order, freezing the assets of the defendant, would be made on the basis of an ex parte hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More commonly, the ASC may apply for the grant of an interim order and, in an exceptional case, that application for an interim order could proceed ex parte. Such a case would be one where the practical utility of the orders being sought may be prejudiced by advance notice of the ASC's intentions allowing, for example, concealment of those assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 1323(4) relieves the ASC from the usual requirement to give an undertaking as to damages, but it does so only in respect of applications for interim orders. The exemption for such orders encourages urgent applications by the ASC in circumstances where, for example, an investigation has only just commenced, but where urgent action is necessary to preserve assets that may be in danger of being dissipated once the investigation becomes known. Were the ASC to be required to give an undertaking as to damages it would detract from the ASC's ability to take speedy action and thus restrict what has otherwise become a critical part of the ASC's enforcement strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases where regulatory action has not been possible before perpetrators have transferred assets offshore, the prospects of subsequently securing those asserts have been, generally speaking, low. Notwithstanding significant advances in the level of co-operation between regulatory authorities, co-operation that is advanced by such legislative developments as the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992, it is still the case that in certain overseas jurisdictions it is virtually impossible to trace assets and secure orders requiring the return of that property. By contrast, the ASC has had considerable success in a number of cases where it was able to move early to secure assets pursuant to section 1323. Such assets have subsequently been made available to pay creditors or, in some cases, investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC, as the corporate regulator, will not be motivated by the same factors as a private litigant in seeking such orders. The ASC is bound to consider, in addition to the prospects of success in preserving assets, the likely effect of the action on compliance with the law generally. The ASC is not motivated by the desire to preserve those assets for its own benefit, as is a private litigant, but for the benefit of shareholders and creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes the Committee concedes at paragraphs 0.20 and 5.20 that ex parte applications under section 1323 are sometimes necessary due to the reality of swift movements of money in the corporate world, but that it is of the view the law, as it presently stands, does not provide any incentives for caution in the use of the ex parte procedure and that there is a capacity for innocent persons to suffer loss and damage without any right to compensation for the loss suffered. In reaching this view the Committee appears to have assumed that the ASC has a policy of proceeding ex parte, or at least needs some special incentive to exercise caution in using that procedure. However, in fact the ASC uses the ex parte procedure sparingly, and in practice the circumstances in which it has proceeded ex parte have been, and should be, exceptional.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges that the current provisions of the Corporations Law providing for interim freezing orders are widely drafted, but notes that there are other incentives for caution on the part of the ASC. These include the availability of the sanction of costs orders to be made against the ASC where the ASC is unable to sustain its claim. The courts have a discretion to award costs against the ASC if it is satisfied that the ASC has in some way acted unreasonably or not prosecuted its claim with due diligence. The costs of the interim receiver may also be borne by the ASC: ASC v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 11 ACSR 137.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the absence of an undertaking as to damages is a matter that a court could take into account when weighing the balance of convenience in making the interim order sought by the ASC, particularly where the application proceeds ex parte. Further, where an order is obtained by the ASC as the result of an ex parte hearing it is the common practice of the court to allow  the order to run for a very  limited period only. During that period the court requires that the defendant be served and afforded the opportunity to be represented at a further hearing, held at the earliest possible date, to determine whether the order should be varied, discharged or continued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also notes that the provisions of subsection 1323(4) are not unique. Subsection 80(6) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 exempts the Trade Practices Commission from being required to give an undertaking as to damages where the Commission applies for an injunction to restrain breaches or attempted breaches of the restrictive trade practices and consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the circumstances, the Government is not satisfied that the existing fetters on the grant of interim orders under subsection 1323(4) to the ASC are inadequate and, in view of its concern to ensure that the ASC is encouraged to act without delay to secure assets in the interests of investors and creditors, does not agree with the Committee's recommendation. Nevertheless, the Government does see some merit in ensuring that the procedures governing the grant of interim orders under section 1323, where those orders are obtained following an ex parte hearing, operate uniformly across all jurisdictions. Thus the Government proposes to amend section 1323 to provide that where an interim order is obtained as a result of an ex parte hearing, that order is returnable on a day within 21 days of the making of the order or, in exceptional circumstances, such further date as is determined by the Court. Within that period the ASC will be required to effect service on the defendant and the defendant will be entitled to appear on the return date and make application for the order to be discharged or varied.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">62.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that the statutory onus to be placed on the ASC should reflect that </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">developed by the case law, namely that the ASC be required to establish to the court's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief on the inspector's part that to allow the representation will, or is likely to, prejudice the investigation. The case law has not attempted to limit the circumstances which may give rise to such a reasonable belief and the Government believes it would be counterproductive to attempt to define legislatively the particular circumstances in which an inspector may form such a reasonable belief, because of the wide variety of circumstances that arise in the course of an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">63.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee states at paragraph 7.34 of its report its view that the only real grounds for exclusion are that the lawyer's involvement amounts to a conflict of interest in relation to his or her previous representation of other examinees, or due to prior professional involvement in the corporate structures under investigation. While the Government agrees that these circumstances are those that most commonly would give rise to a concern or belief in the mind of an ASC inspector that the presence of the particular lawyer may prejudice the investigation, the Government does not agree that it would be appropriate to state those circumstances in the legislation and thereby restrict the inspector's ability to exclude a particular lawyer if other circumstances justified that course.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">64.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government agrees with the recommendation of the Committee that the transcript of an examinee's compulsory oral examination be provided promptly and as of right, subject to the qualifications detailed in relation to recommendation 5 above that the ASC retain its existing right in paragraph 24(2)(a) to require an examinee to read and sign the transcript and if the ASC decides that it is inadvisable to supply the transcript, because to do so would prejudice the investigation or endanger the privacy of the examination, then the witness should be given advice in writing to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 12</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the ASC Law be amended so that summonses for the section 19 examination should be issued by the District Registrar of the Federal Court on the application of the ASC. The summons should issue where the District Registrar is satisfied that the examinee can give information relevant to a matter that the ASC is investigating, or is to investigate, under Division 1 of the ASC Act. The issue and application in this instance should be able to be done electronically if there is a need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">65.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes the Committee's comparison of the ASC's examination power under section 19 of the ASC Law with the examination procedure under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966. However, with respect, the Government submits that the comparison of these 2 procedures is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">66.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The examination procedure under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the public examination of a bankrupt or persons associated with the bankrupt, before the Registrar or the Court, by a creditor, the trustee of the bankrupt's estate or the Official Receiver (when he or she is not the trustee of the estate). An application to summons a person for examination under section 81 must be made to the Registrar or the Court, and the Registrar or the Court has a discretion whether or not to issue the summons. Registrars usually handle the applications for examinations and they also preside at the examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">67.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, the examination procedure under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act is comparable with the examination procedure under section 597 of the Corporations Law. Under section 597 of the Corporations Law, persons who may be able to provide information or assistance in an insolvency administration can be the subject of an examination before the Court. An application for the issue of a summons to a person to appear for examination may be made by a liquidator, provisional liquidator or administrator of a company; an administrator of a deed of company arrangement; the ASC or a person authorised by the ASC. The summonsing of company officers by the Court for examination is mandatory under section 596A. However, the Court has a discretion under section 596B whether or not to summons persons other than officers of the company for examination. Such an application is to be supported by affidavit evidence (subsection 596C(1))but that affidavit is not available for inspection unless the Court orders otherwise (subsection 596C(2)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">68.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments to the section 597 examination procedure were made by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992. That Act implemented a number of the recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in the report on its `General Insolvency Inquiry' (known as `the Harmer Report'). In the opinion of the Harmer Report, "[t]he chief purposes of such examinations [in both bankruptcy and company insolvency law] are to facilitate the recovery of property, to discover whether conduct of the insolvent led to the insolvency and to investigate possible causes of action against third parties"(1)  The Harmer Report continued:  ". . . it should be acknowledged that the principal purpose of the examination provisions [namely the section 81 and section 597 examination procedures] should be the discovery of information which will assist in the administration of the estate. The interests of `public policy' in prosecuting criminal offences, though important, are in this context secondary"(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">69.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the chief purpose of examinations under section 19 of the ASC Law is to facilitate the investigation by the ASC of suspected contraventions of a national scheme law; contraventions of any other State or Territory law concerning the management or affairs of a body corporate; or any fraud or dishonesty relating to a body corporate, securities or futures contract(3). To commence an investigation under subsection 13(1) of the ASC Law the ASC or its delegate must have "reason to suspect" that one or more contraventions of a national scheme law or a relevant State or Territory law may have been committed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">70.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the circumstances surrounding examinations under section 81 of the Bankruptcy Act and section 597 of the Corporations Law are quite different to those surrounding examinations under section 19 of the ASC Law. By the time a section 81 or section 597 examination is contemplated, the fact of the individual's bankruptcy or corporate insolvency is already in the public arena. In contrast, the existence of an investigation under subsection 13(1) of the ASC Law may not be public knowledge at the time of an examination under section 19 of the ASC Law. The Courts have acknowledged that the premature disclosure of information while investigations were still on foot or the hearing of criminal charges still pending would enable persons to conceal or destroy relevant evidence and otherwise hinder or obstruct any investigation into, or proceedings with respect to, their activities."(4)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">71.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government also notes the Committee's belief that the ASC should be required to file an affidavit in support of its application which would then be available, as a public document, for perusal by any interested party. The premature disclosure of information sufficient to ground the issue of a summons, including the premature disclosure of the lines of inquiry to be followed by the ASC but are which necessarily untested at that time, carries the unavoidable consequence that the identity of persons being examined and the reasons why they are being examined will become public at an early stage of an investigation. This could result in considerable unfairness and prejudice to the individuals concerned as well as having a devastating effect upon the viability of the company. Section 19 examinations commonly involve the affairs and reputation of individuals still active in business. On the other hand, section 81 and section 597 examinations concern the affairs of individuals or companies whose affairs are already under administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">72.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal would also be contrary to the policy reflected in section 127 of the ASC Law that the ASC take all reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of information given to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">73.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One means by which the concerns of the Committee for the greater protection of examinees can be met, however, is by improving the skills of the ASC officers conducting section 19 examinations. As noted in the paragraphs following relating to Recommendation 13 of the Committee's Report, the Government supports the Committee's recommendation that funds be made available for training so that the ASC officers conducting examinations are equipped with a clear understanding of their legislation, the role of natural justice and effective communication skills. The Government notes that the ASC has already made significant efforts to provide appropriate training for its officers in examination skills. While section 19 examinations are only undertaken now by ASC officers with appropriate expertise and training, the Government sees the further enhancement of the skills of those officers as another means of enhancing the protection of examinees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">74.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will formally review the standards of conduct of section 19 examinations in 3 years time to determine whether the anticipated improvement in the protection of examinees has resulted, or whether additional measures to achieve this outcome are warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">75.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the circumstances, the Government is not persuaded that the procedure recommended by the Committee, for the issue of summonses for section 19 examinations by the District Registrar of the Federal Court, on application of the ASC, would be appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">77.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC has advised that it has already made significant efforts to provide appropriate training for officers in examination skills. In April 1995 the ASC ran a 3 day intensive course for 24 senior investigators and lawyers in examination skills training. Other ASC staff undertook the same course in July 1995. The training was conducted in conjunction with the Leo Cussen Institute, a Victorian body which provides professional training to lawyers and is particularly experienced in providing advocacy training. The courses included mock section 19 examinations to generate discussion about common challenges and issues arising out of procedural aspects of section 19 examinations. The mock examinations were video-taped so as to provide an opportunity for peer review of the performance of each participant on such indicators as the structure and content of questions, the relevance of the questions to the fact situation and the examiner's style and demeanour in asking questions. Both courses were conducted on a national basis so that staff from different regional offices of the ASC were able to discuss and compare approaches in their respective offices. The ASC anticipates that the course will be made generally available to regional offices for those officers who have not had the opportunity to attend the national course.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">80.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislature may abrogate the common law privilege and has done so on occasions in the public interest. Examples of legislative abrogation of the privilege include section 155 of the Trade Practices Act, section 68 of the ASC Law and section 597 of the Corporations Law. Section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act also abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination by necessary implication: Stergis v Boucher (1989) 86 ALR 174.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">81.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UK courts have also confirmed that their corporate investigators (the Department of Trade and Industry) may compel the provision of self-incriminating information: R v Selig [1992] 1 WLR 148.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">82.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the abrogation of the privilege in the commercial regulation context is not a recent development. For example, section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act 1883 (Imp) removed the privilege over a century ago. This provision is today reflected in subsection 81(11AA) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Then, as today, the rationale was that because of the especial public interest in the proceeding in which the disclosure was made, the privilege from answering was a grave obstacle to full disclosure(5).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">83.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abrogation of the privilege by subsection 68(1) of the ASC Law for the purposes of examinations by the ASC under section 19 of the ASC Law is, nevertheless, balanced by a use immunity in subsection 68(3) of the ASC Law. The use immunity prevents a person's incriminating oral statement or signed record or incriminating documents produced under compulsion, from being used in evidence against that person in criminal proceedings or proceedings for the imposition of a penalty, other than proceedings for the falsity of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">84.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that it has the balance in section 68 as it presently stands, between the public interest in effective corporate regulation and the more general civil liberties considerations, correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">85.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate crime is unlike conventional crime in a number of respects. The privilege against self-incrimination has operated as a safeguard to protect the poor, the ignorant and the legally unsophisticated.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">86.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A company officer setting up a criminal scheme is able to plan it so as to use a series of apparently unrelated transactions, to act through agents and intermediaries who may be unavailable to investigators or prosecutors, and to build in as many blinds and screens as desired through foreign jurisdictions. If necessary, the scheme can leave the perpetrator as the only person with knowledge of facts that, if able to be proved, show the criminal nature of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">87.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, this is quite a different kind of offence from the more usual form of theft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">88.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the company suffering the loss is an inanimate legal fiction often controlled by the perpetrator, unlike the human victim of theft. There is therefore typically no human victim with direct familiarity with the circumstances&mdash;so that the prosecution is forced to rely on the perpetrator for evidence. For this reason and because of the complexity of many criminal schemes, documentary evidence is also particularly useful. But it is only useful if it can be identified and explained by the perpetrator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">89.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, unlike ordinary theft, the perpetrator has generally exploited the privilege of carrying on business using a limited liability corporate structure and using moneys invested by the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">90.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of these differences the Government considers it inappropriate that an examinee appearing at a compulsory examination before an ASC investigator under section 19 of the ASC Law be entitled to the protection of the common law privilege against self-incrimination that has developed in very different circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">91.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes that section 10 of the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Act 1992 requires that by mid 1997 a review is undertaken of the amendments made by that Act abolishing the derivative use immunity previously available under subsection 68(3) of the ASC Law. The derivative use immunity prevented any incriminating information, document or other thing obtained as a consequence of an incriminating oral statement or signed record, being admitted in evidence against the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">92.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impetus for the amendments in 1992 were the difficulties being faced by the ASC and the DPP in bringing effective prosecutions. The difficulties threatened to defeat the purpose of significant portions of the corporations legislation. It was clear that in strongly contested cases the onus would rest on the prosecution to establish that every item of evidence, or every document which it sought to tender, was not obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of any compulsory process utilised pursuant to the ASC Law or the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">93.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 amendments also largely restored the law relating to the privilege against self incrimination to the position that obtained under the former Companies Code, namely that examinees were entitled to the protection of use immunity but not derivative use immunity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">95.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government notes the criticisms made to the Committee of the requirement that the privilege be asserted before each answer in question. The law as it presently stands requires an examinee to give serious consideration to whether it is appropriate to claim the privilege in relation to each question and the answer to that question that the examinee is about to give. In practice, however, many examinees will claim the privilege almost as a matter of form before answering each and every question.

A majority of the High Court in CAC (NSW) v Yuill (1991) 4 ACSR 624 found a statutory intention to abrogate the entitlement of a client to claim legal professional privilege and held that a client could not claim the privilege to refuse to produce books or answer questions at a special examination under section 295 of the Companies Code.

As well, the two delegations to China and the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation's visit this year to Vietnam have succeeded in establishing dialogue on a number of issues of mutual concern, including that of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also gives a high priority to encouraging the establishment and strengthening of national human rights institutions in countries in the region. Through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Australia has provided a substantial degree of cooperation and technical assistance on national human rights institutions to a number of countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea. As well, the Government has contributed $300,000 to the UN Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation for the purpose of strengthening the domestic infrastructures which support human rights and, in particular, national human rights machinery in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has long supported the development of Asia-Pacific human rights arrangements which would complement the UN human rights machinery and national institutions established in a number of countries in the region for the promotion and protection of human rights. In this context, the Government has been, over recent years, in consultation with other governments on the prospects for a structured dialogue, which might eventually extend to regular meetings at a ministerial level. The Asia-Pacific is the only region of the world which is still without such an arrangement. The Government believes a regional arrangement would foster greater understanding, cooperation and maintenance of universal human rights principles amongst the diverse and varied social systems and cultures in the Asia-Pacific. The Government's experience on this subject suggests that although there is interest by many countries of the region in closer cooperation on human rights some of them are not ready to formalise this and that further work will be required before such an arrangement could be set in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To advance work on a regional arrangement, three UN-sponsored meetings have been held, in Manila in 1990, Jakarta in 1993 and Seoul in 1994. At the meeting in Seoul, while there was no consensus on the establishment&mdash;of a formal regional mechanicism there was a general desire that discussions should continue. A resolution supporting regional activity was introduced by the Republic of Korea and supported by Australia at the 1995 session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and was adopted by consensus. At a meeting of national human rights institutions held in Manila in April this year, participants, who represented national institutions not governments, affirmed their support for regional cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Government considers the strengthening of the networks that are developing between national commissions in the region will assist in the establishment of a regional human rights body.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that the US budgetary process will have a dramatic impact on funding to UN specialised agencies, the UN regular budget and its peace keeping operations. The Government is also concerned that current US domestic fiscal pressures will mean that the US will not address its significant arrears. Appropriate opportunities have been taken over the last year to register these concerns with the Administration and the US Congress. Mr. Bilney, as acting Foreign Minister, wrote to key US Congressmen noting Australia's concerns relating to declining aid volumes. In our representations we have emphasised that our concern is not the United States' internal budgetary processes but the global impact of significant reductions in foreign relations expenditure, and the need to ensure a strong US presence across the multilateral system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prospect of significant US funding shortfalls is focusing agencies on reform measures and presents a possible opportunity to pursue with increased determination the reform of the UN and its specialised agencies. US funding shortfalls may convince secretariats and member States of the need for closer adherence to mandates and prioritisation of work programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As of 31 May 1995, member States owed the UN an overall total of USD2.8 billion (US arrears were USD1.2 million).

The UN Secretary-General noted in his statement to last year's session of the UN's General Assembly (UNGA49), and repeated subsequently on 22 June this year, that the financial crisis of the UN was threatening its ability to carry out its major functions, including peace keeping and other programs and activities funded from the regular budget.

At the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Australia argued strongly for the United Nations to devote the financial resources necessary for strengthening human rights activities. Since then, Australia has continued to argue in the UN Commission on Human Rights and at the UN General Assembly, for a greater proportion of the UN budget to be devoted to human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to increased financial resources for UN human rights machinery, the Government has strongly encouraged the UN to provide the administrative, managerial and staff resources required by the UN Centre for Human Rights to carry out its core functions as the focal point for the human rights activities of the UN, and has supported reform efforts currently underway in the Centre. Australia has urged the Centre for Human Rights to strengthen its management so that it can operate more efficiently and effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was set up in 1994 to develop coordination between the various UN agencies on human rights as well as to integrate human rights activities in peace keeping and humanitarian assistance operations.

The first incumbent, Mr. Jose Ayala Lasso, visited Australia in April 1995 as a guest of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the high priority the Government places on the need to ensure that adequate resources are made available for strengthening the operation of the UN human rights system and the importance of effective national human rights institutions, the Government has provided financial support to the UN for the creation of the position of Special Adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on National Human Rights Institutions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criteria for membership of UN human rights committees established pursuant to the key UN human rights instruments are contained within each instrument. In summary, the instruments stipulate that committees should be made up of experts of high moral standing and competence in fields covered by the Conventions and elected by States parties from amongst their nationals. Experts are to serve in their personal capacity but consideration should also be given to equitable geographic distribution and principal legal systems. Alteration of this committee structure would require amendment of individual instruments. Opening for negotiation previously agreed language is an uncertain process and could result in amendments that would limit rather than enhance committee independence. In addition, amendment of UN conventions is time-consuming and expensive due to the requirement to consult widely and thoroughly amongst member States of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the view of the Australian Government that efforts should be focused on ensuring that membership criteria are adhered to rather than revising the present committee structure. To this end, Australia carefully scrutinises each application for membership to UN human rights committees to ensure that high quality candidates are selected for vacant positions. In addition, Australia advocates and promotes the continual strengthening of the international human rights system of which the human rights treaty committees are an integral element. The Government does not agree that membership of the Human Rights Committee should be confined to experts elected by States parties which have signed the First (Optional) Protocol. This would require amendment of the International Covenant on Cultural and Political Rights (ICCPR), raising the problems set out above. It is the view of the Australian Government that the existing guidelines for membership of the Human Rights Committee are appropriate and that efforts should be concentrated on ensuring the guidelines are adhered to in electing committee members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Limiting membership of the Human Rights Committee by the method suggested would elevate the complaints mechanism above other key functions of the Committee, including the consideration of reports on measures adopted and progress made by States in achieving observance of the rights enshrined in the Covenant. Moreover, States which have not ratified the First (Optional) Protocol may be reluctant to participate in the reporting process if they were not able to nominate their nationals for election to the Committee. Membership of other human rights committees is not limited to those which have agreed to be bound by the complaints mechanism contained within the instrument.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government took action to meet its obligations under Article 4(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination (CERD) by introducing legislation addressing the incitement of racial hatred. Article 4(a) states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work on redrafting racial vilification legislation was completed in 1994 following community), consultations held in 1993 to gauge public reaction to the Racial Vilification Bill 1992, which lapsed following the proroguing of Parliament on the calling of the March 1993 Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The redrafted legislation&mdash;the Racial Hatred Bill 1994&mdash;originated in three major inquiries which found gaps in the protection provided by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence, The Australian Law Reform Commission Report into Multiculturalism and the Law, and The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all favoured an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Racial Hatred Bill was intended to close a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour, and to provide a safety net for racial harmony in Australia as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Racial Hatred Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 16 November 1994. It was introduced to the Senate on 28 November 1994 and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for report by 7 March 1995. In the Committees's report, the majority recommended that the Bill be enacted as introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill as introduced to the Parliament sought to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences. However, the criminal offence provisions were deleted by the Senate during the Committee stages of debate on 24 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining provisions of the Bill were passed without amendment by the Senate. They created a civil prohibition against racial hatred by inserting new sections 18B to 18E into the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to make it unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the act is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 31 August 1995 , the Government agreed to accept the Senate's amendments so that Australians gained the benefit of the remaining provisions of the Bill. Importantly this&mdash;provides an avenue of complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is a vast improvement for people in States or Territories that currently have no such avenues of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Racial Hatred Act (No 101 of 1995) came into effect on 13 October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government remains convinced of the need for appropriate remedies in the criminal law to deal with extreme racist behaviour. It therefore, will go to the next election firmly committed to the introduction of another Bill to include such protection in the Crimes Act 1914 in the next Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enactment of the criminal sanctions would enable Australia to withdraw its current reservation to Article 4(a) of CERD. The reservation is as follows:</PARA>

In this regard the Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended in its report, Equality Before the Law Women's Equality, that the Government enact equality legislation which would benefit both women and men. Initially, the legislation would take the form of an ordinary Act of Parliament, the long-term goal being entrenchment of the Equality Act in the Constitution. This proposal focuses primarily on providing for equality in law, which should be defined to include equality before the law, equality under the law, equal protection of the law, equal benefit of the law and the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WTO agreement establishes a non-discriminatory multilateral system of trade rules and obligations. The achievements made through its forerunner, the GATT, and in particular through the Uruguay Round of negotiations, were considerable. Insofar as trade liberalisation has resulted in rises in levels of development and standards of living, the GATTWTO has contributed to the better observance of economic and social rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of further discussion of trade and labour standards in the WTO has been raised by the United States and some European countries. The Government stands ready to contribute to such discussion in the WTO, but remains concerned that any links between labour standards and trade rules and obligations are not used for protectionist purposes, and do not create a North-South divide in the international trading system. In particular the Government is concerned about:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the question of GATT/WTO competency to deal with non-trade issues, especially in areas where consensus is unlikely;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, debate over a social clause may derogate from immediate priorities, including bedding down Uruguay Round commitments, managing the transition from the GATT to the WTO and completing negotiations on services, intellectual property and GATT accessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, concern over the effects of globalization on labour standards is widespread. The ILO has recognised that there is a link between trade liberalisation and social progress. The ILO has consequently established a Working Party on the Social Dimensions of the Liberalisation of Trade to consider ways in which the opportunities afforded by economic growth can be used to promote the adoption and implementation of ILO standards and to strengthen the effectiveness of the ILO's activities. The Government has supported this development in the ILO, as well as a study underway in the OECD on trade and labour standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will continue to look to the ILO as the principle and preferred international body for strengthening observance of labour standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, the Government has established a Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards to explore measures, including possible trade-related measures, which could be taken to promote labour standards in the Asia-Pacific Region. The Working Party is chaired by the Hon Michael Duffy MP and is expected to report in late 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WTO has 100 members at present, and another 56 GATT contracting parties are expected to join. Almost all are also members of the ILO, which has 171 members, and of the UN, which has 185 members. Membership of WTO is clearly not incompatible with membership of the ILO and other international rights agencies and agreements. Major studies are currently underway in the ILO and OECD on trade and labour standards.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government, along with 179 other nations, endorsed the Program of Action (POA) of the UN International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994. The POA establishes the framework within which multilateral and bilateral population assistance programs operate and emphasises that coercion has no place in family planning programs. Such programs must be based on the right of individuals and couples to decide freely and responsibly on the size and spacing of their family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is opposed to the exercise of coercion in family planning programs. In developing countries such as China, we seek to demonstrate the benefits of voluntarism in family planning programs through Australian aid projects. The Chinese authorities have agreed that the principle of voluntarism will be upheld in our aid activities. For example, the Ningxia Family Planning, Women's and Children's Health project is safeguarded by an agreement with the Chinese authorities that coercive practices will not take place in the area of project activity. Thorough monitoring by the Embassy ensures that this agreement is upheld. In addition, in relation to China, a number of representations have been made on the issue of coercion and will continue to be made, including in the context of human rights delegations such as those Australia has sent to China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government makes bilateral representations to recipient countries to emphasise the efficacy of family planning services based on the principles agreed in the POA. Australia monitors the performance of the multilateral population agencies in this regard through our participation at governing board meetings, and liaison as appropriate at country level. AusAID maintains close contact with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Beijing and seeks to reinforce UNFPA's commitment to combating the use of coercion in China's family planning programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary goals of population assistance are to improve women's health and status and to contribute to sustainable development and the alleviation of poverty.

The fund was established by the Secretary-General in November 1994 and its purpose is to provide special and additional resources for urgent mine clearance operations. Australia also announced a further $3.6 million in 1995-96 for bilateral demining activities, the bulk of which will be channelled through UN agencies with existing programs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is committed to the elimination of all anti-personnel landmines as an ultimate goal. But in the absence of widespread international support for an absolute ban, at least pending the development of viable and humane alternatives, it will continue to make sense to pursue lesser, but still eminently worthwhile, practical solutions to begin to reverse the appalling problems created by the proliferation and misuse of these weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, the Government supported a UN General Assembly resolution adopted by consensus, that affirmed "the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines as viable and humane alternatives are developed". At present, however, landmines, like other conventional weapons, are regarded by most States parties to the Inhumane Weapons Convention (IWC) as a legitimate weapon when used responsibly and only against potential enemy combatant forces in times of armed conflict. Today's problems are due to the misuse of landmines, and what makes this misuse so reprehensible is that mines continue to kill and maim long after conflict is over. The Government's approach is focused on achieving concrete results which would have a practical effect in saving lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that simply advocating a total ban now offers an effective and realistic response to the pressing problems that the indiscriminate use of landmines is causing now for communities in many parts of the world. From discussions we have had, in particular as part of the diplomatic activity leading up to the Review Conference of the IWC, it has become apparent that adequate international support for an immediate and total ban does not exist at present. There are only nine countries which, ostensibly and in principle, support a total ban. They are Austria, Belgium, Cambodia, Colombia, Estonia, Ireland, Mexico, Norway and Sweden (of which Cambodia, Colombia and Estonia are not members of the IWC). Few of these countries have abolished their stocks of anti-personnel landmines or instructed their armed forces not to use mines. Further, most have significant qualifications to their positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until humane and viable alternatives are developed, the creation of a sufficiently broad international consensus favouring a total ban remains unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the international leadership role which Australia has adopted in pursuing a ban on non-detectable and non-self-destructing/self-deactivating mines, and pursuing increased participation in the IWC represents a practical and productive approach to the landmine problem at the present time, while meeting legitimate security concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mines are a unique type of defensive weapon. For Australia&mdash;with a vast amount of territory to defend with a very small force-the task of defending Australia, and in particular, of protecting vital installations in a conflict, would be more difficult if the ADF were denied the use of all types of anti-personnel landmines. Mines represent a threat, an obstacle or a delay, which decreases the mobility and manoeuvre opportunities for an opponent and reduces the number of troops needed for the defence of an area or a facility. For Australia, with vital forward operating bases and important surveillance facilities in remote parts of the continent, this latter role is particularly important. The Department of Defence has looked at this issue in detail and concluded that while long lived mines were not essential in modern warfare or to defend Australia, there is no doubt that the ADF would be significantly disadvantaged if it were unable to use short lived anti-personnel mines. This would risk Australian lives, threaten the success of our military operations, risk prolonging the conflict, and threaten Australian security. And the dangers would be even higher if the opponent was using mines while the ADF, through a unilateral decision to support a total ban, could not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is therefore of the view that, in the absence of widespread international support for an absolute ban at the present time, the misuse of landmines by some groups or countries should not result in their denial to responsible defence forces such as Australia's. Australia of course is a party to the Inhumane Weapons Convention, and the Government takes its obligations under the Convention most seriously. The provisions of the Convention are built into the training and operational doctrine of the Australian Defence Forces. The problem is that the improper use of anti-personnel landmines can cause indiscriminate death and injury, including to non-combatants, long after conflicts have finished. This is the problem which Australia's approach is intended to solve.</PARA>

However, high priority needs to be given to ensuring the safety of victims of violence (mainly women and children) from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the promotion of their right to live free from violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Violence in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is considered a difficult problem to deal with because of its sensitive nature. Violence in all forms, including child abuse and sexual abuse, is often the result of excessive alcohol and drug abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of this, a core component of the Government's Justice Statement is the National Women's Justice Strategy (NWJS). The NWJS is designed to alleviate the barriers women face in gaining access to justice and provides $12.3 million over four years for the establishment of a network of women's legal services. Funding of $5 million over four years will enable the network of women's legal centres to establish specialist services for indigenous women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Women's Justice Strategy responds to key recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission's Equality Before the Law report. In particular, the specialist indigenous women's units reflects the Report's finding that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are the least well served by the legal system and face multiple disadvantages in gaining access to justice and realising equality before the law.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women themselves are victims of the violence which has become common in their communities, often exacerbated by substance abuse, and often fatal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention to involve Aboriginal women and Torres Strait Islander women in the development and delivery of alcohol and substance abuse programs and education initiatives through community planning processes and as parents and workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some communities are attempting to discuss the issue and develop strategies to address the violence which is destroying many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Indigenous women are of the opinion that the issue of violence is a community issue and should be addressed as such. There is concern about involving the police as mediators and addressing the issue of violence with legal action such as restraining and protection orders which is not acceptable to many indigenous women as such action often perpetuates further violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of how the issues surrounding domestic violence is being addressed is contained in a handbook entitled, Through Black Eyes. The handbook evolved from a national workshop convened by the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) in 1992. The workshop was based on reports received by member organisations of SNAICC about the violence in families and its effect on women and children.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are the main victims of domestic and family violence in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and seek special services in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 the Commonwealth responded to a report by the National Committee on Violence by providing funding to ATSIC for the establishment of the NFVIP. The aim of the program was to decrease the incidence of violence in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through raising awareness, training of representatives of communities, and providing on-going support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to address family violence over the course of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program was allocated $4.9m over three and a half years. NFVIP activities are currently operating in all States through Regional Councils and are reported to have widespread community support. The Commonwealth funding for NFVIP ceased on 30 June 1995. ATSIC is funding the program for a further 12 months from its global allocation at a cost of $1.4m. The future of this vital program is uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health and Community Development Branch of ATSIC has recently commissioned a review of the NFVIP and the final report by the consultants was submitted in January 1995. The report outlined problems associated with the establishment of the Program but also identified a number of positive aspects. Options are being considered by ATSIC, in consultation with the Office of the Status of Women and other Commonwealth Departments, as a result of the report.</PARA>

This Act, which will enable Australia to assist and comply with requests from the Tribunal, provides for various forms of assistance, including the taking of evidence in Australia for Tribunal purposes and the surrendering of suspects in Australia to the Tribunal for trial if the Tribunal so requests. This is in addition to Australia's existing extradition network enabling the extradition of a person in Australia to face war crimes charges in a country with which we have an extradition relationship and for which war crimes are extraditable offences, if that country so requested.

In addition, Australia supported the appointment of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Australia supported also the recent establishment by the United Nations of the International War Crimes Tribunal referred to above.

In addition, Rules 71 and 90 provide for evidence to be submitted by way of deposition, that is, testimony given by witnesses who are unable or unwilling to testify subsequently in open court.

To this end, in 1994, the Government approved guidelines to ensure that population related activities offered as part of Australia's aid program protect human rights. In particular, the guidelines ensure that family planning projects funded through the aid program do not force individuals to adopt particular forms of family planning. All population projects funded under the aid program are examined against the guidelines prior to funding being approved. In addition, funding for the multilateral population agencies is conditional upon the agencies providing statements which demonstrate that their programs and policies are consistent with AusAID's guidelines.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has not ratified the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others as we believe that the views expressed on the issue of prostitution are outmoded and because Australia is a party to each of the four international instruments dealing with the traffic of women and children that the 1949 Convention sought to consolidate. (Australia has also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) and supports the establishment of an Optional Protocol to the CROC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The obligations imposed under these more recent international instruments render ratification of the 1949 Convention unnecessary.) While Australia condemns both traffic in persons and the exploitation of prostitution, the 1949 Convention also seeks indirectly to make the practice of prostitution itself illegal which conflicts with trends in Australia towards the legalisation of prostitution. For these reasons it would seem inappropriate for Australia to urge other states to ratify the 1949 Convention.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been declared to be an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purposes of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The effect of the declaration is to extend the statutory functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to issues relating to children. This means that a person can lodge a complaint with HREOC if they consider that there has been a breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government set up the Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards. Its recommendations will be considered carefully as a contribution to the development of Government policy in this area. The possibility of such an international instrument is part of current thinking on possible additional responses to the problem of exploitative child labour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its submission to the Working Party outlined as an option the development of an Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child dealing specifically with trade in the products of exploitative child labour. The development of an Optional Protocol would greatly raise the profile of the problem of exploitative child labour and, if adopted, would strengthen existing international standards. Such an initiative would, however, be a long-term undertaking involving an extensive diplomatic campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of international instruments addressing the question of child exploitation are already in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 20 November 1989. This Convention has been ratified by 175 countries, including Australia (on 17 December 1990).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States that ratify this Convention must, inter alia, protect the child from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to interfere with his or her education or be harmful to his or her health or well-being. Article 32 of the Convention deals with the economic exploitation of children, including child labour. Measures taken by States to implement Article 32, however, are to have regard to the relevant provisions of other international instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ILO has been concerned with the issue of child labour since its inception in 1919. In 1973 the ILO consolidated previous conventions on the subject into a revised convention, Convention 138, the Minimum Age Convention, 1973. Only 46 of the ILO's 175 member States have ratified the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has not ratified Convention 138. The Inter-governmental Task Force established in 1991 to review unratified ILO Conventions and an independent expert have examined in detail the ratification prospects for the Convention. Both enquiries identified significant compliance problems for Australia concerning the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's non-ratification of Convention 138 has been due to the different approaches adopted to prohibiting work for children below 15 years of age by the Convention, which is highly prescriptive, and by Australian legislation, which provides for compulsory school attendance and child welfare protection. Convention 138 requires legislation fixing the minimum age of not less than 15 years for entry into employment or work. While the Convention allows some exclusions on matters such as artistic performances or light work, the conditions under which these are permissible are quite strict. The Convention deals only with minimum age, and does not recognise that child labour encompasses a wide range of activities, not all of which are considered harmful or exploitative. By contrast, UNICEF has developed a set of criteria to assist in determining when work done by children becomes exploitative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that a Convention on such an important issue has only been ratified by some 46 countries. The ILO, however, is actively promoting observance of the Convention as part of its wider promotion of human rights labour standards in line with the outcomes of the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 to promote respect for basic human rights as embodied in relevant ILO Conventions (including Convention 138).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its follow-up action to the World Summit, the ILO is currently seeking information on the difficulties and obstacles to ratification from those countries which have not ratified Convention 138 and other core human rights conventions. This information will be consolidated into a report for consideration by the ILO Governing Body in November 1995. The ILO Governing Body will also be holding a discussion in its employment committee on a report on child labour prepared by the International Labour Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These ILO activities will provide an opportunity to consider what further action might be possible in terms of either ensuring greater observance or ratification of Convention 138 or whether other options should be pursued. One possible option would be to revise Convention 138. A revised Convention which establishes effective and workable standards and which can be widely ratified would underline the ILO's authority in this field and provide direction for its technical assistance activities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has already begun to raise the profile of labour standards issues within the UN system, is an active member of the ILO, and is engaged in regional and bilateral dialogue and projects aimed at protecting and promoting core labour standards. Australia's efforts in this area involve the Government, unions and industry reflecting our belief that a tripartite approach to the problem is the most effective way of achieving concrete results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The promotion and protection of core labour standards is an integral part of Australia's human rights diplomacy. Within the UN system, the ILO is the key organisation responsible for protecting and promoting core labour standards. The Australian Government strongly supports its role in elaborating, promoting and monitoring international standards as well as its educational, information and technical assistance activities designed to enable countries to implement those standards. The Government considers that the ILO's capacity to monitor standards, identify abuses and ensure better compliance needs to be strengthened and will continue to work towards this end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elsewhere in the UN system, the Government will continue to support, and where appropriate promote, action on labour standards within the human rights machinery (eg, the Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary bodies), working groups and special rapporteurs (eg, those working on contemporary forms of slavery) and the UN specialised agencies and funds (eg, UNICEF).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as working to introduce international standards, the Government is concerned that they are effectively implemented. The realisation of core labour standards is an important development goal and the aid program will seek further appropriate opportunities to protect and promote those standards through bilateral, regional and international programs eg, the Australian Support for ILO Objectives in Asia Project (ASILO), the Project to Support the Development of Departments of Labour in the Pacific (PACLAB) and the ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As outlined in the response to Recommendation 19 above, the Government has reservations about labour standards being raised in the WTO. The issue of whether there are enough trade related interests to warrant further discussion of trade and labour standards in the WTO has been raised by the United States and some European countries. The Government stands ready to contribute to such discussion in the WTO, but remains concerned that any links between labour standards and trade rules and obligations are not used for protectionist purposes, and do not create a North-South divide in the international trading system.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wording of this recommendation raises an issue of definition which needs to be clarified before the substance of the recommendation is addressed. The matter that needs clarification is the use of the word "refugee". The Government does not detain refugees, ie, those who have sought Australia's protection and have been granted a protection visa. It is assumed that the Committee's reference to "refugees" is a reference to unauthorised boat people or asylum claimants in general. The use of the term "refugee" in this context is misleading as it assumes that all boat arrivals/asylum claimants are in fact refugees in terms of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees. Australia does not recognise its asylum claimants, whether or not they arrive by boat, as refugees until their claims under the Convention have been heard and accepted. Once a person's claims are accepted he or she is granted a protection visa and is no longer detained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, asylum seekers who have entered Australia with a visa and are immigration cleared on arrival are not detained. The bridging visa mechanism allows claimants who become unlawful non-citizens to remain at liberty while their claims are assessed. There will be exceptions where an assessment is made that the claimant will not abide by conditions imposed on their bridging visa (such as regular reporting to the department) or where a claimant has already breached conditions of the bridging visa granted. Decisions to refuse a bridging visa are merits reviewable by the Immigration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a long-standing policy of the Government, that unauthorised arrivals usually be detained, irrespective of whether they are asylum claimants. That current policy has been reviewed recently and the Government does not consider that a further specific review is called for. On 27 May 1993, the Senate passed a resolution requesting that the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration (the Committee) conduct an inquiry into immigration detention practices in Australia. The inquiry occurred over a 9 month period and included consultations with community and government representatives. It visited various immigration detention, and reception and processing centres around Australia and held discussions with staff and detainees at those centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report, Asylum, Border Control and Detention, was tabled in Parliament on 2 March 1994. In this report the Committee supported the broad thrust of Australia's existing immigration detention policy, but recommended that modifications be introduced to guard against prolonged detention of asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasised that Australia must retain its sovereign right to determine who may enter, the conditions under which a non-citizen's entry may be permitted, and the circumstances under which a non-citizen may be permitted to stay or may be removed from Australia. The Committee determined that Australia's system of immigration control, which supports Australia's important migration program, must be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry the Committee considered a number of options presented to it for the release into the community of asylum seekers. In reaching their recommendations the Committee took account of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the evidence that among those persons who reside in the community while their refugee claims are determined, a significant percentage disappear into the community when they are refused permission to remain in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the reluctance of community groups to become involved in any policing arrangements for ensuring that persons released into the community would not abscond; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the difficulties associated with providing adequate support arrangements if unauthorised border arrivals were released into the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also listened to various complaints and criticisms about the immigration detention centres and sought responses from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Protective Service (APS) in relation to those complaints. The Committee found that the Department and APS were sensitive to the criticisms and were able to point to a range of improvements which had been made. In March 1992, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) prepared a draft report detailing the findings of visits made to the Darwin Detention Centre and the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre by the Acting Secretary of HREOC in August and December 1991, following representations which had been made to HREOC. This report, considered by the Committee, confirmed that most issues relating to conditions within detention centres are readily addressed and the most serious problem faced by detainees was the length of time they were likely to be held in detention awaiting determination of their refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee considered that the Government cannot be held responsible for prolonged detention where people pursue the administrative and legal options available to them, it was also concerned that there be a capacity to consider release. In this regard provisions are now in place for release on compassionate grounds, including age (both for children where it is in the child's best interests and for the elderly), ill health and previous experience of torture and trauma. The Government's response to the Committee's Report also stated that it will implement the recommendation to give the Minister for Immigration the discretionary power to enable the release of those who claim refugee status where they have been detained for more than six months from receipt of their application without a primary decision. Migration Legislation Bill No. 5 contained an amendment to effect this purpose and was passed by the Parliament on 31 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A detailed response to the Committee's report was tabled in Parliament on 22 September 1994. The evidence in the Committee's Report and the Government's response, which provides agreement to implement the majority of the proposals advanced by the Committee, demonstrates not only that the Government has acted with probity in dealing with unauthorised arrivals, but that it continues to explore means by which such people can be dealt with in a more humane way.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation that an investigation into the allegations of organised international traffic in illegal departures should be conducted with a view to getting international agreement on the means to prohibit or limit such practices.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the thrust of this recommendation. The Dili massacre is, of course, symptomatic of wider concerns in relation to Indonesia's approach to East Timor. The Government regards the Indonesian Government's response to the Dili massacre as credible, including in its setting up of a National Commission of Inquiry and a Military Honour Council which led to the gaoling of a number of military personnel involved in the Dili killings. The response, however, had some shortcomings. In particular, the Government has continued to make clear to the Indonesian Government its concern about the discrepancies which remain in accounting for those reported missing after the Dili Killings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government continues to make frequent representations to the Indonesian Government expressing its concerns in respect of East Timorese detainees. The Government has urged the Indonesian Government to accord all detainees due legal process, and requested that they not be ill-treated and that the ICRC continue to be allowed regular access to all detainees. The Government takes a particular interest in cases where it appears that a person has been detained for exercising his or her right to peaceful protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has raised the situation in East Timor with President Suharto on a number of occasions, most recently, in Bali on 17 September 1995. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, also has been long urging on the Indonesian authorities the desirability of their talking frankly and directly to people of different opinions within East Timor, including the armed resistance, about longer term reconciliation strategies for the province. The Government believes such strategies should include a major reduction in the military presence, greater involvement of the East Timorese in the province's economy, further recognition of the distinctive cultural identity of the East Timorese and some measure of political autonomy. Senator Evans reiterated these points publicly after his meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in early August this year.</PARA>

The Committee hopes that the peace process can be resumed as soon as possible and in particular, that both parties will accept the movement of people within the island so that humanitarian assistance might be freely distributed to all Bougainvilleans. Finally, the Committee urges that the PNG Government and the PNG Defence Forces should continue to give assurances that, in any reconvening of the peace talks, free passage for the leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) be guaranteed and, possibly, that talks should be held on neutral ground.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the generally positive nature of developments toward peace which have occurred since the staging of the Bougainville Peace Conference in October 1994, and the accompanying improvements in the human rights situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the `Charter of Mirigini for a New Bougainville', signed in November 1994, a broadly representative Bougainville Transitional Government was sworn into office in April 1995, and immediately commenced discussions with the PNG Government on the political, economic and administrative future of Bougainville. On 18 May the PNG Government and Bougainville Transitional Government announced a series of agreements under the `Waigani Communique', the most significant of which was the announcement of an amnesty for all crimes committed either "on Bougainville or in relation to the Bougainville crisis" during the period I October 1988 to 19 May 1995. The amnesty will apply to the security forces as well as the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) and resistance (civilian militias opposed to the BRA). The Waigani Communique also mandates the Transitional Government to develop its preferred model for the political, economic and administrative/restoration framework of the province for national government consideration. The Australian Government recently announced a further $10 million in humanitarian assistance to Bougainville to help facilitate the restoration process (bringing total allocated assistance to $23 million).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Peace Conference and until recently the incidence of armed activity has been low, barring some notable and persistent attacks by hardline BRA groups. There was an increase in the reported armed activity on the island in August 1995. Such action risks undermining the reconciliation process. The BRA leadership has refused to participate in peace negotiations with the PNG and Transitional governments, refused to accept three seats held for it in the Transitional Government and rejected the amnesty offer. Should the BRA leadership declare its willingness to enter into the dialogue and negotiation process, assurances for safe passage would obviously need to be confirmed by the PNG Government with the BRA leaders concerned.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President the two reports I have tabled involve accommodation projects proposed by the Overseas Property Group. The committee's 27th report for 1995 relates to the construction of accommodation for Australian High Commission staff in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the Kuala Lumpur proposal when referred to the committee was $11.345 million at May 1995 prices</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kuala Lumpur is fast becoming a city where most expatriates can no longer afford to live in free-standing houses as opposed to apartments/town houses. The sustained demand for properties in Kuala Lumpur has made the cost of leasing residential accommodation expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant proportion of the Australian-owned residential estate in Kuala Lumpur is nearing the end of its economic life or has proved unsatisfactory for the post's property requirements. Commercial and residential rent escalation has reached 8% plus per annum and the Overseas Property Group expects that at least for the life of this project, rents will continue to escalate, particularly within the immediate areas surrounding the central business district and in proximity to the High Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic and life cycle costing analysis of options provided to the committee by Overseas Property Group clearly indicated that constructing a mix of apartments and townhouses on owned sites, selling unsuitable owned accommodation and relinquishing undesirable leases, is the most advantageous and economic course of action in Kuala Lumpur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kuala Lumpur proposal referred to the committee involved the construction of a three storey complex of 10 apartments at 9/11 Jalan Taman U Thant and construction of another 10 unit development on a site to be identified. A swimming pool, recreation room and multi-purpose room will be provided as part of each complex. At the public hearing the Overseas Property Group advised that a decision has been made to develop 4 Jalan Taman U Thant and investigations have shown that it is only possible to fit eight townhouses on the site. However, the Overseas Property Group has advised that this will still provide a viable project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee notes an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that it will continue consultations with the Post Property committee during detailed design development. While there was general support for the Kuala Lumpur project from the staff at the High Commission, the Community Public Sector Union and Foreign Service Family Association, there was some concern expressed regarding the extent of the development at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant and also some details of the design of both buildings. As the site at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant was not confirmed until shortly before the public hearing, it is inevitable there is some confusion in relation to the details of the development on that site. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group consult with the staff at the High Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and the Family Service Foreign Association during the detailed design phase to resolve outstanding issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President the committee's 28th report for 1995 relates to the construction in Shanghai, People's Republic of China of a five-storey building of 10 apartments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimate cost of the Shanghai proposal when referred to the committee was $10.529 million at May 1995 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rapid growth of the Chinese economy in recent years has meant that the Shanghai property market has grown at a feverish pace. The financial pressures on the Shanghai economy are unlikely to abate within the next three to five years. Rents are expected to continue to increase at an estimated rate of 10% p.a. Residential accommodation of a suitable standard and size will continue to be scarce and command premium prices in sought after areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rents are currently in the order of $A19,000 per month and have a fixed escalation clause of 10% p.a for the two year leases. There are currently 10 Australia-based staff in Shanghai with staff numbers likely to increase in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of short supply and rapidly rising costs, the Overseas Property Group in late 1993 examined its property strategy in Shanghai including options of ownership. Early evaluations indicated a simple pay back period for a development option in the designated consular district was less than six years. The Canadian Government has indicated an interest in either renting or meeting the capital cost of two of the apartments. The Overseas Property Group advised that negotiations on this matter are continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 10 apartments in Shanghai will be constructed as a single building of five storeys incorporating two apartments per floor. An indoor swimming pool and a combined recreational room will be provided in a separate recreation facility. Basement car parking and storage areas will be provided under an all weather tennis court which is elevated one metre above natural ground level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apartments have been designed in accordance with the design brief, taking account of local building regulations, climatic conditions, the surrounding built environment and the need for privacy, amenity and security for the occupants. Account has also been taken of the recommendations and requirements of the Consulate-General, which has been consulted in the development of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In agreeing to the project proceeding the committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group continue consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, staff of the Consulate-General and the Community and Public Sector Union regarding possible changes to the design of the project which will allow for better utilisation of the site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee accepts that many Australians at overseas posts would prefer not to live in compounds. But there is a basic dilemma if we wish to continue adequate Australian representation in many areas where we cannot afford the ever increasing rental costs. So it's a case of building apartments such as outlined in my reports or drastically reducing Australian-based staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President  I commend the reports to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will agree to the reordering of business. The business is a shambles. I think everyone will understand that. There has been little attempt at management on the part of the government. I thought it just extraordinary yesterday, with the Senate debating the government's social security bills, that, without any notice at all, the government brought along a whole lot of amendments to its own bill and expected them to be voted upon. Bills that have arisen out of the budget in May are now being presented for the first time&mdash;and the government expects the parliament to be fulfilling a function of scrutiny and review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have thought you would doubt that, Senator Schacht. In this session of parliament we have been bending over backwards to facilitate your program. If you were to have shown just a touch of management skill, you would have found yourselves a lot further advanced than you are to date. But ministers basically have been disinterested in the program. They do not turn up; they do not care; there is no effort to use the committee system of the parliament effectively. Then they get frustrated at the end of the session and ask, `Why haven't we got our legislation through?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in relation to these appropriation bills, there is a matter that arises that is the background, in effect, to changes that were made in the House of Representatives. We would like to have the position clarified, and Senator Schacht may well be able to do so. We understood that the government had made the decision to withdraw from its appropriation funding for the litigation that was designed to close down the commission&mdash;that is, the unsuccessful litigation that the government sought to support with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think last night there was a sigh of relief from the Australian taxpayer that the government had finally realised that using the courts for party political purposes should be paid for by the party rather than by the taxpayer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The motion before us is to reorder the business. Senator Hill is now clearly raising issues about the content of the appropriation bill itself. I thought he would quite legitimately raise these and other questions on the appropriation bill in the debate that would take place upon this motion being carried. As the list of speakers is quite extensive and includes five from the coalition, I would have thought there would be plenty of opportunities for those questions to be put. And, of course, the minister responds at the end of the debate on questions raised. So, on the point of order, I think we should put the motion and get on with the debate. It will be then that those issues which have been raised by Senator Hill can be discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My impression is that Senator Hill is attempting to clarify exactly what is coming before the Senate under the reordering of the program. He has not fully developed that argument. But that is my understanding of what he is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister could simply tell me what Senator Gareth Evans said when he said in relation to the attempt to take the quarter of a million dollars out of this bill, `We will take it on again next year when parliament resumes.' Is the government really attempting to split the appropriation bills so that when we come back again we will find there is an appropriation bill No. 5 that deals with this quarter of a million dollars? If it is going to do that, we might as well have the debate on the extra quarter of a million in the course of this debate rather than next year. Or is the government planning an ex gratia payment in an attempt to avoid parliamentary objection to the payment of taxpayers' money in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are about to address these bills, I think some clarification of what the government is planning is warranted because, as I said, there is no doubt that taxpayers are angered at the prospect of having to pay the bill for a party political objection that was instituted by the Prime Minister in an attempt to protect Minister Lawrence in the lead-up to the federal election, matters that have nothing whatsoever to do with her ministerial office as federal Minister for Health but rather to protect her reputation in the lead-up to the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is history that the royal commissioner found that she had lied; it is history that she refused to resign as she should have; it is history that the Prime Minister demonstrated a lack of national leadership in not standing her down. But what is still current is the question of who is going to pick up the tab. Does this government still expect the Australian taxpayer to pay for this party political exercise, this exercise in which you sought to close down the royal commission and, as a matter of interest, in which an order for costs was made against Minister Lawrence and the other parties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about not only another quarter of a million dollars but likely double that. If there is another half a million to come, when is it going to come and why is it not going to be included within this bill? Why did Minister Beazley last night in effect mislead the Australian people by suggesting that no longer were they expected to pick up the ALP's bill? Why can't these matters be clarified before we start this debate? It seems to me a most appropriate time to do it at this time of reordering the program to facilitate your appropriations. Senator Schacht seems to have passed the baton to Senator Faulkner. He presumably has the answers to these questions and we wish to be enlightened in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that they contain the amendment that was sought in the House of Representatives by the coalition, namely, to reduce the appropriation in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) by approximately $250,000, to take account of the expenses for Carmen Lawrence in her challenge to the existence and validity of the royal commission in Western Australia. I have not seen that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Hill, I was very concerned to read the transcript of Senator Evans's doorstop interview today in which he said that the government would continue to pursue that matter; so the taxpayers of Australia would still be required, if the government had its way, to foot the bill for those expenses which were expenses of a purely party political nature. The government knows full well that was the reason for their inclusion in the appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several questions to be asked about that quarter of a million dollars, including whether the remaining funds contain coverage of the payment to Dr Lawrence of the costs awarded against her in her challenge to the Western Australian royal commission. There are a lot of questions to be asked. You are asking us to debate these bills and pass them not only without having had an explanation but also, what is worse, without having seen the bills. They are reasonable reasons why we question that and seek a clear explanation for this change in the procedure and the order of business. </PARA>

Without any explanation, we were asked to start debating the appropriation bills during the period from one o'clock to two o'clock today. I could not get an explanation for that, until after the event. It is a shambles the way the Senate is being run under Senator Faulkner and the government at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly want to raise a further concern about the government's change in program. It is always a concern when the Labor Party changes the order of business as listed. In the past we always left debate on the appropriation bills until answers to questions raised at estimates committee hearings had been received. We do that because a lot of the questions asked at estimate committees are very penetrating questions. When ministers have political difficulties in answering questions they get out of it by saying, `We don't have the officer here. We don't have the information here. We will take it on notice.' That is code for saying, `That is a politically difficult question for us. We cannot answer off the cuff. We want to go away and give the most politically neutral answer we can.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is every expectation that we will not come back after Friday. The Labor Party, in typical fashion, is avoiding answering some of the very penetrating questions and politically damaging questions to this government that were asked in estimates over the last couple of weeks. We will now be in a position where those questions, which exposed this government's weaknesses, will not be answered by the government. They will not be answered by the deadlines set by some of the committees, and parliament will not be in a position to demand answers because parliament will not sit again. It means that yet again the Labor Party will have weaseled out of providing the information that the public needs to fully assess the Labor Party's mismanagement of this country and its economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have that concern that these arrangements are being put at risk and that will mean that the parliament will not get the answers it deserves from the executive government. If the parliament sits again next year, which the government is pretending might happen, one wonders why this legislation could not be dealt with then. It would give the parliament some opportunity of ensuring answers were given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concern mentioned by my colleague about what Mr Beazley and Senator Evans meant when they talked about revisiting Carmen Lawrence's fees. Everybody knows that Dr Lawrence has been a big embarrassment and has caused a great deal of concern to the government because of the extent of her fees that she was trying to get the taxpayers to pay to her, not for the inquiry but to try to shut the inquiry down so that the truth could not be found. Dr Lawrence chose that course of action, expecting the taxpayers would pay for it, in typical Labor Party fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the stance taken by the Liberal and National parties, that did not happen. The government backed off. It is this vacillating on whether it would go ahead that has sent some alarm bells ringing. Perhaps the Labor Party is again up to its old tricks of saying one thing to take the heat off and then after the event doing the exact opposite. The taxpayers of Australia, whom we want to protect, do not want that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I just want to make a comment about the management of the program. Senator Faulkner, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, would have to be the worst manager of any type&mdash;whether of government business or of the Labor Party headquarters at Sussex Street or of anything else&mdash;that I think we have seen for a long time in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has been continuously out of order. In the last period since Senator Faulkner has been in charge, there has not been any order or rhyme or reason about it whatsoever. Senator Faulkner manages this government business in this chamber in the same way as he manages his portfolio: everything is done on the run. It is done without sufficient thought; it is done without sufficient planning; it has no management principles in it whatsoever. I give the Labor Party a piece of advice: when you get where you will be after the next election, please get a new manager of opposition business in the Senate, which is what the Labor Party will need to manage whatever business they might have when they are in opposition. The way the country has been run is the way this chamber has been run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Faulkner and the frontbench of the Labor Party are continually distracted&mdash;distracted by infighting within their own party, infighting over people like Mr Graeme Campbell: `Will we sack him; won't we? How much support has Mr Campbell got? What do the members want to happen? What does Mr Snow want to happen? What does Mr Fitzgibbon want to happen?' There are threats of large-scale votes against the decisions of an arrogant Prime Minister, even within the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 12 months at least, the Labor Party has been distracted on this infighting. You have problems with the Carmen Lawrence legal fees on whether or not they should be paid. I know, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that a great number of decent Labor Party parliamentarians did not want a bar of paying taxpayers' money for those fees for Mrs Lawrence. It has taken an enormous number of caucus meetings, cabinet meetings, little huddles in the corner and little factions forming amongst the factions of the Labor Party as they try to desperately manage the problems within their own party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, Keating accuses state Labor people of setting out to get Mrs Lawrence over what has happened in Western Australia. This is not Liberal people; this is just state Labor Party people themselves, whom I think Mr Keating called the `friends of Burke'. You have all this internal Labor Party fighting time and time again. It is a continuous thing. It takes up an enormous amount of time of the caucus, of the cabinet, and on it goes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is why the program is in the sort of mess that it is in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party have not been able to solve their internal differences, have not been able to work out who should have been Deputy Prime Minister, whether it was Mr Beazley or Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;it could not be Senator Evans, of course, because his colleagues in the Senate stabbed him in the back at the time when he was overseas. They called the deputy leadership meeting when Senator Evans was overseas. He did not even get a chance to throw his name into the ring. Everybody knew that Senator Evans's reason for going to the lower house was so that he could be Deputy Prime Minister. When Mr Keating leaves after his defeat at the election, Senator Evans wanted to be the Leader of the Opposition, but he was not given the chance. Senator Schacht, Senator Ray and all of Senator Evans's friends here brought the meeting on while Senator Evans was overseas. It is that bitterness and rivalry that is continuously there that is the cause for the mismanagement of business in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the chamber has been delayed again by the way this motion has gone. Senator Faulkner says that he is interested in getting the program going and then he comes in here and makes the most specious speech, which not even he understood&mdash;certainly he did not believe it. In all of the bluff and bluster and theatrics he went on with, he was laughing all the time. There was no seriousness in it whatsoever, and it was just meant to waste a few more hours. And he talks about managing the business properly. So they are the concerns that I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to keep the Carmen Lawrence fees under scrutiny to make sure that the Labor Party does not weasel out on the commitment it has given. As well, we will use every opportunity at our disposal to ensure that the questions which remain unanswered following the estimates committee process are answered before the election comes on, so that the people of Australia can make informed decisions on just how bad this government has been for the management of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been sitting here waiting for you to give a responsible answer. You do not have a clue about how you manage your government business in this place, and you show the normal contempt and disregard for the Senate that has become the hallmark of you and your colleagues over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 plus the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1995-96&mdash;the three appropriation bills which are called the additional appropriation bills&mdash;were introduced into the parliament on 26 October. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96 authorises the Minister for Finance to issue $836 million from the consolidated revenue fund in addition to funds appropriated by the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1995-96 for the annual services of government; whereas Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1995-96 authorises the release of additional funds for proposed capital works and services and payments to the states and territories&mdash;most of which were first allocated funds under the Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating these bills, and presumably passing them today or tomorrow, the coalition has&mdash;despite the ramblings of the government members opposite&mdash;in fact worked overtime to try to cooperate with the government in putting some semblance of order into its legislative program. The equivalent bills last year were, in fact, not passed until the end of March 1995 so, in cooperating with the government in this exercise, we are bringing forward the passage of the bills by something like four months compared with the situation last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That poses some difficult problems for us. What it means is that there are still a large number of outstanding answers to questions that were posed by coalition senators during the Senate estimates hearings over the last few weeks. So it is regrettable that the additional appropriations are being passed without answers to those questions having been received.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do urge the government to respond to the cooperative approach that we have adopted on this side to the passage of these bills by providing answers to those questions which are still outstanding. The bills add another, in gross terms, $1.4 billion to the government's expenditure this financial year. In net terms, when it is offset by savings in some other areas, the increase is going to be of the order of $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is almost certain that the so-called budget surplus that the government trumpeted so loudly in May of this year in the budget statement&mdash;and that was a figure of $718 million alleged surplus&mdash;is not going to be fulfilled and indeed what we are going to see is yet another budget deficit which could, depending on the outcome of the assets sales program, be as high as $3 billion or more this financial year. The government is talking about the sale of the remaining 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. That I would have thought is an extremely unlikely call to be achievable this financial year&mdash;in the course of the next six or seven months. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator O'Chee points out, it is just a few short days or weeks ago that the government was saying that nothing would happen until after the election. Indeed in the budget itself of May of last year it was said quite clearly that the remaining 50 per cent would be sold in two tranches&mdash;one this year and the second tranche in 1997-98. So here again&mdash;and we are talking about huge sums of money involving the Commonwealth and Australian taxpayers and the sale of some major assets&mdash;we have every indication of a government in continuing disarray in terms of attempting to manage its program, be it assets sales, be it the handling of legislation here in the Senate, be it virtually anything that the government tackles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of its tiredness, because of its divisiveness, because of its sheer incompetence, it is unable to give a clear sense of direction to the Australian public and the investing community on any grounds at all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> There is additional spending by the government of a net $1 billion contained in these bills. There is a likely shortfall in assets sales proceeds and there is talk that the government has been putting around in the last few days about proposing to sell the whole of the remaining 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank between now and 30 June next year. That is contrary to everything the government has been saying before, and therefore makes you doubt that in the extreme. So you have to discount that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the shortfall in the Qantas sale and the government's inability to sell ANL. There has been a complete reversal in terms of its approach to the sale of the AIDC. Only seven months ago it was going to sell the remaining 80 per cent of the shares in the AIDC that are publicly owned. Now it is going to turn around and buy back the 20 per cent that was out in private hands. That is a turnaround in the budget figures of something like $180 million to $200 million. When you look at all of those things you see that the so-called surplus, which we always knew was a spurious surplus, of something like $700 million, published in the May budget, is going to turn out to be a very significant deficit, which could be as high as $3 billion or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is going to put inevitably increased pressure on interest rates. That is one of the reasons, no doubt, why the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, said yesterday that there was unlikely to be scope for any interest rate reduction in the foreseeable future. That is why the further national dissavings by the Commonwealth government is making it harder and harder for the private sector for investment purposes. At a time when the government bleats about the need for increased national savings, it is putting its hand in the cookie jar of national savings and drawing on those national savings because it is unable to manage its own economic performance and its own finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have another budget out-turn this year which is going to be absolutely contrary to the needs of the Australian community, and that is seen very widely. It has been commented on just in the last few days by such leading figures as the chief executive of the ANZ bank, Don Mercer, and by many others, including most of the leading business organisations and associations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic consequences of these additional appropriation bills, coming on top of the other economic policy failures of the government, are simply going to compound the problems that have befallen and beset this nation as a result of the government's failure, as I say, to manage its own finances and its failure to take the tough decisions, particularly in the area of industrial relations, that are necessary if we are going to move the Australian economy off of the plateau that it is now on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy has been on this plateau for many years under this government, whereby you get a burst of growth and, because of the failure of the government to undertake the necessary structural changes in the Australian economy, we have to put on the brakes again to prevent inflation going through the roof, to prevent the balance of payments blowing out to even greater proportions than the crisis proportions we already have and whereby policies, as I say, run down rather than increase the level of national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a lot of debate in this place in the last few days, and we are going to have a lot more debate in the period ahead, about just what this government has done to taxation since the last election. Prior to the last election, the Prime Minister, in that infamous statement during his interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program with Kerry O'Brien, promised that the government would not increase the level of taxation in this country. He said that the level of taxation as a proportion of GDP&mdash;he subsequently interpreted it this way&mdash;would not be increased. That was gilding the lily compared with what he actually said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if you accept that subsequent reinterpretation and rewriting of what the Prime Minister actually said, he has still failed lamentably in this respect because at the time that he made that statement the level of taxes to GDP in Australia&mdash;that is, in 1992-93&mdash;was 22.2 per cent. This financial year, on the government's own figures, the level of taxation as a proportion of GDP will be 24.2 per cent. That is two percentage points of GDP higher than the government promised it would be. That is $10 billion higher. In other words, simply because of that percentage increase, let alone all the other tax rip-offs that have occurred, the government has taken an additional $10 billion out of taxpayers' pockets over and above what it had promised to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, the figures will deteriorate, on the government's own forward estimates, and will get worse over the next few years. That 22.4 per cent in 1995-96 will go out to 24.6 per cent in 1996-97 and it will stay around about that level until the end of the century. In other words, what the government is saying to us in those forward estimates&mdash;that is on existing programs, let alone anything else they might seek to do&mdash;that the tax burden will go up in this country. We have always known that that would happen because one of the fundamental differences between Labor governments and governments of Liberal-National Party persuasion is that Labor governments in comparison are big spenders and therefore have to be big taxers. So long as you have a Labor government in power you will have higher government spending than would otherwise be the case. Therefore, you must have higher taxation and all the other consequences that flow from that. You will have higher interest rates, lower levels of employment growth and higher levels of unemployment. The performance of the Australian economy over the last period of this Labor government has shown that par excellence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Labor talks about big increases in employment in the last few years. That is an absolute nonsense. It is true that employment has grown in the last few years from the depths that it reached during the recession, but the fact is that there are no more people employed full time in Australia today than there were five years ago, despite the fact that the available work force over that period has increased by something like one million people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment record of this government has been absolutely appalling. The unemployment record as a consequence has been equally appalling. We now have the terrifying situation where, in a period of what the government claims is good solid economic growth, we are seeing unemployment rise. We have had three successive monthly rises in unemployment. The rate is now 8.7 per cent. It is absolutely inevitable that under a continuation of the government's present policies that figure will, tragically, grow heavily in the new year. That applies to the long-term unemployed and the short-term unemployed&mdash;the whole lot of the unemployment pool. Long-term unemployment today is virtually unchanged on what it was a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other aspects of the appropriation bills that I want to comment on specifically. Before this debate started we had that procedural debate on why we are debating the bills at this time. Both Senator Hill and me raised the concern about the alarm bells that seem to have been ringing as a result of Senator Evans's statement today during his doorstop interview. He commented on the payments by taxpayers of Carmen Lawrence's expenses in association with the Western Australian royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night in the House of Representatives the government bowed to the coalition's amendment to delete approximately $250,000 from the $800,000 that was contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) for the purposes of meeting her expenses. I am pleased to say that we have managed to force the government to reduce that $800,000 by $250,000, being the amount of taxpayers' money that was proposed to be spent on reimbursing Carmen Lawrence for her costs in mounting the challenges to the very validity of the royal commission. That was a party political stunt if ever there was one by the Labor Party. They were never prepared to accept the existence of the royal commission and its validity and they went hell-bent for purely political purposes to prevent the royal commission ever taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no way that the coalition was ever going to be prepared to accept the reimbursement to Carmen Lawrence of those parts of her legal costs as a legitimate use of taxpayers' money. As a result, the amendment was made last night to the appropriation bill in the House of Representatives, which has now come into the Senate and which we are now debating&mdash;that is, Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Today in his doorstop Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government still remains firmly committed in principle to ensuring that she is paid out of public funds. We have made that clear, we haven't resiled from it. The trouble is we have a problem in the Senate. . . the time constraints that we are up against, we have decided simply to defer further consideration of the bit that the opposition won't agree with until next year.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will take it on again next year when parliament resumes.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that the government has deleted this amount from the appropriation bills for purely opportunistic reasons associated with the mismanagement of its program. We will fight this government tooth and nail whenever it proposes to again attempt to seek taxpayers' money to fund that aspect of Carmen Lawrence's legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that there are two ministers' legal costs that are being met in these legal bills. One is Carmen Lawrence's. The other is the payment of $544,000 for the legal costs of Mr Alan Griffiths in connection with the notorious sandwich shop affair. There was an inquiry by Mr Michael Codd involving Mr Griffiths in that respect. Although the costs are included in the appropriation bills, they have never been identified as such. It was only simply by asking questions of the Attorney-General's Department that we have confirmed the sum and the purposes following press reports to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting aspect is that Mr Griffiths's legal cost payments are contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), whereas Carmen Lawrence's legal costs are contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). There has been no adequate explanation of the difference in treatment between the two. From my point of view, I cannot see the validity of the distinction between the two, given that it does have implications for the way in which the Senate can handle those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) also contains a payment of $32 million to New South Wales for the redevelopment of the Sydney showground site to facilitate the establishment of the Fox film studio and the development of a new showground at Homebush. Although the coalition is not opposing that measure, it is certainly not at all clear to me what this has to do with the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on the real point at issue here, that is, we have a government whose finances are out of control, which has had to go for major increases in additional expenditure, on top of the original budget appropriations which showed huge increases in their own right. As a result, this has necessitated huge additional tax rip-offs of the Australian people, which will lead to inevitable further hardship for Australians, who have suffered great damage under this government over the last dozen years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like Senator Short, want to deal, if only briefly at this stage, with one of the phoney elements of this budget, that is, the extent to which the surplus has been massively padded and will not be achieved. Senator Short dealt with big ticket items. I point to the way this government has tried to milk its government business enterprises such as Telstra to pay huge dividends which they cannot afford and which are leading to financial problems within the organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A multi-million dollar dividend was required by the government from Telstra. This was a record, by the way, and far higher than the percentage of profit normally paid by government business enterprises. The consequences are that it is paid out of profits that telephone users have to pay. The more profit and more dividend that the government squeezes out of Telstra, the more Telstra has to get from somewhere. And that somewhere is the Australian consumer&mdash;the ordinary Australian user of the phone services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is particularly dreadful about the way the government screwed extra multi-millions of dollars in dividends which should not have been paid out of Telstra was that Telstra knew at the time, and the government knew at the time, that Telstra would have a negative cash flow of half a billion dollars in the current financial year, according to its budget. In fact, we found out when the famous Blount memo was leaked to me a couple of weeks ago that this was going to blow out further, by another $1 billion&mdash;a $1,000 million negative cash flow in addition to the half a billion dollars negative cash flow that was in the budget. In other words, overall, Telstra was going to be $1,500 million short of cash, which might explain why some Telstra employees were complaining they were getting a pretty frosty reception from some hotels when they wanted to book in on business, because Telstra was not too prompt about paying their bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we know about it is not because of any leaked document; it emerges from a speech that Mr Blount gave to senior Telstra employees which was televised around Australia on the very day that I was revealing the leaked document. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I must tell this year our budget is to be negative four hundred and eighty million dollars in cash flow. So this year we are going to have to borrow just to have . . . to make our payments. In other words, our cash coming in is going to not be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is his language, not mine&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">up to enough money to pay our obligations going out by four-eighty in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, $480 million. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, some of the senior management team members here know that of late we've been looking at forward looking estimates of that budget of cash and it is very troublesome because it looks like it's blowing out for an additional one billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One billion, I didn't say one million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That would make us be negative cash flow by one point five billion for the year. Obviously, we're not going to let that happen, so you're going to see a lot of effort to drive that cash back to something four-eighty to five hundred million, negative, which was our budget when we started this year and is our commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>I detail that because I want to underline the fact that the leaked memo from Mr Blount which I tabled in the Senate a couple of weeks ago was totally correct and is reinforced by what he told his senior staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point in relation to this debate is that Telstra and the government knew it would not have the cash, that it would be behind by half a billion dollars in its cash flow. Despite that, the government demanded it pay its highest ever dividend and its highest ever proportion of profits in dividend to the government to help it out of a budget problem. In other words, this government will cheat, dodge and sneak around to, if you like, fudge the figures so that its budget looks better than it really is. Of course, as Senator Short said, its asset sales program is absolutely hopeless, so we cannot expect anything like this phoney budget surplus to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to mention that in passing because there is another matter that I want to deal with at some length&mdash;the industrial relations situation. Next to financial mismanagement, the greatest area of disaster for this government has been its failure to make the reforms that are needed in industrial relations to make Australia competitive, so that we do not keep losing businesses overseas and we do not keep having Australian costs absurdly higher than costs in competitive countries.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">YOUR RESIGNATION AS A.W.U. NATIONAL PRESIDENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your gross incompetence as National President (and Queensland Branch Secretary) has resulted in the disastrous situation at Weipa, W.A., and elsewhere. The AWU has become a laughing stock under your "leadership".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsible course of action for you would be to announce your immediate resignation as National President, and give notice now of your retirement as Queensland Branch Secretary in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible for those of us who didn't know you in the 1970s or 1980s to judge whether or not you were a good union official. It's clear enough now, you are a broken-down joke. Preserve some pride from whatever your past achievements, and end our embarrassment, by resigning now!!!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mess which is "Bill Ludwig's AWU" began with your gutless failure to take effective action in Western Australia and Victoria against your incompetent friends there and here. The industrial fiascos at Mount Isa and now Weipa highlight your inability to represent AWU members. No wonder you prefer to spend time in Washington while members here are out on the grass!!!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Bill. You know that a majority of AWU officials (ex-FIMEE and ex-AWU) aren't prepared to put up with your domineering&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I will censor myself&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">bull&mdash;&mdash;anymore. I am happy to table a motion for the next National Executive:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"That the AWU National Executive express no-confidence in the industrial and administrative ability of its National President, and calls on him to tender his immediate resignation."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Now we know who is to blame, according to the union movement, for the Weipa fiasco, for the Mount Isa fiasco and for all the industrial relations fiascos that the government is saying, `That is the Liberal Party's fault.' It is just unbelievable what the government's defence for the chaotic situation has become. Remember that this is the government which says, `We know all about industrial relations and we will continue to buy our way out of any kind of trouble.' It has not bought its way out of this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this parliament and the people of Australia are entitled to an unequivocal assurance from this government that it will not give in to ACTU demands that incompetently run unions like this one must be the vehicle, according to the ACTU, through which workers' arrangements with CRA and other employers should be forced to be channelled. Quite frankly, if you were a worker in an area that was under the `control' of the AWU, would you want these people&mdash;people described as incompetent, hopeless and embarrassing who made a laughing stock of the union&mdash;looking after your best interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWU, for example, covered the poor workers in Paul Keating's piggery. The workers in Mr Paul Keating's piggery were AWU protected. That is why they got sacked when they complained about having been given under-award wages for two years. They are still before the Industrial Relations Commission trying to get justice something like a year and a half after their disgraceful sacking. While Mr Keating was half-owner of this piggery, they were paid less than award wages. Would you want the AWU to look after you if you were working in that situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the great bulk of people at Weipa want to come to their own arrangements, which are a better deal than what the AWU could get for them anyway. Australians are entitled to ask: why can't workers choose to make their own arrangements unfettered by the incompetent hands of this kind of self-serving union hierarchy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `broken down joke', according to the union itself, that is running this union is obviously not someone who contributes to the wellbeing of his union members. The point is made in the letter by Mr Bob Smith, the Victorian Branch Secretary, that Mr Ludwig's efforts at representing his members at Weipa have been managed&mdash;of course, they describe Brisbane as `far away' when they are in Weipa&mdash;from even further away: in Washington, USA. It is a pretty inadequate attempt at interaction with one union's membership to try to do something from Washington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should acknowledge that Mr Smith may be considered to have a bit of a grudge against Mr Ludwig because Mr Smith is still trying to clean up the Victorian branch of the AWU after its virtual destruction by Mr Ludwig's famous running mate in AWU ballots, Mr Bruce Wilson. I am also told by my friends in the AWU who are his comrades that Bruce Wilson is know as Bruce the Goose or Comrade Goose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, he is now helping police with their inquiries in relation to the use of certain property, including a union car and a couple of flats, which apparently the AWU did not realise it owned. There is also the small matter, which I dealt with earlier in this chamber, of the $150,000 which had been socked away in a slush fund, unbeknown to the union's state and federal officers, and quite a lot of which had to be repaid to the Brisbane office of a national solicitors firm called Phillips Fox, which, I understand, refunded it to a major oil company which had planned, apparently, to resolve its union problems by contributing to some travel funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Smith's views on Mr Ludwig are shared, apparently, by people like the ACTU President, Jennie George, who has been strongly critical of the AWU and its failure to maintain numbers, particularly in Queensland. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> recently noted that Ms George blames the lack of union presence in Weipa and the consequent rise in the power of CRA, with these direct negotiations, on the failure of Bill Ludwig adequately to represent his Queensland members over the proceeding two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that Mr Ludwig has failed to retain his 350 AWU members in Weipa, despite the best efforts of the Industrial Relations Commission and the Queensland commission to ensure that the AWU is the preferred union on that site. Heaven knows why in so many places in Queensland the AWU has been determined to be the preferred union on site, unless it is, of course, that the Premier of Queensland has a lot of political debts to pay to Mr Ludwig. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ludwig senior has said that maybe it is about 28 members who are left in Weipa, instead of 350. But his son Mr Joseph Ludwig, who was hired by his father under the authority of a Queensland AWU branch executive motion&mdash;that motion said they had authority to appoint an Aboriginal trainee, although I do not think he fits that category&mdash;admits that the union has only four members left in Weipa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unkind officials of the AWU and the ACTU say that these four members have retained their membership of the unions only so that they could have the privilege of running against Mr Ludwig senior at the next official ballot, to be held in June 1997. Clearly, senior officials of the AWU and the ACTU are worried that the AWU membership in Queensland has collapsed under the leadership of Mr Ludwig senior and Mr Ludwig junior&mdash;the latter being appointed by Mr Ludwig senior to run the Weipa campaign leading up to and including his Washington sojourn for worker solidarity. I am sure, to be fair to Messrs Ludwig, that these people simply fail to understand the broad international obligations of the modern trade union official. They are much more important than looking after your members, particularly those who work in, say, Weipa or Mr Keating's piggery!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many members Mr Ludwig really has is a serious question. It is somewhere between 71,000 and 80,000. It is 71,000 according to the Queensland Labor Minister for Industrial Relations, but a few weeks later it suddenly grew to 80,000, according to Mr Ludwig. If he has that recruitment record, I suppose he will get re-elected. But the fact is&mdash;and this is a serious point, despite all that jocularity&mdash;that here is a major union part of a major dispute involving what is the right process for industrial relations in Australia and it is, on the admission of its own members, disastrously run. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), and I will speak to them in the reverse order. In one of the appropriation bills before us and under consideration today is the Lawrence legal costs. The stance of the Greens (WA) on this has been clear from the outset: there was no appropriateness in the executive assuring, through a cabinet decision, Dr Lawrence a blank cheque from the taxpayer. In this regard, I hold the cabinet responsible rather than Dr Lawrence, who did not ask for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A valuable lesson that we should take on board is that Dr Lawrence has been left in an invidious position because the cabinet assured her, as I said, a blank cheque. They also seemed to have facilitated that she got the most expensive legal costs in the country, not only for her defence but for a challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that way the cabinet left Dr Lawrence exposed to a most invidious situation. They did it without the parliamentary right to do it. In fact, that whole position, as argued in the chamber in August by the opposition, the Greens and I believe the Australian Democrats, has been vindicated by the fact that it actually appears as an item in the appropriations. It proves the statement that was made in August in this chamber that the government had no right, the executive had no right, to determine the allocation of taxpayers' funds without the approval of parliament. It did so without having that consent. In that respect, it has been solely responsible for the exposure that Dr Lawrence has been given in relation to her defence costs and also the costs of the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens made a statement on 24 August that the government had shown no good reason for Dr Lawrence being provided with legal funding. In fact, the precedent cited by the government did not fit the situation. The guidelines providing ministers with legal aid did not fit. There is a very questionable constitutional basis for what has been requested, even in this appropriation bill before us now, and I believe it is a question that has not been properly determined even by the committee that was set up to look into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the legal argument whereby the government refers to a particular section of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 is highly questionable and its interpretation begs credibility. What it has used to support the legitimacy of the funding is subsection 4(4), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits under this Act do not limit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) benefits afforded by the government to a Minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>In this case, it would be as the Minister for Human Services and Health. It is not to ensure that she is able to keep carrying out her functions as a minister as a matter of her political survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government has one thing right in that it has accused the whole royal commission of being a political exercise. I see that as a perfectly reasonable and arguable statement. But the government has also fallen into an equivalent error of using as a political matter defence costs, a challenge to the commission and federal funding thereof for a federal minister in relation to her previous role. That would therefore be appropriately addressed by her political party rather than by the parliament and by the taxpayer. As I said, we did not believe that it was a legitimate use of funding. At that time there was support from the opposition and also the Democrats in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel personally quite offended that the Greens' standing on that principle of the illegitimacy of the government's application for taxpayers' money to be used was used to suggest that somehow I, as a woman and a fellow member of parliament from Western Australia, was quite heartless in regard to Dr Lawrence and I felt she should pay even if she went bankrupt. That was a particular spin that the media chose to take on the remarks we made&mdash;which were that she had been left in an invidious position, a position many people in this country are in, but, because of her role as a minister, she was in a somewhat more fortunate position than other people. First, she had a cabinet that was willing to put themselves out on such a limb as to be highly questionable. Secondly, she is a minister, she has a salary and she has not resigned. Thirdly, this is being used in a preferential way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Democrats have made a response in that regard. They have responded to her difficulties by saying that, basically, the amount that is being requested leaves her in a preferential arrangement. They have suggested that it is more appropriate that she be given the level of legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has had a remarkable change of heart and mellowed quite considerably. I am not entirely sure of the reasons for that. Perhaps they feel that when they are in government they would like to accept the same precedent that has been established. However, they have agreed to the defence costs being covered. All I want to say about that is that I think we should be able to rejoice in a diversity of views in this chamber. It is extraordinary that the opposition has changed its mind because the principles underlying the inappropriateness of this segment of Appropriation Bill (No.4) remain and have not been sufficiently addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, that has been dealt with in the House of Representatives by pre-empting any decision that this chamber may want to bring to it or any delay discussion may bring. So the government has taken advantage of the opposition's mellowing in relation to this. It has taken advantage of it in a pragmatic way rather than a principled way. It has even had the audacity to state that. That is something we should be quite concerned about, because I think this is a case study where a cabinet makes a decision and then, by dint of persuasion, challenge in the media, sympathy, allegations of victimisation, et cetera, actually turns the parliament around to at least fund in part something which it did not have the executive power to order in the first place. So the Greens remain on the record as being against the principle that has been involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been discussing, in this time and in my consideration of these bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 4). It is quite appropriate to move an amendment to that appropriation bill. In fact, the Greens foreshadowed that we would move a motion that the bills be split so that this item could be removed and considered as a bill on its own merits in order not to jeopardise the rest of the measures within the legislation by giving it the consideration that we wish or delaying those other measures. We are not proposing to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious that the whole issue has been pre-empted in the House of Representatives. But it does provide a salutary note as to what happens, if there is a decision made in the House of Representatives that suits our political monoculture, when the two parties vote together and come to some kind of agreement. It actually reduces the capacity of this chamber to make a democratic decision and have a discussion of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite acceptable to move amendments of that kind. I have already said that I am not planning to do that, but I want to put our position on the record. However, it is not ever accepted that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) be challenged in that same way, because Appropriation Bill (No. 3), being a supply bill, falls into the convention that the Senate should use its powers to block supply only in very extreme circumstances, that it has total justification for taking the elected government back to the people because it has done something that is worthy of this happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to discuss in the remainder of my speech the issue of the Senate's powers to block supply. This has been particularly relevant because in recent weeks we have had the nostalgia surrounding the anniversary of the dismissal in 1975. It is also particularly relevant because there are some proposals regarding whether the Senate should relinquish the power to block supply. In fact, the Australian Democrats have promoted that view by saying that their membership, on coming into the Senate, would immediately sign an undertaking that they will never block supply no matter who is in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern about this is to point out that, while this might sound eminently reasonable and as though it is assisting stable government, it is actually undercutting democracy in a way that is quite serious. In fact, it amazes me that the Australian Democrats, with their motto of keeping the Senate strong, are actually tying their hands behind their backs in relation to their own strength of powers within the Senate. Far from their previous motto of `keeping the bastards honest', they are actually changing it in this way by saying, `Keeping the bastards in government, no matter who they are nor what they do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I want to comment on that, I just want to contrast where the Greens (WA) view the position. We view it very differently. We view the capacity to block supply as a capacity of the Senate which should be used only in a very thorough, ethical and rigorous way in extreme circumstances. However, we feel very strongly that we should never surrender that power. We believe&mdash;and I think we have grounds to believe&mdash;that it is the basis of federation. The importance of the Senate is made quite clear in section 67 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth</EMPHASIS> by Quick and Garran. In danger of getting carried away, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is one of the most conspicuous, and unquestionably the most important, of all the federal features of the Constitution, using the word federal in the sense of linking together and uniting a number of co-equal political communities, under a common system of government. The Senate is not merely a branch of a bicameral Parliament; it is not merely a second chamber of revision and review representing the sober second thought of the nation, such as the House of Lords is supposed to be; it is that, but something more than that.</PARA>
<PARA>In our view it is the basis of federation. We have been misrepresented in some cases. We say that it is not using the power to block supply that is important but having it. We have been accused of using that in a deterrent way. Anybody who knows me knows that I have very severe concerns about the use of deterrence as an argument to legitimise anything. Deterrence is not usually anything to do with justice; it is to do with manipulation and coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the reason why it is very important that we retain that power, even if we do not use it, is that it is that power which gives the two chambers their equality. They are like two poles of a ladder, and democracy needs both of them. If we lose one of them, which we would if we lost the power to block supply, which is the equivalent of the Prime Minister's power to dissolve both houses of parliament and call a double dissolution election, we would become a pole rather than a ladder and we would have all the associated discomfort of a pole. Remember: what we are aiming for is to aspire to democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go on to talk about the Greens' view of the importance of retaining that power, regardless of whether we use it or not. While it may be legitimately argued and perfectly understandable for a group like the Democrats to say that they want to voluntarily relinquish that power&mdash;and there could be electoral reasons for it or conviction reasons for it, and I do not deny the right of the Democrats to do that&mdash;it is quite another matter to propose that those powers be stripped from everybody else in the Senate. I want to raise that as a very serious matter of concern&mdash;when people propose a referendum that is going to undermine the basis of federation and this constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trap is that it falls into what has been a very unhidden part of the Keating Labor agenda: abolishing the Senate. If people think I am being paranoid, I refer to comments made over past years&mdash;comments like `unrepresentative swill', the threat to change the voting of the Senate to single member electorates to rid it of its cumbersome minor parties and the genuine disrespect on every announcement that the Senate has actually sought to amend something that is not to the liking of the cabinet and the executive. I do believe there is an agenda to abolish the Senate, and I think we should be very aware of that. We should be very aware of that when any referendum to remove the power to block supply is mooted. I think it would be an unmitigated disaster for Australia and for democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been quite wrong to think of the House of Representatives in some way as having greater legitimacy or greater representativeness than the Senate. In fact, it is quite a myth to call the House of Representatives the `people's house'. Because government is formed by majority support in the House of Representatives and preferential voting means that it is nearly impossible to elect any members to that House who are not members of either the ALP or the coalition, party bloc voting means that members of the House invariably support cabinet and any bill put up will pass unless party members cross the floor. So the House of Representatives becomes a rubber stamp for cabinet. That is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, with proportional representation, has the power to review cabinet outcomes and is often the only point of review. It is the only place where significant minority interests get direct representation. So the Senate is actually the house worthy of the title `people's house'. In fact, what we have is the House of Representatives as the house of majority and the Senate chamber as the house of democracy. To support that I would like to again read from some favourite quotes of mine. One is in Odgers, and there are two others that are quite delightful. The first one is in relation to the houses, and is by John Stuart Mill. The second quote is at the beginning, in relation to the separation of powers. The John Stuart Mill quote relates to the reason he offered for supporting a parliament with two houses. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consideration which tells most, in my judgment, in favour of two Chambers (and this I do regard as of some moment) is the evil effect produced upon the mind of any holder of power, whether an individual or an assembly, by the consciousness of having only themselves to consult. It is important that no set of persons should, in great affairs, be able, even temporarily, to make their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sic volo</EMPHASIS> prevail without asking any one else for his consent. A majority in a single assembly, when it has assumed a permanent character&mdash;when composed of the same persons habitually acting together, and always assured of victory in their own House&mdash;easily becomes despotic and overweening, if released from the necessity of considering whether its acts will be concurred in by another constituted authority.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a delightful quote and I commend it to my colleagues. It is rather long so I will not continue with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the link to the separation of powers is that if the House of Representatives consists of a three-yearly elected dictatorship of the executive, it is at liberty to do what it has gained support in this chamber to do because of the two major parties voting together. That is to overrule and pre-empt decisions of the High Court by bringing in legislation that severely crosses the separation of powers. I now quote Andrew Inglis Clark at the beginning of Odgers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You must have an independent legislature, an independent executive, and an independent judiciary, and you can have only a mutilated government if you deprive it of any one of these branches.</PARA>
<PARA>We have some great aspirations in the Senate. We have some lessons to learn from what we are doing with appropriation bill No. 4 and some lessons to learn from the useful opportunity to consider appropriation bill No. 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with some notes on what we aspire to. The government has always sought to represent Australia as a pure Westminster system of democracy. That has never been true. We are a hybrid, which our founding fathers established by drawing from both the Westminster and American systems. Our system of government, as with the vast majority of real democracies in the world, can be more appropriately described as a consensus model of democracy rather than the majority Westminster model. The consensus model is characterised by the sharing of executive power, separation of executive and legislative power, balanced bicameralism and minority representation&mdash;that is, a multi-party system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is typical of the way Labor tries to waste time because they hurt each time you draw to their attention their double standards in relation to this matter. The Labor Party&mdash;Senator Sherry and others&mdash;did not call for any rallies about the payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs. Where was their righteous indignation? Where were the rallies? The Australian Democrats circulated a petition about the payment of legal costs in Tasmania, but where are they now? The Democrats voted against the motion that Dr Lawrence be sacked by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side have taken the view, on balance, that possibly Dr Lawrence should have some of her costs paid. It is a pretty long bow to draw and I still have some concern about the decision but I understand that it was an appropriate decision in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me remind the Senate what brought all this on: the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence, struggling in the polls, staring defeat in the face, was given an opportunity with the Easton petition to play some very dirty politics. There is no doubt, given all the evidence and the findings of Mr Marks QC, that Dr Lawrence was in the thick of things. So often `smart' `clever' political ploys come back to haunt those who perpetrate them. That is what happened in Dr Lawrence's case; that scenario has visited itself upon her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on this matter, I want to state publicly that I am horrified at the way the Australian Labor Party vilify and belittle decent, honest Australians who go about their work the best way they know how. When Sir John Kerr sacked the Whitlam government, the Labor Party waged a campaign of vilification against him&mdash;against a man who, undoubtedly, made a gut-wrenching decision, given his former Labor Party candidature and connections. Rightly or wrongly, he acted in what he thought were the best interests of the nation he was serving. The fact that the Labor Party were absolutely routed at the next election and again in 1977 is completely dismissed from their minds. Indeed, if there were any legitimacy to Sir John Kerr's actions, it was given by the people of Australia through their votes in 1975 and 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exactly the same sort of attack of vilification has now been brought to bear on Mr Marks QC who, in his retirement, made himself available to serve the nation by engaging in and conducting certain inquiries. Indeed, one of this government's own instrumentalities, Telstra, engaged Mr Marks because it was convinced that Mr Marks could go about his duties in an honourable, objective way. Of course, Mr Marks provided a report; the findings were accepted and implemented. But as soon as Mr Marks had made a finding which was not within the political agenda of the Australian Labor Party, they turned on him and attacked him with a viciousness which I think is to be deplored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence that Mr Marks was biased. There is no evidence that he was incapable and no evidence that he was dishonourable. In fact, exactly the opposite is the case. I think he was impeccably fair. He was sharp, he was capable and he was honourable. He came down with a considered judgment on the evidence of Dr Lawrence's former staff members and former ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is within that context that Dr Lawrence, in absolute desperation, sought to scuttle the royal commission. Of course, we now know that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was warned well in advance, by Mr McGinty from the Western Australian Labor Party, that Dr Lawrence's `views' would not be supported by her state colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the Reverend Wilson, a former minister in Dr Lawrence's government, want to lie on oath to somehow protect Brian Burke, who is now convicted of criminal offences in relation to his stewardship when he was the Premier of Western Australia? It just does not dovetail at all. Why would a minister of religion seek to perjure himself to try to assist a convicted criminal, or to assist the convicted criminal in getting back at Carmen Lawrence? It just does not make sense. Yet the Australian Labor Party, through its leadership, engages in these most despicable activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised to read that the Labor Party was willing to acknowledge and cut out of the bill the sum of $243,000, because that action raises a lot of questions to which, I think, we and the Australian people deserve an answer. The question ultimately is: who will pay the $243,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know that the Western Australian Labor Party have, in the past, paid off the gambling debts of their politicians to avoid problems, such as with their former Attorney-General or spokesman on law and justice&mdash;and I think that amount was $40,000. That was done under the stewardship of Chris Evans, the then secretary of the Labor Party, now a senator in this place. One wonders whether the Labor Party might have some sort of slush fund to assist Dr Lawrence in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it ought be remembered that we are not only dealing with $243,000; there is the very real possibility also that a similar bill will be visited upon Dr Lawrence in relation to her failed challenges to the royal commission&mdash;at first instance, in the Western Australian Supreme Court, then in the Western Australian Court of Appeal and finally in the High Court. That may represent three unsuccessful challenges on which the Western Australian government quite rightly could seek orders for costs and have them visited upon Dr Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Dr Lawrence's bill for those three actions amounted to $243,000, it would stand to reason that in rough terms the Western Australian government's costs would be of a similar nature. So you can double the $243,000 and ask yourself: how will Dr Lawrence be able to afford the payment of $486,000? Will the Labor Party pay for those actions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hard working men and women of Australia, including those who might be listening to this broadcast, who pay their trade union fees on a compulsory basis so that they can keep their jobs, will be horrified to think that the Australian Labor Party would put their hard earned trade union levies to assist and fund somebody like Dr Lawrence. So will all those hard working Labor Party branch members around this country, who have the barbecues, the fund raising ventures and things of that nature, when they find that that money is used to pay for Dr Lawrence's legal costs, rather than the promotion of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the delay in the payment of such a large sum to the legal firm that was employed must surely be accruing interest. One wonders what will happen with the accrual of interest. Perhaps this legal firm has done a deal and said, `Look, we won't bother charging for this,' on the promise that they will undoubtedly get other jobs from this Labor government. Let us not forget what legal firm we are talking about: it is the one that Stephen Loosley, a former senator of this place, went to. That one job he got involving Carmen Lawrence has given that legal firm, in rough terms, about $853,000 in costs. It is not a bad little earner, is it. </PARA>

The simple situation is that the people of Australia have a right to know the answer to some of these questions. This is the government that talks about looking after the little people. It looks after the Dr Lawrences, the big people, but it does not look after the little people. What about the little people who go to university?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor told us at the last election that the GST, or indirect taxation, is a thoroughly regressive tax. But what do we find when we have a look at all of Labor's consumption taxes? Petrol excise import duties and wholesale sales tax now total $30,700 million per annum. What was John Hewson's GST going to bring in? The sum of $23,000 million. The people of Australia, having believed that by voting for Labor they would be saved from indirect taxation, have had reaped out of their pockets an extra $7,700 million in indirect taxes&mdash;without getting all the benefits that John Hewson was promising at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, to try to match those promises, what did the Labor Party say to the Australian worker and the Australian community? `There will be $14 billion in tax cuts.' Remember? It was l-a-w, law. It was to be introduced from 1 January 1996. January 1996 will undoubtedly be the beginning of the election year. But 1 January 1996 will go down in history as the day on which Labor breached one of its fundamental promises to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are talking about all these broken promises, what was one of Dr Lawrence's first comments when she became health minister?

But we do know that the Medicare levy has increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised that they would not sell their half of the Commonwealth Bank. In absolute desperation they are now selling it to try to keep up the flow of money. They promised that unemployment would fall to five per cent by the year 2000. They have as much as abandoned that. They promised no new taxes. They tried the building tax. In my own home state of Tasmania, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, they are trying to introduce a cider tax. The apple industry has been given no warning, no nothing, and, as a result, jobs will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's history in relation to the financial management of this country has been absolutely and utterly appalling. We know the way the Labor Party goes about its campaign techniques because we now have this document of only 14 days ago addressed to all union secretaries from the South Australian United Trades and Labour Council. It says on page 3 that they would run a campaign of fear and loathing. What a great way to run this country. What an honourable way to try to win the votes of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But their tactics have been exposed, undoubtedly by one trade unionist who does have some moral fibre and who is concerned about the way the trade union movement and the Labor Party are going to embark upon the next campaign. Every Australian can now know that, whatever Labor says about the coalition policies, it will be based on their campaign of fear and loathing with no regard for the truth whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if we want to know the sort of campaign that the Australian Labor Party will engage in, we do not have to look any further, although it is some distance away, than the magazine called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research</EMPHASIS>, the market research society for the United Kingdom. There is a heading in the November issue of that bulletin `Labour Frugging', frugging being fundraising under the guise of polling. Remember all the nonsense against the Liberal Party as to what allegedly happened at the Canberra by-election? Mr Tony Blair, freshly back from Australia, having learnt all the campaign tricks from Mr Keating&mdash;and he told us that he had learnt a lot&mdash;went back to the United Kingdom and immediately engaged in this frugging.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is of course akin to what they did in Queensland.

Remember that $140 million was spent on that restructuring, through early retirements, retraining and other matters.

It is far cheaper to send materials through Singapore. Fifteen years ago Singapore was regarded as a third world country. The position is the same in Great Britain.

You can see that the road system in Australia is being run down because the states have been starved and robbed of funding. This means that the expenditure on our roads is decreasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government brought in a very worthwhile program in the black spots program. Mr Robert Brown was the Minister for Land Transport at the time. I criticised this program in the beginning as an election ploy and said that they were spending money in 1993 only on marginal seats. It was a good program at the time. It is a pity that it was not kept going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia the black spots that have not been repaired have been replaced by something of a different colour&mdash;white crosses. As I drive along the Great Eastern Highway at Southern Cross, which is 370 kilometres from Perth and which is where I live, I can see&mdash;and I have been driving both private cars and commercial vehicles over the years&mdash;the bad spots. As I go past these spots I can see month after month the number of white crosses is increasing. The government should&mdash;and we will do it in government&mdash;increase road funding for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For every half a million dollars that was spent on a black spot, a life was saved. Each fatality costs Australia $631,000. It is estimated that the black spot program has saved 540 lives since inception and $340,740,000 in the on-costs that come out of road trauma. During the period of this program the costs were only $270 million, so it just shows you what can be done. Of course, there is the employment angle. For every $1 million spent on roads, 61 person-years of employment were created, together with 25 jobs directly related to roads and 36 jobs in related industries. So it does a lot for employment as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is running out, but I would just like to address, as Senator Abetz did, Carmen Lawrence's legal bills. The amount in the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1995-96 was reduced in the House of Representatives yesterday, I believe, by $243,537 for Dr Lawrence's legal bills for the challenge to the WA royal commission in the Supreme Court and the High Court. Now they seek funds, instead of the original figure, of $556,463 for legal bills. However, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has said that the estimated cost for Dr Lawrence is to be only $456,603. That is about a $100,000 difference. I would just ask the question: why is there a $100,000 gap? Is that because more bills are coming? Is an interest bill coming in or something like that? I would like to know exactly where the rest is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Appropriation Bill (No. 3), this government is proposing to appropriate $550,000 for the legal fees of a former minister&mdash;that is a different minister&mdash;who could not run a sandwich shop. So between those two ministers it adds up to nearly $1 million in legal fees for ministers who either could not run a sandwich shop or seemed to have a great lack of memory, which is a disaster. Even though this minister in the other house who was a former Premier of WA has been found by a royal commission to have not acted correctly, Mr Keating refuses to tell her to go, whereas he should have long before now and cut the bills and cut the costs where they are at this stage and not have to worry about it any more in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an interjection across the way when that royal commission made its finding, one of the government members over there said, `You didn't mention a couple of ministers in the Fraser government that did something wrong.' I think that was up in Queensland, and I am battling to remember who they were, but the point is that they were guilty of a misdemeanour. They admitted it, and Fraser sacked them that day. They were gone. No excuses. Bang, they were gone. I think there might have been another one as well somewhere along the line. That is what Mr Keating should have done at the time and saved Australia $1 million in legal fees in total&mdash;that is, if it is in total and there is not more to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to address the two items in these appropriation bills which deal with the funding for the legal fees for Mr Alan Griffiths MP and the legal fees for Dr Carmen Lawrence. The total amount that I have here for Mr Alan Griffiths MP comes to $468,945. With the amendment brought by the coalition in the other place, I understand the total figure appropriated for Dr Lawrence's fees will be $556,463. So, in total, we have a figure in excess of $1 million worth of legal fees for two people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that at the outset one sees that, in Dr Lawrence's case, fees were paid at the hourly rate of $500 for a Queen's Counsel; $250 for counsel assisting; and a range from $125 to $330 for instructing solicitor. That is per hour, of course. In relation to Mr Griffiths's fees, they were set at the hourly rate of $350 for a principal; $200 for a solicitor; and $100 for a clerk. Although Mr Griffiths's fees related to a period which ran from January 1994, I think, through to February 1995 and Dr Lawrence's fees related to some months earlier this year, I cannot see that the disparity in time could equal the disparity in the hourly rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first issue I would raise is: why can't the Commonwealth settle a set rate by which it will provide assistance to people? It does it with legal aid in the community. That is a set rate. There is no question about that, but it seems that what we have here is that the rate is set on an ad hoc basis. This is entirely unsatisfactory when you are looking at in excess of $1 million worth of legal fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect I would raise in relation to Dr Lawrence's fees is that the government has decided to adopt the decision of the majority of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in relation to payment of a minister's legal costs. In that report which looked at this decision, the committee recommended by a majority that, if the government wished to proceed with the payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs, it should do so by introducing a single-line appropriation into the parliament in order to allow the matter to be decided upon directly by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I am pleased to see that the government has taken the advice of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, because when the government was pressed it was not exactly clear how the cabinet came to this decision. In fact, there was mention of payment being made under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, supported by the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, and also by way of an appropriation bill. The evidence that was put to the Senate was scant indeed as to how cabinet intended to go about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is relevant to the point I am making, which is that this decision was made on the run. It was made with bits and pieces of legal advice, to use Senator Gareth Evans's phrase, and it was done entirely in an ad hoc fashion. When you are dealing with this sort of amount of money, I think you really are letting down the taxpayers of Australia when you make these decisions on the run. What has happened, of course, is that through not thinking this through, the government initially set aside $800,000 but has now left Dr Lawrence in the lurch because only $556,000 has been approved. There was not any clarity of how this money was to be spent and whether it was to be spent challenging the royal commission in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect which I am still waiting for an answer on. I asked Senator Ray last week whether the Attorney-General's Department had contemplated who would pay for the costs awarded against Dr Lawrence in the Supreme Court and the High Court. No answer has yet been forthcoming, although Senator Ray undertook to take that up with the Attorney-General's Department. It would seem that those amounts of costs awarded against Dr Lawrence would be substantial, because her figure for challenging the royal commission was in the sum of $247,000. Of course, if the other party's fees are the same, she could well be facing a bill in that amount in addition to the amount that it has cost her to challenge the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, because of the government's lack of attention to detail and because of its shoddiness in the way it has approached this matter, I believe it has left Dr Lawrence in the lurch; it has left Dr Lawrence's solicitors in the lurch. But, above all, I think it has treated the whole process with contempt. The executive in this case has behaved in an arrogant fashion and with total disregard to the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the coalition was made on balance, as Senator Abetz said, in relation to the payment of these fees. Certainly, if there is a royal commission and someone is involved in the royal commission by way of their official duty in the past, then the government that is calling that royal commission normally pays fees for that person. There is precedent for that. The Western Australian government agreed to pay Dr Lawrence's fees for her appearances before the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But quite rightly the Western Australian government refused to meet her costs to challenge the validity of the royal commission. I might add that her three applications were all defeated&mdash;her application to a single judge in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the Full Court of Western Australia and the High Court. When you look at those decisions, you can see the lack of merit in her applications in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that the government has seen fit to put the Senate in a spot whereby we are faced with a situation which is a fait accompli&mdash;money has been expended over and above the Western Australian allocation for Dr Lawrence's representation. I would say Dr Lawrence has been looked after in a most generous way. Certainly I think the provision of two counsel with an instructing solicitor is as generous as it can get, especially when you consider the disbursements in relation to accommodating those counsel who had to travel from the eastern states. I look at one aspect which was $18,000 alone for photocopying. I think accommodation was in excess of $40,000 and travelling was in excess of $40,000. Nonetheless the coalition has decided that it will not be churlish and it will, on balance, support the payment of those fees which relate to the representation of Dr Lawrence before the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the challenge that was mounted against the royal commission, I would submit there was lack of merit and certainly that went above and beyond any possible call that a minister could make on a government. I believe the problem we have here is that there are not sufficient guidelines in relation to how a minister's costs are met in these particular instances. I might add that the guidelines that the Commonwealth does have in place did not accommodate Dr Lawrence's situation. The guidelines that are in place do not provide for an action to be commenced by the person concerned, as was done by Dr Lawrence in relation to the challenge against the royal commission, but relate to the defending of actions brought against the person involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Mr Griffiths's fees, I see that the fees relate to the initiating of the Codd inquiry, the trial against Lynette Harrison, Mr Griffith's former business associate, and also answers and interviews which related to the preparation of drafts, collation of material and interviews with Mr Griffiths in relation to newspaper and media materials and activities. This was subsequent to an interview by the inquiry on 10 December 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the sums, we see that quite substantial sums are allocated to the three discrete aspects of the funding involved. This funding totalled $468,000 in round figures. I note that in January 1994 Mr Griffiths was conducting his own case against Lynette Harrison, his former business associate. I can say that from the two-page letter that has been provided in relation to break down it does not specifically exclude any work done in that case, although it does not mention it. I just wonder what assurance there is that those fees did not relate to that private action which was brought by Mr Griffiths as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that there are not going to be situations where a minister, acting in the course of his or her duty, might be funded by the government of the day, but there should be strict guidelines laid down as to how any decision in relation to the funding thereto is made. There has to be absolute transparency and decisions have to be made on a carefully considered basis and not on the run or on an ad hoc basis without sufficient legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, all care must be taken that there should be consistency of funding&mdash;that is, the applicable rate be uniform&mdash;and furthermore there should be due inquiry as to where the money was spent and there should be a full itemisation of the accounts in question. I look at the costs in relation to Mr Griffiths and we have here totals which deal with solicitors' costs and partners and principles, but they are in round figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the itemisation of disbursements&mdash;photocopying, $9,600; facsimile, $7.800. I would be interested to know at what rate per page photocopying was done and what cost per facsimile. If you prepared a legal aid bill, you would be asked those questions. If you billed a private client, you would be asked those questions. You would have to itemise each letter, each telephone call and the folios you had drafted in relation to the legal costs concerned. But we do not have that here. I think that is totally unsatisfactory, particularly when you are spending in excess of $1 million of taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would know that the conduct of the Australian Securities Commission has been a matter of some concern to me for a great deal of time. In particular, I have been concerned about the conduct of the Australian Securities Commission in relation to a failed investment scheme called Aust-Home Investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter would be known to Senator Jones because I know Senator Jones has been approached by people in relation to Aust-Home Investments. Senator Jones might be interested to know that I now have to hand information which suggests that the investigator employed by the ASC who ran the investigations into the Aust-Home matters appears to have misled the court and the Attorney-General in relation to an interim report which he claims was done pursuant to the ASC law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is of grave concern because it has had serious implications for investors in the scheme who were caught in court applications that were made by the Australian Securities Commission to freeze their assets. Honourable senators would know that I have raised the case of Margo and Max Bunt before because they were two innocent investors whose assets were frozen on an application of the Australian Securities Commission to which they were forced to consent for the simple reason that Mrs Bunt, in particular, was told that if she did not consent to applications freezing her assets the ASC would go ahead and also freeze her salary at Qantas as well. That is the information that has been provided to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under duress, poor Mr and Mrs Bunt said, `We give in; we will agree to the orders for the time being.' The consequence of their agreeing to those orders in 1992 was some 18 months of litigation to get the orders rescinded and an ongoing fight in relation to their court costs to defend their family home from the Australian Securities Commission, which was supposedly going in there to defend their interests as investors in a failed scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a wonderful situation when the Australian Securities Commission alleges that a scheme is defrauding investors&mdash;I believe the scheme was fraudulent&mdash;and then proceeds to say, `We are going to freeze all of these assets which we believe are caught up in this scheme to protect the innocent investors.' Whose assets do they freeze? They froze the assets of the innocent investors. Those investors suffered massive losses of income and massive legal expenses as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out one thing. Early on in the piece, Mr Brendan Behan&mdash;he was not a playwright, unfortunately; he was one of the ASC investigators&mdash;claimed in court documents that he had conducted an interim investigation into 50 named respondents and companies pursuant to provisions of section 13 of the ASC law. That material is contained in an affidavit that was sworn by Mr Behan and filed with the court on 16 March 1992. It is interesting that Mr Behan claims to have been investigating these companies for three months, the point at which he filed the affidavit. So sloppy was the investigatory work undertaken by Mr Behan that he was not even aware of the relationship between some of the respondent  companies and some of the respondent investors and the fraudulent company, Aust-Home Investments Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself is fairly disturbing, but what is very disturbing was that it appears that the interim report was not filed until some time after the affidavit was sworn. It was not until the following year after the affidavit was filed that the interim report was prepared. The interim report, under section 16 of the ASC law, was prepared and dated 23 January 1993, not March 1992. In fact, the extracts of the minutes of meeting 246 of the Australian Securities Commission, prepared and dated 1 February 1993, state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resolved that the Commission adopt the Interim Report pursuant to Section 16(2) of the ASC Law and that it be forwarded to the Attorney-General pursuant to Section 18(1) of the ASC law, for the purposes of winding up under 461(h) of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA>That in itself gives lie to the claim by Mr Behan that he prepared an interim report in 1992. It was not even considered by the ASC until 1993, by which time the ASC, in its oppressive court actions against the innocent investors, had already ensured the consent of Mr and Mrs Bunt and other innocent investors to having their assets frozen, in part because Mr Behan asserted that he had conducted an interim report when he quite obviously had not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, this report that was supposed to be forwarded to the Attorney-General was not available to the then Attorney-General at the time. My understanding is that that report has only just been received by the Attorney-General. I might be incorrect on that; I hope I am incorrect. If that is the case, I would like something from the Australian Securities Commission to show that they did provide that interim report to the Attorney-General promptly after that meeting on 1 February 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From correspondence which Mrs Bunt has received from the Attorney-General, it sure seems that if the ASC provided the report to the Attorney-General in accordance with the resolution of the meeting of 1 February, he never saw it because it was never referred to in his correspondence with her. In fact, in one of the letters I was shown he said he was still awaiting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going on at the Australian Securities Commission? What is going on with these so-called guardians of the investing public? We now have a situation where it appears that officers of the Australian Securities Commission have wilfully misled the Attorney-General and the Supreme Court of Queensland. That is just thoroughly unacceptable. In fact, the various justices who have heard the applications related to this matter have expressed concern at the accuracy of some of the material that was presented to them. They have expressed concern that the Australian Securities Commission proceeded in the way in which it did. Page 18 of a judgment handed down by Mr Justice Hill on 23 August 1993 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next, it is not insignificant that the initial appointment of a receiver was continued by consent. This does not mean, as was submitted by counsel for the Commission, that Mr and Mrs Bunt accepted the strength of the Commission's case. There are many reasons why parties consent to interlocutory orders being continued, not the least of which is the potential difficulty of raising finance to meet the costs of a court case . . . No doubt it suited the Commission not to continue the litigation to final hearing as it was pursuing its investigations in the Aust-Home Group. It must, I think, be said that the Commission appears not to have understood the underlying nature of the appointment of a receiver under s.1323(3). In particular it is clear, as is emphasised by Cooper J in His Honour's judgment of 19 March 1993, that the interim appointment of a receiver should only remain in force for a limited period. In fact, for whatever reason, the orders remained in force for in excess of 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a decision from the bench. It is quite clear that the actions which have been embarked upon by the Australian Securities Commission have at the very least been misguided. At the very worst, one could characterise these actions as vindictive, oppressive, malicious and spiteful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bunts have sought to sue the Australian Securities Commission for the loss which they have suffered as a result of the actions of the ASC. There is no doubt that they have probably lost hundreds of thousands of dollars as a result of the precipitous action of the ASC. Of course, there is a provision in the legislation which says that the ASC cannot be sued, nor can its officers be sued when they act in good faith. I believe that what I have outlined to the Senate shows that certain officers of the ASC have failed in that solemn duty to act in good faith. They have failed in that solemn duty because they have misled the Attorney-General. No wonder the Attorney-General had so much difficulty dealing with the correspondence from Mrs Bunt because he was believing that what he was told by the Australian Securities Commission was correct. It was incorrect. I pity Mr Duffy and I pity Mr Lavarch, who have quite clearly been mislead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the ASC would mislead the Attorney-General is indicative of the fact that they have probably not acted in good faith in this matter. Even if they did act in good faith in seeking the applications that they originally sought, they certainly did not act in good faith in continuing to maintain that they were entitled to the benefit of those orders, nor did they act in good faith in trying to cover up their own mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Bunts have a very good case against the Australian Securities Commission because the Australian Securities Commission did not act in good faith. There was never an interim report done prior to the initiation of application QG3004 of 1992. The ASC did not conduct a proper investigation. That is quite clear. They did not provide information to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is also clear. They have misled the minister. It is thoroughly unacceptable for the Australian people to be told to put their faith in the ASC because it will be their watchdog when, in fact, the ASC has failed to protect the rights and interests of the innocent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a danger in these matters that in pursuing what the ASC may believe to be a wrong, precipitous action may harm the innocent. That is what has happened. The provisions of the legislation say that if that has happened in good faith, the innocent cannot receive damages from the ASC. I can see good policy reasons for saying that. But when excessive pursuit of an ASC cause leads to a trampling of the rights of the innocent, the ASC then misleads the court and misleads the Attorney-General about the investigations which they have conducted, fails to provide material to the Attorney-General and fails to provide material to the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is difficult to have confidence that the ASC will take care of the interests of innocent investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber would be as concerned as I am about this matter&mdash;that the taxpayer is forking out for the ASC to do basically what it wants, when all these legal actions initiated by the ASC, for example, applications for receivers to be appointed over the assets of 50 named respondents, were paid for with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of this sorry saga, not one investor has received one cent back. Many investors who lost all the money they put into the scheme were compelled to pay additional amounts in respect of tax. Many of the investors were innocent coal miners in Blackwater, for heaven's sake! On top of that, we find the ASC spending additional taxpayers' money to freeze the assets of innocent investors and then fighting any application those investors made to have their assets returned or to have their court costs paid by the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should have watchdogs, but occasionally it is necessary for somebody to watch the watchdogs. That is the role of this parliament. I hope the matters I have outlined here will receive the immediate and urgent attention of the Attorney-General.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that if there are to be changes in the way Australia is governed, if there is to be a new way of organising government, the nature of that debate, in my opinion, is not defined arbitrarily by executive government. It is really not good enough, in my opinion, that either government or opposition put forward a proposal for what will be the issues in any future debate about things such as the constitution, the head of state or the role of government. It is extremely important that the nature of the issues be canvassed first, before they are ever put to the people. We have a unique opportunity now to look at the nature of the debate. </PARA>

Other people feel it is important that we have a full debate about things such as the treaties power within the constitution. The government, and some people within the government, think a major issue to deal with is the role of the Senate. Other people would see that the other side of that coin is the role of executive government and whether election should mean a three-year dictatorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A growing number of people see that there are important issues to be dealt with. We can see what are sometimes very destructive tussles going on in relation to the role of states to regional government, local government and federal government&mdash;the lines of communication, what is actually happening there, how the democratic process is working, where it is not working and where there are moves to remove the democratic process that we have seen between states and local government. Many people see that as an issue which must be eventually dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of debate over the years in relation to environmental powers&mdash;so much so that in order to get the pretence of any kind of agreement between the states and the federal government, the federal government acts as if there is no power within the federal sphere to act on the environment. If local government, state governments and federal government are either unwilling to protect the environment or feel they are unable to, in the end, if the community feels that ecological sustainability is a very important issue, at some stage we have to work out whether or not that becomes a right of citizenship. </PARA>

We probably need to look at the Australian constitution in relation to the role of the international market, because in many ways many of the decision making aspects of the Australian federal government seem to have been donated to a non-elected international body of people who have no connection with each other except their desire to speculate. So there are many changes which we are seeing in a very real way. </PARA>

<PARA>The report on the Australian delegation to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty conference tabled before the Senate reveals an interesting expose of Australia's position on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the NPT. Paragraph 28 on page 12 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indefinite extension of the NPT has been a longstanding and critical Australian security and non-proliferation objective.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement in itself is a sad reflection on the Australian government's lack of ability to think for itself or to have any capability of strategic analysis of this issue. It is merely mouthing the words of the nuclear weapon states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By taking this line, the government is perpetuating the false bargain that is the underlying premise of the NPT. The heart of the false premise is the bargain between the non-nuclear weapon states and the nuclear weapon states. The non-nuclear weapon states have agreed not to develop nuclear weapons, in return for which the nuclear weapon states have agreed to disarm. Unfortunately, the nuclear weapon states have patently failed to hold up their end of the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1970, when the NPT came into force, more than 75,000 new nuclear weapons have been deployed by the nuclear weapon states. In fact, of all the nuclear weapons currently in the superpowers' arsenals, the vast majority were deployed after the NPT was signed. Even now, with the end of the Cold War, the nuclear weapon states continue to maintain their arsenals and pour millions of dollars into weapons development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nuclear tests by China just days after signing the NPT and the resumption of testing by France in the Pacific are testimony of the contempt that the nuclear weapon states hold for the NPT. It is further signified by the fact that the United Kingdom has refused to condemn the French for their testing and by the announcement that the United States might undertake low yield testing in the near future. That just about wraps them all up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, the NPT conference will go down in history as a breathtaking example of diplomatic cheek. Having spent 25 years ignoring their part of the NPT bargain, the nuclear weapon states and Australia then had the gall to ask the extension conference to make the deal permanent, in doing so forever legitimising the division of the world into nuclear haves and have-nots. In return, the rest of the world will have to make do with a weak commitment to disarmament that has always been ignored for a quarter of a century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some enlightened non-nuclear weapon states, which Senator Gareth Evans referred to in the Senate as twilight zone countries, argued that the NPT could have been extended for fixed periods linked to disarmament goals. But while these so-called twilight zone countries were looking for a meaningful solution to nuclear proliferation, the Australian government was locked in the palaeolithic era still believing that `might' is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 29 of this report provides an interesting insight into Australia's position. It reveals that Australia's position on the NPT is related to its participation in nuclear trade; that is, the NPT is supposed to give an assurance that the sale of our uranium will not be used in nuclear weapons. Only last week was this premise shown to be blatantly false. The Australian Safeguards Office in its submission to the Senate inquiry into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty could not give an assurance that Australian uranium sold to France was not being used in their nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a simple fact that, once uranium is mixed with uranium from other sources and then transformed into a gas as part of the enrichment process, there is absolutely no way of identifying atoms as being made in Australia. This fact highlights the weak and carefully metered response that Australia has given to the French nuclear tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, paragraph 31 comments that Australia was concerned about getting the widest possible support for the indefinite extension of the NPT, especially in our own region. This is despite the twilight zone comments made by Senator Evans. Despite special visits by Senator Evans, many non-nuclear weapon states, including Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, were opposed to an indefinite extension of the NPT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the resumption of testing by China and France, we found Australia's position on the NPT to be shallow and naive.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council is a statutory consultative body established to contribute a national perspective on the operation of the rural adjustment schemes as administered by the states. The schemes objectives are, among other things: to achieve the promotion of better financial, technical and management performance by the Australian farm sector; to provide support to farmers who have prospects of sustainable long-term profitability with a view to improving the productivity of their farm units; to provide support in a way that ensures that farmers become financially independent of support within a reasonable period; and to provide support for farmers during periods of adverse and exceptional economic circumstances for which they could not be expected to have planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the exceptional circumstances that I would like to make a few comments tonight. I am not game to say that the drought has broken, but it has certainly eased in the last few months. The drought we faced in New South Wales and Queensland was certainly exceptional. It drove efficient producers to the brink and, in many instances, beyond the point of no return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council for the work that it has done in assisting farm families during the past 12 months. However, that support is not completely unqualified. I believe there are many deficiencies in the way that the eligibility for assistance has been based not necessarily on need but on where a farmer lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an indictment of the government that lines drawn arbitrarily on maps determined whether deserving farm families survived or not. I recall a ridiculous case in the Hunter Valley where one farmer was deemed to be eligible for exceptional circumstances while his equally suffering neighbour missed out. I am sure all honourable senators would be aware of a number of examples where areas of greater need missed out to others that were less deserving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned by the secrecy surrounding RASAC's advice to the government. I believe the information upon which the minister bases his submissions to cabinet must be made public to allow the more intense scrutiny that is essential. We have been told that, in formulating advice, RASAC considers meteorological, agronomic, economic and environmental conditions, water supply and the scale of events. My concern lies in the interpretation of this advice by the government. After all, they are the government. They are there to provide help. Help must be provided by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Collins has claimed a lot about the assistance that the government has provided. It has provided some assistance. But for the coalition's pressure, thousands of farm families both in New South Wales and in Queensland would not have had the assistance that the government has provided, nor would they have been eligible for the drought family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has always argued from a position of strength because he is in government. He has said that we lack the sorts of policies that would provide help and assistance. But you, Senator Collins, are in government. You are in a position to change your mind, and I can tell you, you frequently have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no escaping the fact that the federal government response has been miserly in terms of the historical commitment that the coalition made when it was in government in 1983. There is no getting away from those figures. The future of hundreds of New South Wales farmers was jeopardised&mdash;in fact, their future was destroyed&mdash;by the glib promises the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made and despite the fact that he said nobody would be left behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also said drought is a natural occurrence. He is probably right but, under 12 years of Labor, the ability of farmers to prepare for drought has been virtually destroyed. Farmers were not in a position to meet the problems of the last four years of drought. The reasons for that are obvious: the government has run a high interest economy, a high inflation economy and a high indirect tax economy and has taken away what was the prudent farmer's friend&mdash;the ability to plan for drought by the use of income equalisation deposits. Much of the anguish caused by the government's hotchpotch response to drought could have been avoided if it had not gutted the sector so, and had had a decent national drought policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I want to make just one or two points. One is this: in terms of a group of people who would like to see themselves as the next government, if Senator Sandy Macdonald thinks that providing drought assistance to farmers at the rate of $2 million per week, which is what we are doing right now, as I speak, and have been for some time and will continue to do for a full six months guaranteed by statute after the drought declarations have been revoked, is miserly, it is an interesting little glimpse at what kind of fiscal management will be run by the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Macdonald seriously suggests that that level of assistance is a miserly contribution, it is not. I know that from direct feedback I have had from the farmers of Australia. As late as last night I got a phone call in my office&mdash;because I was the only person there at the time, I took the call&mdash;from a person ringing to say `thanks', which I appreciated, to be honest, because you do not get too much of that in this business. What the government has provided has been significant assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the opposition taking any credit at all for the drought policy, I, as the person who actually put the submission together, know that is a nonsense. But I do want to say this to Senator Macdonald&mdash;I am usually fairly forthright in what I say: I do have to give credit, and I have done it before, to the people who really did have an influence on that policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation certainly had. We only have to look at the written submissions they made to the government to see how much of that was reflected in the document that was finally produced. The Australian Grain Growers Association, particularly its President, Ian McFarlane, had a great deal to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I have said before, the people who particularly contributed to it were primary producers, in particular&mdash;I have also said this before&mdash;rural women. That is why we provided cash instead of fodder subsidies. Even though Senator Macdonald might disagree with a great many things that I say, and I am sure he does, I think he would accept my statement that I did seriously consider all of the options that were available. I rejected fodder subsidies for a number of reasons, one of which is that they do not do a damn thing for people who do not get their income from stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, apart from that, what I was told by rural woman after rural woman when I visited the bush was that the most desperate assistance they needed was not subsidies for something that they had to actually pay money out on in the first instance but cash. I can tell the Senate that I received those representations in that first drought trip I made to Queensland in the most, I have to say, desperate circumstances, in which farm families had not had a positive income&mdash;that is, money of their own&mdash;through no fault of their own, for something like four years. You have to experience it before you can appreciate the utter soul-destroying impact that simply not having an income has on normally independent people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things that farmers are short of during droughts. One is rain; the other is money. That is why at the end of the day we determined that a system of direct cash payments&mdash;which farmers could spend on fodder if they wished or anything else they wanted&mdash;was the appropriate way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the first to concede that these things need to be continually improved. That is why I initiated the review into the drought policy&mdash;it is going on right now&mdash;through ARMCANZ to continually refine it. The last refinement, allowing for the altitude effects of effective rain, was, I have to tell you again&mdash;and I think Senator Macdonald knows this&mdash;as a direct result of representations that were made to me by delegations of farmers from that region that I thought were fair. That is why they were granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I conclude this little contribution by saying from the heart&mdash;and I say this with a great deal of feeling&mdash;I thank God for the rain, and may it continue. </PARA>

<PARA>The 1995 annual report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access and equity</EMPHASIS> of the Keating government really shows that the Labor government's actions on access and equity are falling well short of its rhetoric. Access and equity is said by the government to be&mdash;and I agree with this&mdash;a fundamental element of multicultural policy in Australia. It is supposed to ensure that all Australians have access to all publicly provided services without discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 annual report levelled many damning criticisms in relation to access and equity performance. Most of these criticisms emanated from the community and were directed particularly at service delivery departments. The criticisms were levelled primarily at, as I say, government agencies, including particular departments involved in service delivery. This year's report, the 1995 report, which we are now considering, asserts that these criticisms have been addressed by various government programs. There are statements as to what has been done to address the previous year's criticisms, but scant quantitative evidence is provided on the effectiveness of any of these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, it seems to me that the Labor government is running out of steam on access and equity. I am not certain that it has ever really had it as a high priority so far as performance is concerned. It has talked a great deal about access and equity but, when we look at many of its own actions, it seems that access and equity is often being observed more in the breach than in the actuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's current poor performance is highlighted by the general focus of this year's annual report, which general focus is called `Participation'. Participation was defined in the report as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the opportunity for representatives from A&amp;E target groups&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including people from non-English backgrounds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to take part in decision-making and formal advice to government, including through membership of government advisory and review bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite remarkable that the report focuses on non-English background participation at this level yet it remains totally silent on the level of non-English speaking background participation in the Public Service as distinct from, as I say, the government advisory and review bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The silence on this matter is only to be expected because, when you look at it, the performance so far as the Public Service is concerned is appalling. As a recent ACTU study found, there has been an actual fall in the number of NESB personnel in no less than 28 government departments and agencies. The ACTU study also found that less than two per cent of all officers in the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service are overseas born NESB Australians. Worse: only nine per cent of new appointments to the Australian Public Service were from a non-English speaking background and NESB people were more likely to be made redundant in the restructuring of federal departments. So that is quite an appalling indictment of the government's real approach to access and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regrettable decline in participation of overseas born Australians in the Public Service sector is occurring at a time when we are observing the remarkable success of such people in a range of other areas outside the control of the federal government. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> reported recently that some 30 per cent of the 200 richest Australians were born overseas. NESB Australians are over-represented amongst owners and operators of small business and the children of migrants are achieving better results in higher education than children of Australian born parents. It is remarkable and unfortunate that the Office of Multicultural Affairs has found this glaring inconsistency between the public and private sector performance of such little importance that it did not warrant any significant analysis. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is an intriguing report, if a short one. The Corporations and Securities Panel is made up of some of the top business and legal brains in Australia, it costs $135,867 a year to run and in the latest year not one reference was made to this body. This body is there to help the Australian Securities Commission, particularly in areas of significant matters. Its purpose, according to the Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would presumably wonder, as one looks at the pages of court actions involving some entrepreneurs, whether in fact there was not some significant need for this organisation to be very active indeed; but it depends on references from the Australian Securities Commission, and the commission has made none. In fact, since this panel was created in 1991 there has been only one reference to it. In order to give the panel something to do, the Securities Commissioner has determined that the panel should conduct a hypothetical case study to give the ASC and itself experience in handling these procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me extraordinary that such a wealth of talent should be obliged to spend its time on a hypothetical when there is clearly so much that a panel of this substance should be doing.

<PARA>The president of the panel is an outstanding businessman; he is Mr John Pascoe, the Chief Executive Officer of George Weston Foods Ltd, a former director of Qantas and a trustee of the Sydney Opera House Trust.

<PARA>He is the newly appointed chairman. I hope he does not get as frustrated as previous chairmen were. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Panel is keen to ensure that its mode of operation is not perceived as having an adversarial and quasi-legal manner but an informal, practical manner with Panel members acting as persons with business and market expertise rather than as inquisitors or judges.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can hope is that Mr Pascoe and his team in fact get something to do; otherwise I wonder why on earth $135,867 a year is being directed to this venture. I will not go through the list of the top quality people who are there; the Senate will be able to read it for itself. It seems to me that if you are going to have a panel like this, for heaven's sake use it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to sculpture tonight, particularly to the work of Lawrence Beck, a well-known sculptor in Sydney whom I have assisted in organising a number of international sculpture seminars over a period of years&mdash;two in the Gosford area, at Wondabyne and Mount Penang, and, more recently, a symposium at Broken Hill. I want to talk about the development of sculpture because, with the approaching Olympics, Sydney needs to take stock of its sculpture assets. Although what I say will apply to other cities and towns, I want to concentrate on Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a certain extent, there is a crisis in sculpture. I am informed that the English erected 37 sculptures of prominent citizens in Sydney up to the time of federation. Since then, the Australian government has erected only two&mdash;one depicting Lloyd Rees and the other, Henry Lawson. The Sydney sculpture map of 1975 listed 35 public sculptures in Sydney, and the city council map of 1990 listed 16. Although somebody might challenge those figures, they indicate a problem. I do not know whether that low level of sculpture reflects some Anglo-Celtic inertia about using sculpture to adorn and enhance our cities. I think Melbourne might be slightly ahead of Sydney. Nevertheless, there is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians were born in or come from countries where sculpture was part of their lives. It is mixed with the culture, the myths and histories of those countries. It is part of the education, part of the folklore of those countries. It seems that, as a reflection of the population, there is a need for us to look at this situation. If we are to achieve a truly multi-cultural society, we must correct this dearth of emphasis on sculpture. With our Anglo tradition, we need to overcome a sculpture deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another parameter is the link between sculpture and architecture, which is another way of making sure that we enhance the quality of our buildings and the environment in which our city buildings are erected. I hope that a discussion can be generated that will cause more money and resources to go into that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to my experience of the very successful seminars in Gosford where we arranged for the provision of a block of Gosford sandstone, which has a particularly good quality for sculpture. At various times we had Asian, Japanese, East and West Europeans and Papua New Guinean sculptors. They all created their own traditions from that block of sandstone, leaving a lasting monument. I have a vivid recollection of two men, both over 70, from the Sepik district of Papua New Guinea. They had only ever worked in wood, yet they left their sculptures in that sandstone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those sculptors lived together for six to eight weeks while they completed their works. I went to their camps and found that, although they did not have a common language, they were able to work together. The symbolism of that is a reminder of what I am talking about: the need to make sure that our society reflects all the different cultures represented by our people at the moment. Those sculptors have left their mark in those areas. Their gift is their creativity. I know that Lawrence Beck has done all of it on the smell of an oil rag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose tonight in raising this issue, particularly as it applies to Sydney, is to point out that with the Olympics and the turn of the century coming up, there is a need for us to consider what sort of cities we want. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a vision that we will have sculptures&mdash;of republicans or whomever else&mdash;reflecting our history, whatever it might be. I believe it is possible to integrate that into the Olympic building program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I want to emphasise that sculpture is fundamentally a large-scale art. Like opera, it needs site and space to be effective. That is exactly what we need when considering a major event like the Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is more than that. For example, Lawrence Beck has suggested to me that we could have a competition by way of international symposia. People could come from all parts of the world to work on a sporting sculpture theme. With the turn of the century coming up, we should also be celebrating our cultural history. Our Aboriginal sculptors could make a contribution to the longer history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those things are possible, not only in time for the Olympics and the turn of the century, but there is also an argument for having yearly competitions. Imagine an international symposium with all the people involved converting their blocks of stone into sculpture along a driveway. Their works could be judged by experts or by ordinary people to find the most popular contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, people will argue; there will be controversy. There is controversy at the moment over two pieces of sculpture in the Sydney area. One in the North Sydney area is a sculpture resembling a phallus, which is causing no end of discussion; and the other in another part of Sydney is a sculpture of a prostitute, which also is causing a lot of discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think that is the very point of art; it is to make people consider their city. In my own case, I served an apprenticeship as an etcher using paintbrush and acids in the photo engraving trade. I subsequently became a union organiser where my duties brought me into daily contact with a range of artists and skilled tradesmen in the graphic arts area. I will always remember an artist saying to me that it is important to look at the world through an artist's eyes&mdash;to see the light, the colour and the form of objects.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those controversial things I have referred to, the point is that you have to have controversy. People do not always see what the artist has attempted to achieve. But we are all enriched if democratic discussion of artistic matters becomes part of our everyday life. It is then that everybody has the opportunity of having a say but, more particularly, we are developing Australia and the concept of what Australia is. Any form of art, particularly sculpture, has the ability to enhance our tradition, our culture and our folklore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, I would hope that attention is given to this issue&mdash;and this is not an election issue, I should point out&mdash;and that sculpture be given a little more help and far more consideration than it has had previously from the Australia Council, the Visual Arts Board and other people. I hope that this plea might be something that people finally will pick up. I think the concepts I have mentioned are things that could be considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Privacy is an increasingly important international issue. Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights specifically requires that individuals must not be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. The European Union direction on privacy requires member states to enact privacy principles. The OECD has issued a detailed set of guidelines on the protection of transborder flows of personal information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Closer to home, only two years ago, New Zealand extended its privacy protection rules to both public and private sectors with the passage of its Privacy Act 1993. More recently, APEC's Seoul declaration adopted in May last year has, as one of its 10 core principles, the obligation to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights, privacy and data security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does not have full privacy protection. It does, of course, have the Privacy Act 1988, and amendments have extended the act's coverage to tax file numbers and credit providers. However, its basic coverage&mdash;apart from those amendments&mdash;is only over federal government agencies. The private sector is beyond our act's reach. The public has no legislative remedy for things like data matching by private corporations, the development and abuse of mailing lists, the use of some smart cards, or intrusive telemarketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are concerned. Recent polls commissioned by the Privacy Commissioner show that almost three-quarters of the Australian public see privacy as an important social issue. Eighty per cent of those polled not only believe that the government should legislate to protect privacy but also believe that the protection should cover both public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many calls to expand Australia's privacy protection. The Australian Privacy Charter Council, chaired by Mr Justice Michael Kirby, adopted a Privacy Charter of basic privacy principles outlining the privacy protection that Australians should expect. The government's own broadband services expert group said that, as we move towards the world of an information superhighway, we should have better privacy protection with rules which cover both the public and the private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papers developed for the government's National Information Services Council made a very strong point that `the new information and communication services will lead to the much more active collection and interchange of personal information'. This strong recommendation is for comprehensive privacy laws which extend the operation of the current Privacy Act to meet the challenges of the new information age. The latest annual report of the Privacy Commissioner, which was just tabled a few moments ago in this place, repeats the growing calls for comprehensive national privacy legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As yet, there has been no response from either the government or the opposition to strengthen what is an inadequate level of privacy protection for Australians. The Australian Democrats strongly believe that the current level of privacy protection is simply not good enough for the Australian public as we move into the information age. Australians have a right to expect there to be controls on all information collected about them. They have a right to expect that the personal information they provide to governments and private enterprises will only be used for reasons clearly stated at the time. Also, they have a right to expect that rules about privacy protection will be monitored and enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposals to amend the Privacy Act 1988 will be the basis for the Privacy Amendment Bill 1996, which the Democrats will table in the next session of parliament. One of the first major changes we are proposing is the extension of privacy protection rules to the private sector. Information privacy principles will apply not only to federal government departments and agencies but also to individuals, corporations and associations in the private sector. The proposals also, however, allow industries to develop their own codes of practice which, when approved and issued by the Privacy Commissioner, can replace the act's information privacy principles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I arise to continue the third of a series of speeches to place on the public record the government's failure to deliver jobs to the long-term unemployed. The Employment, Education and Training References Committee inquiry into long-term unemployment has relied on witnesses from all over Australia. The evidence of those witnesses adds up to an indictment of the so-called Working Nation program. The clear message is that the Keating labour market intervention programs are not working; they are not delivering outcomes to the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far I have used evidence from the long-term unemployment report to set out real people's impressions of Working Nation. The consumer's view of this product is less than flattering. Last night I spoke about the voice of despair, the stark landscape for the long-term unemployed for 1995, and the failure of Working Nation in general. Tonight I want to underline the shortcomings of the centrepiece of Working Nation: the case management system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system. It established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this system, the CES is required to send out two notices to people who are under case management. The first letter notifies the person that they have been registered in the case management system. However, the person may have to wait for months before they actually meet up with their case manager. Sometimes later they receive another notice where they are actually referred to a specific case manager. With this system, the government can immediately inflate the number of people in case management by totalling the number of letters initially sent out&mdash;even though a large number of these people have never met a case manager&mdash;with those who are actually consulting with case managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest constraints this system faces when people finally get to have a case manager is that there are more people in case management than there are adequate managers to handle them. The coalition has long been concerned that the number of clients per case manager is sometimes ridiculously high. There have been reported incidences of case managers servicing up to 200 clients each. Clients cannot expect an adequate level of attention or advice when they are competing with so many other people for their case manager's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate inquiry into long-term unemployment heard repeatedly from witnesses that since the introduction of case management resources are inadequate. The perception was advanced that DEET has set case loads between 125 and 250 people per case manager. These figures were given several times in evidence to the inquiry. This is indicative of the confusion and lack of realism in setting up this case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was highlighted in particular by the Auditor-General's Report No. 3 into CES case management, which revealed very serious weaknesses in the functioning of the CES. The report said this must be `very quickly' remedied `as they reduce its capacity to assist the long term unemployed'. It was evident from this report that many unemployed people have very tenuous links with their case managers and are not receiving effective service at all. The survey results were critical in their assessment of the CES case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was found that 39 per cent did not recognise that they were supposed to have a return to work plan, and yet such a plan is supposed to be a key element of the case management system. Surely if this government is failing to get across information about a key element of the Working Nation program to a large proportion of participants, there is something drastically wrong with the operation of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey also found that 29 per cent of the clients had not been asked for feedback about the usefulness of elements of their return to work plan in finding employment. Also, only 57 per cent of clients in employment or study at the time of the survey indicated they did not receive post-placement support. This support is supposed to aid clients in their transition to employment or study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that people who are receiving case management are the long-term unemployed, this is a group that should receive at least 100 per cent support in transition. Coming back into the work force after a two-year or longer gap, possibly after retraining, would necessarily entail a large amount of readjustment for most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most damning findings in this report was a suggestion that, while most clients were satisfied with the length and type of contact, 30 per cent of the clients who had visited or personally contacted CES officers believed their contact was useful. Presumably, 70 per cent did not think it was useful. For such a large minority to be unhappy with the scheme indicates there are some serious problems with the CES case management system. This negative perception by clients raises questions about the skill level of some of the CES staff operating the program. A witness from our long-term unemployment inquiry said at page 96:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the people in the CES who actually deal with clients are not skilled . . . they do not have the skills to create a rapport with a LTU person and an employer.</PARA>
<PARA>This harks to another issue raised in our inquiry Australia wide which was encapsulated in recommendation No. 1 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that mature age workers (35 and over) who become unemployed be eligible to access labour market programs within three months of becoming unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many mature age workers feel that this early intervention is essential. Mature age and being long-term unemployed are two great barriers we have found in the inquiry to re-entry into the work force. As one witness told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to get to people before they become demotivated and totally debilitated. That is essential. It is no good waiting until someone has been unemployed for two years before you come along and offer some assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly a need to make the whole system a lot more flexible. To quote again from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the system does not sit well with staff faced with a range of clients who often show contempt for the process of dividing the unemployed into groups who are eligible for immediate assistance and those who are not.</PARA>
<PARA>The operation of case management is an example of a sound idea being totally mishandled by this Labor government. The coalition supports proper case management but we are highly critical of the way it has been developed and managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, has the so-called private contract arm of case management also under scrutiny. It has operated now for a year under Joan Kirner's guiding hand. Evidence to the Senate committee suggests that ESRA is creaming off the cases that can be more easily managed to secure an early employment outcome. Our support does not run to endorsing these sorts of rorts or the shambles that I have described in this speech. Case management can be improved by a coalition government. The consumers in the system, the long-term unemployed of Australia, deserve better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday it was raised by Senator Abetz that such luminaries as myself, at the time representing the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association, made a contribution to the Lyons Forum inquiry into families and the economy, and it is on that subject that I want to comment tonight. It has been implied that in my appearing before the inquiry it gained credibility, and I take that compliment. But let me comment on the Lyons Forum report and its findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I separate the two, the report and its findings, because Senator Abetz claims that the document produced by the inquiry, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Empowering Australian Families</EMPHASIS>, set out in summary form a whole host of submissions put to the inquiry. I would suggest that the report does not accurately summarise the submissions made to the inquiry and the findings do not follow from much of what was submitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us start by looking at the SDA's submission. This is a submission that I spoke to in the public hearings. I must say that after contributing to those hearings I was disappointed when, rather than actually receiving a copy of the report, I chased up a copy of it and I reviewed what I felt were fairly limited contents. The SDA made a fairly extensive submission to the inquiry and there are a few points from it to which I would like to refer.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to its submissions on support for families, the SDA submitted that there should be reform of Australia's income, taxation, social welfare and community support systems so as to bring about a fully integrated and coherent social system that gives social justice to all Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing this subject, I should also mention that the submission was presented nearly two years ago, so some things have changed in the time since. The SDA felt that the basis of such a system should involve, firstly, the recognition of the family as a basic fundamental social unit of society on which many people can agree; and, secondly, the creation of a national family policy which provides a comprehensive and integrated set of policies directed to the wellbeing of a family and its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SDA said there is the need for the government to provide financial support for families by, firstly, increasing family payments to at least their 1976 real value and maintaining indexation of such payments; secondly, increasing what was at the time the spouse rebate, cashing it out and restructuring the taxation procedure so that taxation falls equally upon one income and dual income families; and, thirdly, the introduction and payment of the home makers allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to what was at the time the spouse rebate, the SDA said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The spouse rebate is worth $27 per week prior to any changes which occurred in the 1993-94 budget. Current dual income families receive the benefit of two tax free thresholds. An increase in the value of the spouse rebate to $40 per week would remove such a bias in the tax system towards two-income families.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the work done by full-time home makers, the SDA submitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is both socially and economically valuable. Apart from the care of persons young or old, home makers contribute in innumerable worthwhile activities which benefit the whole community. Because of accounting conventions the value of full-time home making does not enter calculation of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, this is two years ago. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research by Dr Duncan Ironmonger of Melbourne University shows that the real value of this work would add 30 per cent to GDP if it had to be paid for. The SDA's view was that it was time the government recognised the value of home makers work with respect to three steps that should be introduced. To have the ABS calculate the value of domestic work, to recognise the value of such work in GDP calculations and to introduce the payment of a home makers allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>I would ask: how do the report and its findings pertain to this submission and some of the other submissions? The SDA submission does not support income splitting, one of the major findings in the report. When I made my verbal submission I was asked, on the subject of income splitting, what the association's view would be. I raised the association's concerns with the regressive nature of income splitting. This, as with much of the content of the SDA's submission, was not summarised in the report; rather, only limited reference was made to comments on the role and value of the family which the SDA made in its submission&mdash;issues on which we can all agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other reference to the SDA submission is as a secondary source regarding Dr Ironmonger's research into the value of unpaid work. Given that the findings in the report highlighted that more work should be done on recognising the value of unpaid work, I was somewhat surprised that the inquiry did not go back to the original source of such data. The SDA got more attention paid to its views in an article on the Lyons Forum in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the report do? Rather than focusing on supporting and nurturing stable and secure families, in typical opposition style, it hurls blame and insult. It attacks individualism. It attacks what it terms political correctness. It attacks feminism. Ironically, the thread throughout the report is an ideology based on individual choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On at least this issue I agree with Bob Santamaria. Let me quote his comments on the Lyons Forum report. This was in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Santamaria pointed out the contradictions between economic rationalism, with its stress on the individual maximising his interests and pro-family rhetoric. `I resent it when people talk about giving the family priority and then pursue economic policies that cut the family's throat'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will put it in context, as Senator Abetz requested. I will look at the macro-economic changes that the inquiry thinks are required. It refers to a tax system which recognises family commitments; for example, income splitting or family unit taxation. Secondly, it refers to tax rebates for necessary family expenditure such as child care and mortgages. This government introduced a child-care cash rebate. That is one area that has been acted upon. In relation to mortgages, it is interesting that the opposition feels that mortgages are a necessary family expenditure. What about all the families that do not have mortgages because they are in the rental market?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation was: a tightening of the social welfare system to remove disincentive to family life and a recognition of home makers' contributions to the family. Rather than tightening the social welfare system, this government has improved the social welfare system, to recognise home makers' contributions to the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation, which I have already mentioned, was the recognition of the economic value of unpaid work done in the home in the GDP figures. Let us look at what the government has done in that area. This government has made a clear commitment to include the value of unpaid work in the national accounts through the development of satellite accounts. Australia is one of only seven nations world wide to undertake a valuation of unpaid work. Further estimates will be produced following the 1997 time-use survey which the government put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises the valuable contribution of parents, mostly women, who choose to remain at home to undertake unpaid caring responsibilities. Spouses of low income workers at home caring for children can receive up to $136 per week under the new parenting allowance. The basic component of the parenting allowance, which was previously the home child care allowance, is available to all spouses at home, with children, and was introduced by this government and increased by this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Whilst I can understand Senator Jacinta Collins's concern that her submission was referred to only twice in the report, it should be understood that the report is a 36-page document that had to summarise 60 submissions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lyons Forum was established by people who believed that, by helping to strengthen family life by building strong, functional families, we will strengthen our nation from the foundation up. That is the purpose of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has followed the strategy of Minister Crowley by reading through this document and saying that certain matters have been recommended by the Lyons Forum. We need to look at the executive summary. The submissions and presentations raised many concerns. A number of prominent concerns are listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What astounds me is that the Labor Party cannot welcome the Lyons Forum as a genuine attempt to raise with the government the plight of families. Sure, they can disagree on different strategies on how to protect the family. Sure, they can disagree with all of us who are in the Lyons Forum or in the coalition. They could say, `We agree,' or, `we disagree.' It is the manic feminist ideology of Senator Crowley and some of her colleagues that blinds them to the aspirations of the vast majority of women in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the assertions that have been made are simply not correct. The Lyons Forum heard 60 submissions, dealt with them in detail and, as a result, made some recommendations and some suggestions as to how these matters could be addressed. The actual report is concerned about family life. Sure, we can argue about the best tax system and the best social policy system, but why not acknowledge the basic fundamentals&mdash;that here is a group of people genuinely concerned about the family unit and wanting to achieve something for that family unit and for our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 14 days ago we on this side, and indeed the Australian people, had highlighted to us the sort of campaign that Labor was going to embark upon for the 1996 election. We have that courtesy of the South Australian trade union movement, who said that they were going to embark upon a campaign of fear and loathing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as I am sure you would recognise as well, if you have a deliberate policy of embarking upon fear and loathing, then rational argument, honest argument, sincere argument and genuine concern for the Australian people just go straight out the window because all you want to achieve is the fear and loathing of your opponent by the Australian people. So the engaging of your opponent in honest debate to see if you can tease out issues where there might, in fact, be agreement is just thrown out the window and discarded because all the Labor Party want to do is embark upon this campaign of fear and loathing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when we talk about tax and when we talk about industrial relations&mdash;and now we even have it in relation to family policy&mdash;they will pursue a campaign of fear and loathing. That is their tactic, that is their raison d'etre, in this coming election campaign, because they have nothing to offer from the other side but to target the coalition with a campaign of fear and loathing and hope that people will be scared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party did that very effectively in the last election with their campaign against the GST. But, of course, when you analyse the figures, you find that the people of Australia are now paying $7,700 million in indirect taxes under the Keating government more than they would have under Hewson, without all the benefits that the Hewson policy would have provided to them. So I believe that the people of Australia are now a wake-up that a simple campaign of fear and loathing is not going to work again, because they got tricked once. They got tricked and tricked very badly. They were promised less indirect tax and they got even more than this loathsome GST that Mr Keating campaigned against so very heavily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be associated with the Lyons Forum, as are very many other members of the Liberal and National parties. I believe the fact that Ms Jacinta Collins, as she was in those days&mdash;now Senator Collins&mdash;made a contribution to the Lyons Forum inquiry was an indication of the seriousness with which the hearing was treated by her and her trade union. They made a submission. It was factored in. It got recognised. Just because all of their policies and suggestions were not adopted does not detract from the very basis of the inquiry, which was to look after the best interests of the family unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that people on the other side would have welcomed a social policy outlook that encouraged the Australian population to get the focus off the self-centred aspect and on to a more social awareness concept of society through the family. I would have thought Senator Jacinta Collins and the Labor Party would be the first ones to embrace that and say, `As part of our socialist objectives, we have never believed in the me-centred approach to life.' But here we are witnessing Senator Collins criticising the Lyons Forum because we are encouraging people to go away from the me-centred approach to social policy to a more family and society oriented approach to social policy. I do not resile from that. Our society has been too selfish in the past. I recommend the report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish tonight to speak again on matters which I have certainly spoken on before in this chamber. I wish to do this because there are so many issues related to the whole issue of whistleblowers and the Senate inquiry that I was recently a part of. It was clear from the enormous number of submissions that the committee received from the outset of its inquiry that there are many people in Australia who believe that they are not being listened to. The Senate and its committees try to perform that role, but it is not always possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in a speech last night, the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases was unable to examine many of the submissions we received. I did read many of them and met with some people so that I could hear their cases in more detail. One of the first things that struck me when the first whistleblowing committee, the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, began its inquiry&mdash;indeed, I found it quite astonishing&mdash;was the extent and depth of animosity expressed towards the CJC by so many Queensland people who saw themselves as whistleblowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story which these people told had a common theme: strong disillusionment with the treatment that they had received from the CJC. This did not simply relate to the fact that the complaints they brought to the CJC about the actions of various government instrumentalities were not investigated or acted upon, or were not upheld. Their concerns were as much to do with the treatment they received from the CJC&mdash;how they were made to feel as though they were the wrongdoers, or that their concerns were not worth proper examination, or that they were just crazy people who should do everyone a favour and disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the treatment which whistleblowers or aggrieved people usually get from the department they feel has wronged them; it should not be the treatment they receive from the body that is supposed to investigate complaints. I am not suggesting that the CJC should unreservedly agree with the grievances of all people. Some grievances are clearly frivolous. I am talking as much about the process followed as I am about particular complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This impression was strongly reinforced by the extremely antagonistic approach that the CJC took to the Senate committee itself from the very outset of the inquiry. My usual response to this sort of behaviour is to ask myself: what have they got to hide? This was also a common response of many people who made submissions to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One case which the unresolved whistleblower committee was not able to examine and which I will mention tonight is that of Mr James Egan, a dairy farmer from the Beaudesert area south of Brisbane. Mr Egan presented the CJC with evidence of serious misconduct in the dairy industry, stretching through the 1980s up until 1990. The allegations which Mr Egan raised were the same as those raised in this chamber some 10 years ago by former Labor senator John Black and in the lower house on a number of occasions around the same time by the member for Rankin, Mr Beddall, and the former member for Hinkler, Mr Courtice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Queensland Labor Party was happy at the time to point to these dubious activities as evidence of cronyism in the state National Party government, when it gained office itself the new Labor government ignored its own policy commitment to fully investigate these allegations, choosing instead to let sleeping dogs lie. The allegations were also given widespread media coverage back in the 1980s. Indeed, I understand the well-known and widely respected journalist Paul Bongiorno won a Walkley award for his coverage of this scandal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the relevant legislation has now been changed to prevent the continuation of these dubious practices, the legality of the practices and the actions of the people involved in them have never been properly investigated. Some of the people who profited from the allegedly illegal practices still hold important positions in the dairy industry in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CJC's response when Mr Egan presented it with the allegations and supporting evidence was to inform him that the allegations related to things that happened too long ago and it would cost too much of its limited resources to investigate it, with little likelihood of any successful prosecution at the end of it. Dissatisfied with this, Mr Egan went to the Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee, the PCJC, which monitors the activities of the CJC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PCJC informed the CJC that the allegations `are of a serious nature and deserve a full and proper investigation'. It requested the CJC to reconsider the matter and conduct a proper investigation. The CJC refused this request and to reinforce this spent some money on hiring a QC to provide a legal opinion saying that the PCJC could not tell it what to do. So much for its limited resources!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the PCJC that these allegations are serious enough to warrant proper investigation and I call on the CJC to reconsider once again its action on this issue. As the allegations are somewhat lengthy and have been canvassed previously in this chamber, although some time ago, I will not detail them further tonight. Instead at a later time I will seek leave of the Senate to table related documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the subsequent recommendation of the PCJC, flowing from this case, that the relevant legislation in Queensland should be amended to enable the PCJC to direct the CJC to investigate a particular issue. Such a direction could be required to be a unanimous one to prevent partisan political inquiries occurring. The CJC argues that this would compromise its independence from parliament. I cannot see how this would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would certainly be inappropriate for the parliament to direct the CJC not to investigate particular allegations, but I cannot see why it is inappropriate for a parliamentary committee to make a unanimous direction for an allegation to be examined. I see this as a suitable check to enable some sort of reciprocal accountability from the CJC. Whilst the CJC is crucial in ensuring state government bodies are accountable in Queensland, it also needs to be publicly accountable. The PCJC, or its equivalent, is the obvious body to perform this role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government's unreasonable tightening of freedom of information laws has also demonstrated that government's lack of commitment to openness and accountability&mdash;one of the reasons it received such a caning at the recent state election. Indeed, Mr Egan has now spent a number of years unsuccessfully trying to access documents relating to how his original complaint was dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's ascension to power in Queensland in 1989 was predominantly achieved on a wave of public support for reform. The people of Queensland were sickened by the entrenched corruption which was partly exposed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. The voters turned to Labor with the hope that real changes would result that would transform the system that had become so discredited. I was one of a great many Queenslanders who believed that change was essential to ensure that real reform could be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reforms to come out of the Fitzgerald inquiry was the establishment of the Criminal Justice Commission. I strongly supported its establishment as an independent body that would have the ability to deal with misconduct and maladministration. It was seen as somewhere that people could turn to&mdash;a place where their concerns would be given a fair hearing. However, for the CJC to be effective it must have the confidence and support of the vast majority of the public. The concern I have is that this support is now not as strong as it should be. The CJC must acknowledge this and look to itself for at least some of the reasons. It must not become a mirror image of the unresponsive, antagonistic and unaccountable bureaucracies which it is meant to police. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the importance of Australia's traditional cultural heritage and its place on the international stage. In April and May this year, a company of 30 tribal dancers, songpersons, musicians and painters from the Northern Territory travelled to the United States for a three-week tour. Called Dancers of the Dreaming, they performed in California, Arizona and Texas, receiving rave reviews and a letter from Texas governor, George Bush, urging them to `come back soon'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why is this group so well-known abroad and not at home? The blame rests squarely with the federal Labor government. Despite recognition and acclaim from the US to Europe, the company does not fit existing federal funding guidelines and therefore must rely on the generosity of its overseas sponsors. That is an embarrassing situation for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go into detail later on, but first I want to pay tribute to the organisers&mdash;the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation&mdash;who remained committed to the tour despite seemingly impossible odds. The Darwin-based Aboriginal Cultural Foundation was set up in the early 1970s to support Aboriginal cultures under the control of traditional owners and managers. Governed by an all tribal executive committee drawn from across northern Australia and the desert regions, the foundation has strong support at the grassroots level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its aims include promoting and protecting the rights of Aboriginal groups and clans to control their own ceremonies, to help provide instruction, and to organise presentations to the wider community. In fact, the foundation started planning the Dancers of the Dreaming tour five years ago in collaboration with universities in California, Arizona and Texas and the San Antonio Festival. Eight United States representatives flew to Darwin to meet with the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation in 1990. They then travelled to the Tanami Desert and to north-east Arnhem Land to see dancing and singing in a ceremonial context and to discuss the possibility of a tour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in 1995, the foundation assembled three distinct cultural groups for the tour which, together, would convey the richness and scope of indigenous heritage in northern Australia. The 1995 Dancers of Dreaming tour included people from communities along the east coast of Arnhem Land, from Gapuwiyak, also known as Lake Evella, in the north to Ngukurr, also known as the Roper River, in the south; the interior of the territory, through the Warlpiri people from Lajamanu, also known as Hooker Creek, in the Tanami Desert; and Tiwi dancers and singers from Bathurst Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the executive officer of the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation, Lance Bennett, wrote to me recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim was to present audiences with something as near as possible to the experience of being in northern Australia at the exact time that these dances and songs happened to be being performed as an actual ceremonial episode, in the daily life of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide that experience was the aim of the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation, and the clan leaders were very sympathetic to this goal. First, extended discussions of this project took place out in the remote communities, among the clan leaders and the senior dancers and songpersons. The membership of the dance company, and the broad parameters of the program content, were decided out there in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then, the dancers came together in Darwin for a full week prior to the tour and rehearsed intensively. The dance and song content was finalised during this week and the commentary was agreed upon. On the technical side, the lighting plot for the production was also fine tuned.</PARA>
<PARA>The subsequent tour&mdash;which included Tucson and Phoenix in Arizona, San Antonio and Austin in Texas, and Los Angeles&mdash;drew enthusiastic comments, reviews and even a standing ovation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By contrast, I turn to the plight of traditional cultural heritage in this country and the funding battles that beset the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation in Darwin. Take this latest tour, for example. The foundation had to struggle for five years to come up with a paltry $7,000 from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council. ATSIC provided nothing. Eventually the cultural counsellor at the Australian embassy in Washington contributed $10,000. I am sorry to say that that was the extent of the Australian contribution. The remainder of the $US200,000 was raised in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the University of Texas, for example, the College of Fine Arts and the Performing Arts Centre were joined by UT Athletics in an unprecedented joint push to raise funds for our performers. In other words, they raised money for Australians to represent the heritage of Australia because we could not afford to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor government&mdash;in particular, ATSIC and the Australia Council&mdash;must take responsibility for this sorry state of affairs. They effectively turned their back on our heritage and these Australian performers. They effectively made a mockery of their own arts and culture policies, notably Creative Nation. This situation is a stark example of Labor's preoccupation with Melbourne and Sydney at the expense of the rest of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the Dancers of the Dreaming are back in Australia and continuing to receive messages from the United States, the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation is again battling for financial survival. For some reason the Aboriginal Arts Board declines to fund the foundation, since the Australia Council only funds `new art'. In other words, this country's traditional cultural heritage does not fit into their neat funding guidelines and falls by the wayside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, the Australia Council insists that ATSIC should provide funding support for traditional culture. But ATSIC wants to focus on new technology such as broadcasting, not heritage. The tragedy is that no-one in the federal government or, for that matter, ATSIC, gives priority to our traditional cultural heritage. Australia is allowing a cultural resource to slip into obscurity. Well may Texas governor George Bush write to the Dancers of the Dreaming wishing them `continued success in the future and come back soon'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you have good experience in that, and I may well do that myself. But I will put that action off for the moment and give my colleagues a chance to consider it while I get advice about tabling it in the future. The report details the operations of the Rimbanan Hijau Company and other businesses controlled by the Malaysian Tiong family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tiong family companies have come to dominate the timber industry in Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. Their companies are now expanding rapidly throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Rimbanan Hijau means `green lushness' in Bahasa Malay, and its publicity material claims that the name reflects the group's `green' conviction and care for the natural environment and the ecosystem. My colleagues will be well aware of why I am interested in this matter and the activities of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the company's name is a gross misnomer. The report that I was hoping to table tonight analyses the environmental and human rights abuses of a wide and very complex web of companies established and controlled by the same family. Many of these companies are formally linked with Rimbanan Hijau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes the conflict between the indigenous people and logging interests in Sarawak, Malaysia. It further reports on the massive overcutting in the forests of Sarawak. In 1990, for example, when logging was at its peak, some 494,700 hectares of forest were logged out. In many cases, the indigenous people only found out that their lands had been licensed to a timber company when the bulldozers arrived to put in a logging road. The report lists a variety of human rights violations by the Rimbanan Hijau Company in its operations in Sarawak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to detail the operations of Rimbanan Hijau in the forests of Papua New Guinea. In just 10 years, Rimbanan Hijau and its related companies have taken control of 50 per cent of Papua New Guinea's timber industry. The crisis that has beset the logging industry in this country is detailed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is special mention in the report of the use of transfer pricing in the logging industry of Papua New Guinea. Here, the logging companies operate a cooperative arrangement with their overseas buyers. The logging companies officially `sell' the logs for a price which is below market value to an intermediary, who then sells the log on to a final customer at the true price. The difference between the two prices is held in trust in a tax haven&mdash;usually Hong Kong&mdash;and divided between the logging company and its company and its customer. Transfer pricing allows companies to declare a loss in Papua New Guinea yet make massive profits offshore. The report suggests that Rimbanan Hijau is heavily implicated in this type of practice in Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plentiful evidence is provided in the report to show that this company has repeatedly and wilfully broken its permit conditions and national laws in Papua New Guinea. Environmental problems include such activities as river pollution, felling in buffer zones, coral reef destruction, pollution of drinking water, felling of undersized logs and logging of protected species. The list goes on. The report also cites a number of legal misdemeanours, including falsifying legal documents, bribing shareholders and breaking a court injunction, to name but a few. It also notes that some logging operations have destroyed graves and sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the report lists some of the investments of the Tiong family in New Zealand, the Solomon Islands and, last but not least, Australia. I believe that this is a matter in the public interest. It is one of grave environmental concern at not just a local but a global level. I hope that it will be possible for me to put the report on the public record so that it can become a catalyst for a closer scrutiny of the operations that these companies partake in. I hope that it also serves as an example and a trigger to curtail the operations of logging companies which conduct unscrupulous activities and violate the environment in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about two issues that are very important to the community, to the extent that they have expended a lot of energy in collecting signatures on petitions for tabling in the Senate today and tomorrow. The first is on landmines. With the assistance of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, Australian Catholic Relief and the Christian Centre for Social Action, they have collected 14,579 signatures. They request the government to push for a total ban on landmines and implement a domestic ban also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a big issue in the community. It is an issue that cuts across all political parties, although it has not yet broken the party line. The addition of 14,579 signatures brings the total collection in the last three months to 239,275 signatures&mdash;almost a quarter of a million people. There are few petitions that have been delivered to this parliament which have had the level of public support that has been demonstrated by this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are very concerned about this issue on the basis of human rights, defective military strategy and damage to the environment. One thousand people are killed or maimed every month by landmines. It is a human rights issue. People are also concerned at the example that landmines have become of a trend in conventional warfare to target civilians instead of the military. The rules of war have changed and so have the players. Maimed people are seen as a strategy to burden a country with bigger compensation and health payments and a reduced economic output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landmines damage the environment and create a staggering refugee problem for people who cannot retain their self-sufficient agrarian lifestyles. The amount of arable land abandoned due to the destruction imposed by landmines is enormous. In Angola, eight to nine million people cannot be repatriated on their lost agricultural land and many people have starved. In Afghanistan, for example, where 350,000 people have died from landmine blasts, this has created 3.5 million Afghan refugees. At the present rate of clearing, it is estimated it will take a further 4,300 years to clear the remaining mines so that people can resume normal lives. The situation creates a refugee problem that many other countries have to deal with. However, in many cases, they are an active part of the source of the problem in the first place by producing, selling and using landmines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubting how cruel and indiscriminate landmines are. Many of them cost between $US1 and $US3 to make. Mines may be cheap and nasty to manufacture but each mine costs about $1,000 to remove in a dangerous and painstaking process. Many are non-detectable because they are made solely of plastic and disguise themselves as a child's toys, as balls, plates, apples and saucepans. There is no recording or marking of mines and they are scattered widely and indiscriminately. They are also not self-neutralising and may last decades after a war is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World wide, there are 85 million to 100 million landmines in 62 countries. There are 95 manufacturers in 43 countries manufacturing landmines. Countries involved include the United States, the UK, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden and Switzerland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how should the government best respond to community concern to achieve a total ban on landmines at home and abroad? The government's current strategy has failed. They have taken a compromise position in pushing for a partial ban that is expensive, a technological fix, unworkable for developing countries and more difficult to implement than a total ban would be. At the last meeting of the Vienna Review Conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention, countries could not agree by consensus on such an approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government needs to give up on this strategy and strive for the only strategy that is achievable&mdash;that is, a total ban. If the government proceeds with a partial ban it will be toadying to powerful, rich states like the United States which are against the banning of all landmines because of the excuse of `national security'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot ignore the fact that a partial ban on landmines would do nothing to reduce civilian casualties during war and post-conflict, before demining operations begin. A partial ban would merely aid demining operations after conflict. I have already mentioned how many years that takes to make any impact. Demining is also a selective service given out by first world nations to third world victims of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government, to meet community concerns, has recently moved towards the position of a total ban. They now concede that a total ban is an ultimate goal. The government needs to go further, as evidenced by the popular support given to this issue by the community. They need to be committed to working for a total ban in their strategies and tactics for the next review conference in April 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to another set of petitions that will be tabled tomorrow, Thursday. There are 1,491 signatures from the Imagine Australia campaign calling for an end to Australian involvement in the US bases, Pine Gap and Nurrungar. They call on political representatives to serve to the United States in 1995 a formal notice to quit on the peppercorn leases of Nurrungar and Pine Gap. They do not want the leases renewed with the US in any circumstances and want total withdrawal of support and personnel from the bases. Their suggestion is to redirect the $100 million spent on the bases annually into environmental rehabilitation and job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These signatures have been collected by one woman who has worked tirelessly since 1993 to obtain these approximately 1,500 signatures. These petitions are very timely as we near the national notice to quit protest campaign in Canberra from 1 December to 3 December. This protest will be calling for a notice to quit the bases, notice to quit our part of the nuclear cycle and French nuclear testing and notice to quit Australia's military involvement in the proxy wars of East Timor and Bougainville in particular. The community will be arriving in Canberra for the weekend of actions and honourable senators should lend their active support to this gathering in any way they can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I find it offensive that Mr Filing would make those allegations about a party whose endorsement he desperately sought very recently. They contrast rather quaintly with the fact that recently he scrutineered the results of one of his own branches in that electorate, the Joondalup branch in the northern suburbs. He was provided with the results by the returning officer and asked to pass them on to the divisional secretary. But in the process, he had them typed up in his own office and changed the result to one which materially benefited him and benefited his prospects of preselection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not without consequence to observe that, when Mr Filing first sought endorsement for the seat of Moore, he was contested by Mr Ian Viner QC. Mr Ian Viner QC, interestingly, got one vote. He seemed to be the only person who did not know he was not going to win. Mr Viner QC then appealed against Mr Filing on the basis that Mr Filing had corruptly sought to induce one of the delegates to cast a vote in his&mdash;Mr Filing's&mdash;favour on the basis that he would provide him with employment in the event he was successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, while Mr Viner presented a statutory declaration to the appeal committee, he was unsuccessful. My difficulty is that I do not know who I believe&mdash;Mr Filing or Mr Viner&mdash;except to say that, as a result of Mr Viner recently stealing information from a court file and then passing it around to members of parliament, including Mr Eoin Cameron, I do not know who I would trust. But I find it offensive for Mr Filing to be attacking the Liberal Party in the way he has. </PARA>

He was in the Country Party to begin with, then after what occurred there he became a Liberal. That is a factual statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise two matters: firstly, to expand a little on some remarks I made earlier about the Queensland AWU secretary and national AWU president, Mr Bill Ludwig, who, as I mentioned earlier, appointed his son to a job in the union. I have no objection to that but I am told by dissident elements in the union who are very unhappy with Mr Ludwig's leadership that when the union's minute secretary, Lyn Hewlett, pointed out that this appointment had not been approved and was therefore in breach of union rules, Mr Ludwig pointed to the motion empowering his predecessor to hire an Aboriginal trainee and indicated that that was close enough for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that his son was not an Aboriginal person and that this action denied access to the job to someone who was an Aboriginal person and whose wages would be subsidised by the federal government did not seem to worry the AWU. It is sort of harking back to the roots of the old AWU, which was an historic bedrock of the ALP White Australia policy, which found its embodiment in its 1890 racist anti-Chinese and anti-Kanaka history. I suppose it is ironic that at the same time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is protesting about Mr Graeme Campbell and his alleged racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to go into the details of the internal battles going back over many years involving Mr Ludwig, although there are clear examples of what appear to be most unfortunate standover tactics, particularly in relation to some senior women employees. I should just mention one of those because it does raise matters of concern. An employee, Janine Walker, had this to say in a letter, part of which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Tuesday, August 30th, you spoke to me in your office and indicated to me that you wanted me to appoint Deidre Swan as one of my proxies to the Administrative Committee of the A.L.P. I told you at that time that I had appointed only one of the two proxies allowed me under Party Rules and that I was happy to appoint Deidre as my other proxy. You would note that I complied with your direction within a matter of an hour or two. I asked you during that meeting if you had any other directions you wished to indicate to me or if, indeed, you had any problems with me or my work&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>she was a secretary there&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understood you to respond in the negative to those questions and we had a full and frank discussion on a number of matters, including your wish to see Deidre `rehabilitated' within the Union, as you put it. You stated to me that it was your view that I had `taken' Deidre's position on the Administrative Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My response was that I understood that the ticket supported by the Union at the last Conference was one drawn up by the then Branch Secretary of the Union and that my name was placed on the ticket by the Branch Secretary. Rather than `taking' someone's position, I had followed the direction of the Branch Secretary. You indicated that you concurred with that view of events and retracted the accusation that I had `taken' the position to which I was elected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our discussion ended on an amicable note and I assured you of my continued loyalty to the Union and to you, the Branch Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Monday, September 12th, you spoke to me in my office and indicated that Deidre would attend that evening's regular meting of the Administrative Committee. I pointed out to you that I was free and planned to attend myself and would not require a proxy. You put it to me very bluntly that I was not to attend this meeting or any other meetings of the Committee at any time. You repeated the view that the position I hold `belongs' to Deidre.</PARA>
<PARA>She then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both of our conversations on that day were difficult and unpleasant&mdash;your attempts to `stand over' me were crude and I found them personally distressing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bill, I am resigning because I do not believe that I can continue in the employment of the Union and remain subject to the bullying and threats to which I was subjected last Monday. If this is the way in which you propose to deal with your staff as Branch Secretary and to conduct the administration of the Union then I do not wish to continue in your employ.</PARA>
<PARA>There is one further paragraph I should mention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I further believe that your direction to me not to attend meetings of the Administrative Committee is a most unfair one. As an elected member of that Committee, I am not subject, under the Rules of the Party, to any outside direction in relation to my attendance i.e. I am not a `delegate' appointed by a Party Unit such as the Union. The Party Rules provide that a member of the Administrative Committee who fails to attend meetings persistently without a satisfactory explanation is subject to being reported for such non-attendance to the State Council. Your assurance that that Rule `will be all right' gives me no reassurance at all. Compliance with your direction would leave me open to denigration, ridicule and disciplinary measures in the forums of the Party.</PARA>
<PARA>I raise that just to mention the sort of union rule that exists in the AWU, which is a central union in, of all things, the Weipa matter, the Mount Isa disaster or whatever industrial chaos you want to look at at the moment. No wonder workers do not want to be part of that union and have that union allegedly look after their interests. No wonder so many people who were working under CRA preferred to make their own arrangements and their own direct negotiations with the company&mdash;which involved getting them more money than the union would have been able to get for them anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the central piece of what I was concerned about in relation to Mr Ludwig: the people in his union are voting with their feet and, no matter what sorts of props the state Labor government in Queensland or the federal Labor government in Canberra try to put under this decaying element of the union movement, the workers of Australia will not have a bar of this kind of standover tactic and self-interested union leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These old-fashioned union bosses have no role in Australia's future. I speak as one of the very few people on this side of the chamber who have been on the state executive of their union. I do not object to unions. I think unions have an excellent and important role to play, but the people who have been running Australian unions have, in some instances like this one, damaged the status and integrity of the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since my comments about Mr Ludwig earlier today and the alarming drop in his union's membership in Queensland, I have been sent the most realistic guide to the number of members held by the Queensland AWU in the form of the election returns from the electoral office ballot held last August. These official figures show that Mr Ludwig's claims last week of having 80,000 union members appear to be absolute nonsense. Only something like 53,323 names and addresses of voters were actually submitted to the Electoral Commission. Something like 8,280 were apparently sent to a previous address and a further 3,736 had no address at all. I have not shown this to the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht). I will not seek to have it incorporated, but I will seek to have it tabled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are Australian Workers Union election statistics as at 17 August 1995. Unfortunately, it does not have the name of the Commonwealth Electoral Commission on the document. I will not proceed to even seek leave in that event. I note that it shows Mr Ludwig now has only 41,307 genuine members left in Queensland, not the 80,000 he has been speaking about. This might be why so many people within the union are moving against Mr Ludwig, as I outlined earlier, when I revealed the letter from the Victorian secretary who is moving to require him to resign at the next meeting of the national executive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is interesting to note is that Queensland has only 41,307 members as against New South Wales, which has 43,387. Queensland used to be the heart and soul of that union, which now has only 141,173 members spread throughout Australia. I simply want to say this about Mr Ludwig and his union: if there were to be an efficient, well-run AWU that recognised the merit of allowing workers to come to the best possible  deal with their employers which would be in the workers' best interests, that would be fine. But it is not good enough to have a union run by a union boss who prefers to stand over people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The aggregated total forward development cooperation commitments, determined as at 30 September 1995, for each of the financial years 1996/97 to 2000/01 are listed in Attachment I. These are recorded against AusAID's appropriation structure; country programs, global programs and corporate services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that Australia's commitment to food aid is a special case. A liability has been incurred through our commitment to the Food Aid Convention of 300,000 tonnes of wheat or wheat equivalent per annum for the period 1995/96 to 1997/98. There is no specific allocation for food aid as such. Rather, our Food Aid Commitment is met through country appropriations, emergency and refugee appropriations, as well as the World Food Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitments have been recorded in accordance with the accounting definitions specified by the Department of Finance in its guidelines to Commonwealth agencies for the preparation of annual Financial Statements tabled in Parliament. Obligations are recorded as liabilities, commitments and agreements equally proportionately unperformed (AEPUs). These definitions are explained at Attachment II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using these definitions, the levels of forward commitment as at 30 September 1995 are as follows: 1996/97&mdash;$1,055 million; 1997/98&mdash;$908 million; 1998/99&mdash;$678 million; 1999/2000&mdash;$595 million; 2000/01&mdash;$481 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other programs/activities that are not covered by these definitions and therefore not recorded for the purpose of the Financial Statements, but which also place a high degree of obligation on Australia for moral or other reasons. While there are strong expectations that such funding will continue, these activities have not been included as development cooperation commitments for these Questions on Notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These other obligations include core contributions to United Nations development organisations (eg. UNICEF, United Nations Development Program, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The contributions are voluntary and not covered by legislation as in the case of multilateral development banks, nor are they covered by the `assessed' formulae used for other UN bodies. There is, however, a strong expectation internationally and domestically that Australia's contributions to these organisations will continue, reflecting Australia's role as a good international citizen and the principle of burden-sharing with other donors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The category also covers: allocations to meet commitments where the Government has pledged support for specific programs (eg. Prime Ministerial multiyear pledges for development cooperation programs in Vietnam and Cambodia); provision for refugee and emergency relief; funding for Development Import Finance Facility projects where activities have been agreed between Australia and recipient governments; funding for the AusAID/Non-government Organisations Cooperation Program; funding for volunteer programs; and support for regional organisations such as the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. There is also an expectation of maintenance of support for bilateral country programs in key regions such as the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1996/97, the total value of these `strong expectations' is estimated to be $363 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A detailed supplementary paper of some 127 pages, which outlines all forward commitments, disaggregated by country program, global program and corporate services; and further, by activity, value and nature of commitment has been provided to the honourable senator. Each commitment type is reported on separate schedules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Under the Development Import Finance Facility a contractual commitment occurs when the implementing contractor receives a formal offer to undertake the project.

Funding is provided as contracts are signed in any year up to the total annual allocation for the Development Import Finance Facility program. There are expectations of funding from the countries concerned and Australian contractors for these projects and, on that basis, contract negotiations have commenced. It should be noted that not all the identified projects will necessarily proceed to formal offer by AusAID. The latter is contingent upon satisfactory appraisal by AusAID on developmental grounds, including an assessment against OECD criteria for mixed credits and the satisfactory conclusion to negotiations between the Australian supplier and the buyer in the recipient country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there is a firm intention to incur a future liability for goods or services which are yet to be provided. The commitment actually arises when a definite decision is made to incur the liability (eg. when FR 44A approval is given to a spending proposal); or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">action has been taken to determine the actual amount of the commitment or a reliable estimate, and where the conditions to be satisfied under the obligation are clearly defined in a written agreement (eg written record of a High Level Consultation that specifies agreed individual activities including a firm estimate of cost). If the above requirements are not satisfied, then the intention to incur a future liability is considered too vague for there to be a commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule B records commitments covered by Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which are firm agreements evidenced by a signed document that commits a firm dollar amount.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Human Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A medically qualified general practitioner acting as an agent of the (then) Department of Health examined the individual for medical eligibility for an Invalid Pension in 1973. "Mental retardation" is recorded under the diagnosis section of the Medical Report form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The form includes a medical history section, and some limited details were recorded. There is no reference to the use of any prescription drugs by the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am advised that the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) A full review has been conducted in relation to this case, and my Department has written three times to the individual concerned. The 1973 examination, a 1981 review, and a 1995 examination have all recommended that, on medical grounds, the person was eligible for pension benefits. Given the obvious difficulty in assessing events that occurred over twenty years ago, and the fact that at no point has this person been denied pension benefits, I can see no gain to be made in further reviewing this case.</PARA>
