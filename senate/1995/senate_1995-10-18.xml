<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was indicating the reasons why I opposed this reference to the Employment, Education and Training References Committee. The motion by Senator Hill relates to the issue of the proposed sale of Bond University to the University of Queensland. The proposition that is being advanced is that there should be a report back to the Senate on this matter by 23 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated yesterday that this was a proposition that ought not be inquired into on the basis, firstly, that it is not practical. It is not possible to have an adequate inquiry, given the extraordinary workload of this committee at the moment. I also indicated that it is not possible, given the nature of this inquiry, to have an adequate investigation of the proposal in the five-week period that is proposed, on the basis that, if these issues are so important, they do require a much more substantial investigation than a five-week period would allow in the normal course of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated that currently this committee has four inquiries running. There is a requirement to report in this period on two of those inquiries. This provides ample evidence that the secretariat is not able to deal with these issues in an adequate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest, in terms of the senators concerned, when you consider the workload that is involved with all the other committees they are involved in, given the estimates process is coming up, it is equally not possible for the senators to inquire into this matter in any way that one could describe as reasonable. This is a proposition that will not produce quality work. This is a proposition that flies in the face of good sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also indicated the government's view and my personal view that Australia has a very, very good record in the provision of quality public sector higher education. It has to be remembered, and I think it has to be emphasised, that the government's record on this matter is very, very good. In the period from 1983 to 1994 there has been a 68 per cent increase in the number of students attending universities. There has been a movement from 348,600 students in 1983 to 585,400 students in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of funding, there has been an increase of some 64 per cent, from $3.1 billion in 1983 to $5.1 billion in 1994. In this year's budget that funding will increase by a further $16.5 million over the next three years. There is a substantial growth in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal comes on the heels of an opposition proposition to oppose a further increase of some $20 million in revenue to higher education through the Higher Education Funding Act. It has to be seen in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also to be seen quite clearly that it cannot be done adequately under these arrangements. Therefore, one has to ask: why is it being proposed? Maybe it is the case that you do not need an inquiry. Maybe it is the case that you already have the report in your back pocket. Maybe it is the case that you have already made up your mind that there is a problem and you believe you have the answers to that problem. We have yet to hear it. Then again, we do not get to hear very much about solutions from the opposition on anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw this matter to the attention of the Senate in so far as this proposition was first advanced to my knowledge through the pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. On Wednesday, 6 September it was announced that the Senate standing committee was having an inquiry into this matter. There was no reference to the committee, no discussion within the committee, just a bland announcement that we are going to have an inquiry into this matter. I found out about the work of this committee through the pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It said that Senator Robert Hill had requested this inquiry. I do not recall his being a member of this committee. It indicated that Senator John Tierney, the chairman of this committee, had said that the proposed inquiry will investigate the full implication of university funding including the suitability of the public-private funding mixes. When the proposition was put to Senator Tierney, `What are you doing prejudging the work of the committee in this way,' he said, `I've been misquoted.'</PARA>

Of course, all of this was reported in the papers beforehand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the whole issue of what is the political intent here. This is why I say this proposed reference is in fact a recipe for yet another dirty little Senate inquiry. It is not about a proper investigation of a serious issue. It is not what is required, which is a proper investigation, of a very serious issue. It would take four or five months of committee work, not four or five weeks at the end of a busy session at a time when all of us are involved in so many other inquiries. At last count, I advised my office that I was on 12 separate inquiries. I have 12 inquiries running at the moment.

He wants to call committee meetings where he can try to pull a rort. He wants to call committee hearings at times when he can try to ram through bodgie reports, ill-considered and ill-conceived propositions, in a way which undermines the workings of this committee. As Senator Tierney has had explained to him, a bit of maturity is required here. Senator Tierney has to understand that, in terms of the working of this parliament, some parliamentary maturity is required. That is lacking here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see yet another politically inspired inquiry designed to provide a political platform in the run up to an election for the perceived interests of the coalition in terms of higher education. It is not about an objective analysis of a serious public policy issue; it is about party political advantage.

Senator Tierney was advised that there could be a proper inquiry into the full interface between the public and private sector, which I acknowledge is a serious issue. He was offered support for that inquiry, but he was not offered support for a five-week quickie or a five-week dirty election stunt, which is what he is proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggested that we have a proper inquiry into the full implications of public-private funding.

Let us have a look at that properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are not going to tell me for a moment that, given the enormous workload we all have with the estimates committees and various other inquiries, you will within a couple of hours of hearings&mdash;that is all you will ever get under this proposal&mdash;late at night be able to properly investigate whether or not the audit processes are adequate. The heart of the issue is whether or not the profile processes are adequate and whether DEET's examination of those profiles is adequate. You will not be able to do that properly. It is a farce. This is a ludicrous political stunt aimed at advancing what you believe to be a very narrow political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask ourselves whether we have heard anything about these things from the Liberals. The answer is a resounding no because your policy position in truth is the privatisation of higher education. The crocodile tears we see on the privatisation issue are designed to cover up the fraud that you are proposing to perpetrate on the Senate in terms of your alleged commitment to the public sector. You do not have a commitment to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You were saying that the government ought to be involved in what is essentially a contractual dispute. You are asking the Senate to become involved in a contractual dispute. You are essentially asking the government to take sides in a contractual dispute and you are using the Senate in an attempt to pressure one party to back off in a contractual dispute. That is improper. These bids that have been made are commercial-in-confidence. It is a ridiculous proposition to ask a minister to intervene in that process. It is a ridiculous proposition to ask the Senate to be involved in what is essentially a commercial-in-confidence process which is also before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are asking us to intervene in support of Bond University Ltd's legal action before the Queensland courts. That is improper. You have made no reference whatsoever to our current policy position. Every single public university in this country has a private corporate arm and you have made no comment about that whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, you said that Commonwealth money is involved. As I understand it, the public money involved in Bond University amounts to two awards: one is a student researcher who is receiving $28,000 for an Australian postgraduate research award; and the other involves a figure of $2,496 for an overseas postgraduate research scholarship. I understand that up to $60,000 might be allocated under the small grants program in 1995. That is the Commonwealth involvement. Massive, isn't it? We will spend more than that on this proposed inquiry!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that a major shift is occurring in the culture of higher education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague would only be too well aware of the fundamental issue in higher education policy and that is the question of whether or not a university should have autonomy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I suggest that you think again. This proposal is fundamentally flawed. In higher education under this government there has been a 68 per cent increase in the number of students attending university.

You are trying to cover up this very strong area of success for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your proposal is essentially aimed at trying to draw out some grubby political advantage in support of one side in a contractual dispute. You are trying to drag this Senate and this government into an essentially private contractual dispute that is currently before the courts.

Whereas that previous major change in 1987 was probably part of a natural evolution&mdash;one that has occurred overseas&mdash;this one is not. Therefore, it is a matter of considerable public importance that should be debated most fully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr has indicated that we should have a broader inquiry. I would also welcome such a broader inquiry. The problem is that we have a very specific problem in front of us, and a matter that has not been finally decided. If we do delay this matter, it will be too late for the parliament and for the Senate to put a view on this matter. I would suggest to Senator Carr that perhaps we do a two-part inquiry, of which Senator Hill's reference could form part one; that is, to look specifically at the narrower issue of the sale of Bond University. Part two could then be a broader inquiry dealing with the whole interface between public and private higher education. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What we have in this country is a very peculiar situation. We do not have a substantial private sector in higher education, and that is peculiar by international comparison. It is also peculiar by internal comparison with the high school systems in this country where we do have substantial private provision. The sum of $1.5 billion is spent by people in this country on the provision of private high school education. I would invite Senator Carr to think about what would happen if, suddenly overnight, all of those private schools disappeared. What would happen is that the government would have to stretch its resources out another $1.5 billion plus to cover that sort of provision. Obviously, that would then drain the state school system of resources. I would ask Senator Carr to reflect on what would happen in higher education if we did not have a substantial, robust and thriving private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means is exactly the same thing. We have to stretch public resources over an incredibly wide field and that is why you find classes oversize, libraries run down, insufficient infrastructure and insufficient money for research. It is because the public dollar has to be stretched so far. If you go to a country like the United States you find there is a long tradition of this private provision but I would have to add that the private provision is backed by public money as well. That has enabled the establishment of private universities like Stanford and has also enabled a thriving contribution not only to higher education but, indeed, to the whole American economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a third of the American higher education system is private. It goes back well over 100 years. It has become one of the major engine rooms of innovation and growth in the US economy, which leads the world. We do not have that&mdash;and we can only speculate on where our economy would be up to now if we had a hundred year tradition of private education in higher education in our country. We would have a much bigger higher education sector. With a private higher education system, we would have a situation where public provision could be better focused on the people who are now missing out on university and are trying to get in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was appalled when I came into the Senate and discovered that there were 50,000 students eligible to go to university who could not get in. The figure has come down to about half that, and that is most welcome; but there is still an enormous waste of the intellectual capital in this country when we turn away very large numbers of students. I put it to the government that one of the major reasons for this is that we do not have a robust private sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us describe this sector. We have a very tiny private sector compared with the public sector. There are almost half a million students in public education in our universities. Let us look at the private universities in comparison. Bond has 1,500 students; the Australian Catholic University has 8,000; and Notre Dame has a few hundred. The grand total is 10,000 against 500,000. This number is incredibly small. I have alluded to one of the reasons why it so small. We have not had a tradition in higher education of large numbers of people going through. In the high school system we certainly have had that, but not in the university system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out to the Senate another reason, which is particularly important to us because we are legislators. This has not developed and the institutions that have tried have had great difficulty because of a very hostile legislative environment to this sector. It contrasts greatly with the US where there is substantial public assistance to private universities, something like the substantial public assistance we give to our private schools.

I would have thought that my comments are amazingly relevant, so your interjection surprises me enormously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the point of the hostile legislative environment. It has been pointed out to me that there are great inconsistencies in the way in which the private universities that do exist are treated by the government and this is one reason why we have to start inquiring into this area. It has not been thought through. It really just grows like Topsy. They can gain access to some public money through ARC grants, but in terms of capital infrastructure money, they have no access to that. What is the rationale for doing one and not the other? There is no rationale, and that is why the government should actually shape this whole thing up better, have informed public policy, have considerable debate on it, and let us work out what the way forward is from this particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is being proposed and what is currently happening&mdash;and this is why this matter is so urgent&mdash;is that one of the universities, namely Bond, in its current form as a totally private university is about to disappear. The whole argument that I have been putting forward is the great need in this country to help encourage a private sector to flourish. This move, it seems, is in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason why I believe an inquiry is urgently needed is that there are a whole lot of issues that now arise over the acquiring of a private university by a public university that I do not believe have been fully thought through by the government. I want to refer to a number of these and in particular go back first of all to the speech by Senator Schacht yesterday on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr was a member of the inquiry into the ABC back in January of this year. We were assured that the ABC, as a public corporation, had set up a number of private ventures, like Broadcast News Australia, Australia Television International, AIM&mdash;the pay TV arm. These were commercial ventures and these were going to be totally isolated from public money. Within four months of that assurance to a Senate committee, we had evidence that there had been cross-subsidisation by bail-out because these operations were not working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference in this situation is that this is far more serious. With BNA and ATVI, you were looking at operations that were only worth about $5 million against a public budget of half a billion dollars. But here we are talking about whole universities buying other whole universities and there is a substantial amount of money involved&mdash;$100 million, if the newspaper reports are to believed. What happens if this venture gets into difficulties? The previous private owner, it is rumoured, lost a quarter of a billion dollars on Bond University. We have a very brave public university now taking over this venture and claiming there is not going to be any cross-subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also raises the question: if a public university can afford, through whatever means&mdash;and it could be its commercial arm or whatever&mdash;to raise $100 million for the purchase of Bond, why cannot it afford to do this and provide more research grants to its students, provide more places, improve the library, improve the infrastructure of the institution, get more overseas students in? Why cannot it direct its money in this way? Surely the government, which has a $4 billion investment each year in the public education system, should be concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue that this sale raises relates to what is going to happen in other universities. The minister assured us that none of them were going to follow suit. Yesterday the minister said that the purchase and operation of the Bond campus would not involve any kind of public money and that it would be quarantined. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think too many of them will, because I do not think too many of them are going to be able to raise $100 million on the risk market.</PARA>
<PARA>That is strange. If the University of Queensland can do it, Melbourne can do it, Sydney can do it, Adelaide can do it, Monash can do it, New South Wales can do it and, I would say, ANU can do it. If anything, a lot of those universities are in a much stronger position. That argument is an absolute nonsense. The minister goes on to say that he does not think people would be encouraged to risk their money. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but I presume after the Bond University example over the last few years there will not be a long list of investors . . . queuing up.</PARA>
<PARA>What I have just said about those other universities would put the lie to that. My guess is that the first one off the mark would be from Senator Carr's own state. Monash University was also a bidder and was quite prepared to do this. Griffith University is another university that was quite prepared to raise this sort of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monash is a very entrepreneurial university and has a whole lot of different arrangements. It could use surplus public capital. A possible scenario is that, at Gippsland or Chisholm, Monash University could establish a private institution. Nothing that the minister said yesterday would seem to stop that.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Institutions are prevented under the act from charging fees for undergraduate courses. However, an institution owning Bond University as a commercial venture would not be in breach of the act if Bond maintained a legally separate identity.</PARA>

It is on a fairly narrow reference, and that is the only other one we have to report on before the end of the year. Therefore, there is time to do a narrow focused inquiry into the Bond issue.

But I have indicated from the beginning that I do not think we can avoid the responsibility to inquire into this matter, which is one of some interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of compromise, I attempted to encourage the committee to receive evidence in private to enable it to get an understanding of the scope of the situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Minister Schacht made a contribution but I was still left with a great deal of uncertainty about the government's position, the government's consideration of this, what actual policy direction we would end up in or, more importantly, what policy position would apply to universities. We were told by Minister Schacht that a number of other universities around the country&mdash;if not all universities&mdash;had some sort of private enterprise attachment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question there, of course, is: do those private attachments have the capacity to award degrees?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This further step begs the question: what is it that will be conferred by the private university which is owned by the public university? What implications does it have for articulation and recognition of prior learning&mdash;a couple of the catch phrases that are used in education at the moment. In higher education there is a welcome movement towards, as I am sure most senators would know, more recognition of the prior learning that has been undertaken by a student for a degree and the articulation of some studies from some institutions into other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because there is that movement, we will have to be very careful about what the implications are in the ownership of a private institution by a public institution for cross-subsidisation and for confusion of public money with private. If that path is apparently separate and apparently at arms-length, then we have to pursue this question: what implications are there for the recognition of previous studies in one institution for another and what is it that is finally conferred by the private part of the public university?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial implications, of course, we have been assured, will be separate and at arms-length. I am reminded, in the first instance, of the answer to the question from Senator Kernot yesterday about the AIDC and the government's interest there. The government claimed, through Minister Cook, to not have any capacity to be involved in this apparently private enterprise arrangement. Even though the government had agency ownership, there was no capacity to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are matters of concern to the public which are occurring in the private part of the Queensland University, does the government have the capacity to intervene? Should it intervene? If what is occurring is not in accordance with government policy, where does the responsibility start and stop? This is another key question in this whole clever arrangement that we see emerging in so much of the corporatisation and privatisation debate. Accountability seems to disappear. We have very little capacity in this chamber to question ministers about the things which are publicly owned but are `private'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of questions which, I think, should arise in the inquiry and deserve to be investigated further by the inquiry. It is the implications for the way this country is going and what the public gets for its taxpayers' dollar. Who is actually funding this purchase? Will there be any further cost to the government or the public? What guarantees do we have that it will remain in private ownership? What is private ownership? There are so many blurred edges around these questions that I think we really do need to be supporting the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr was keen to interject while the previous speaker was making a contribution that Bond University had lost several hundred million dollars. What guarantees do we have that under the ownership of the Queensland university similar losses will not continue? If so, what are the implications for the public of such losses? We had a guarantee not so long ago regarding a private enterprise undertaking by a publicly owned organisation. The ABC's venture into ATI was supposed to be at arm's-length and not involve any additional expenses to the public. I cannot remember the exact amount but millions of dollars found its way through some path or other from the core funding of the ABC over to ATI, and that had implications. I think we are seeing it now with the closure of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. I am sure that those senators who represent regional Australia would be most concerned about that. </PARA>

So I see a trail. We should inquire what means and measures have been taken to prevent that trail being repeated. We have been told that it is quarantined, that it is completely separate management.

In many instances some universities feel the need to go into debt to attract overseas student or to export education services. We see some risk taking being seen as part of what universities do&mdash;the new corporate image. Some universities are doing well in terms of their ability to incorporate a corporate structure; some are not doing so well.

By looking at the instance that we see before us, maybe some of those more important principles will come out and will at least be on the record for when other instances occur in the future that may well involve government or what are currently 100 per cent government institutions now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens recognise that the government has reasons for its feelings of urgency in regard to the sale of assets. On a procedural basis, it may well have a case in terms of the urgency. However, in relation to the airport sale bills, we want to find out just how much time the community throughout Australia has had to look at the ramifications of a very important level of privatisation. Airports are extremely important to a vast number of people, not the least of which the people living around airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been advised by the department that, yes, there had been extensive consultation, but the list in fact only relates to some peak bodies and people living around the Sydney area. This might be fine but the privatisation bill actually enables privatisation of airports right throughout Australia. That is the important issue. People in Western Australia are only beginning to realise&mdash;it is only beginning to hit the community&mdash;that this means them and just about every airport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That level of consultation has not taken place across the states; it has taken place only, if you like, where the noise is loudest. It is legitimate that government should address that level of obvious community concern but for people in Western Australia, for instance, in relation to the Perth airport, it means that they may be presented with a fate accompli. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might not be obvious to a lot of people that there is a third runway proposal for Perth. Currently the plans show two parallel runways and another east-west runway. Funnily enough, that is what was presented to the people in Sydney and that is not how it ended up. Here we are going to have various stages of privatisation and later on people will say that they were misinformed or ill-informed or not given the full picture. We will then have to deal with safety issues, community noise issues, inconvenience and all sorts of other things as well as the very real issues that are involved with trashing heritage listed wooded wetlands, which is exactly what would happen if you put the third runway in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well at the moment that the community in Perth is being presented with stages one and two, which have `minimal environmental impact', which is debatable. Privatisation might or might not lead to a third runway. We should have learnt all of these things from Sydney, but we did not. What the government says is an appropriate level of community consultation is actually not an appropriate level of community consultation. There will be a lot of very annoyed electors in Western Australia when they work out what we are being asked to consider before they have even had a chance to look at the ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of wooded wetlands, we know we have a chance to make some representation to CEPA when it is still fully under government control. What consultation will occur on those kinds of issues once it is privately leased and so on? Therefore, for procedural reasons we do not think the government has satisfied the concerns that are associated with this kind of very important legislation. There must be community consultation so that whatever decisions are made by either side of the parliament those community concerns are actually taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the Australian National Line, once again the government may well have legitimate reasons that it believes relate to the possible sale. It may have gone far enough in respect of a sale. It may well find itself in a difficult position if it does not have a legislative basis for what it is already negotiating to do. However, there is still a committee working on the Australian National Line, and it has not yet reported. It seems strange, considering the lack of assistance the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) gave in allowing the committee to look at the ramifications of the sale of ANL, that this will go ahead without that committee having the chance to report. </PARA>

I do not want to debate the issue in general, but I point out that there has been a great deal of concern and outcry from residents in Sydney and other parts of the country about the effect of airport noise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the motion currently before us seeks to exempt certain measures from a resolution of the Senate of 29 November 1994. That resolution of the Senate specifically states, `Where the government wishes the Senate to depart from that general chronological priority'&mdash;in other words, exempt the legislation as it is trying to do here&mdash;`the government should justify each such departure in debate which concludes with a resolution of agreement by the Senate.' What I said and what I stand by is that that has not been done in debate. I acknowledge that the sheets were circulated and I had a look at them; but it was not done in debate. I thought I had missed something out. But this is a matter, seriously, of order and I rise on the point of order, firstly, whether you would rule, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the words `in debate' mean in debate in this chamber and that the government seek to justify each departure from that resolution in debate at the commencement of that debate. So there are two things that I rise to order that should be done in debate. In fairness, it should be done by the minister at the commencement of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I understand that the government has given prior notice as a matter of courtesy and that the minister will be expanding on those issues that have been previously circulated during his closing of the debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was outlining the way in which the government complies with the spirit of this order of the Senate. I think Senator Harradine has acknowledged&mdash;and I appreciate that&mdash;that statements of reasons have been made available on a number of occasions on the key bills that are before us. I might also make the point that the debate we are having at the moment really did not gain a great deal of focus until Senator Harradine moved an amendment specifically in relation to the two airports bills. We have had two speakers previously in the debate. I acknowledge that those particular bills were of concern to both Senator Bourne and Senator Margetts&mdash;they made that clear in their contributions. But there was no suggestion that there should be any bills deleted from the list until Senator Harradine formally moved an amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the spirit of what Senator Bourne said when she indicated that she was looking forward to the arguments that the government would be presenting and also in the spirit of what Senator Harradine has put forward let me, as briefly as I can but to ensure that we do this with total thoroughness, go to the key bills that you raised in your contributions a moment ago. In relation to the Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill, these bills establish a regulatory framework and provide for the leasing process of the 22 federal airports currently owned by the Federal Airports Corporation and Sydney West airport. This is a major policy initiative, which the government believes will further enhance the development of a vital part of Australia's transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By ensuring continuing government controls over key functions such as planning, pricing and, importantly, environmental management, the bills ensure that the public interest will not be compromised by commercial considerations. It was not possible to introduce this legislation earlier as the complexity of the legislation required extensive community consultation. The finalisation of the bills follows the same extensive consultation process with a range of interested parties including states, territories, local government, the aviation industry, community groups and potential investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the ANL Sale Bill 1995, it is proposed that the ANL Sale Bill be passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate during the 1995 spring sittings of the parliament. The bill is to facilitate a sale of the Commonwealth shares in ANL Ltd to P&amp;O Australia Ltd, a sale which has been deferred pending a satisfactory outcome from negotiations between ANL, unions and P&amp;O on ANL's future industrial arrangements. That was announced on 31 August this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation will be necessary to effect the sale, given the terms of the draft agreement for the sale of the Commonwealth shares, an agreement which has been negotiated with P&amp;O. The draft sale agreement provides that P&amp;O need not complete the agreement if the legislation has not been passed by both houses of parliament by the end of October 1995. There is, therefore, a considerable risk that the opportunity for a sale will be lost if the Commonwealth is not in a position to complete this process by that time. There is also a risk that P&amp;O may not follow through with its offer if the bill is opposed or its passage is not facilitated as soon as possible.The passage of the sale legislation is, therefore, urgent and essential to enable a sale to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was not introduced earlier as government decisions about a possible sale of ANL were made by the cabinet only at the end of August. The bill is also inextricably linked to the terms of the draft sale agreement with P&amp;O. Final negotiations on this lasted until near the end of August. So it is for those reasons that those bills are included with the others to which attention has not been drawn. I accept that there is a general view amongst senators that the case that has been made in the statement of reasons provided to senators has been accepted in the case of the other legislation proposed to be before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I just want to say that the coalition will not oppose the passage of this motion which will allow debate on these bills, because we think it is in the best interests of the nation that the legislation progress. However, it will not surprise the minister that we are frustrated by the incompetence of this government in not bringing these bills to the parliament at an earlier date. I talk specifically of the proposal to lease the airports, which should have been done long ago, and the ANL sale which we have argued should have been done a long time ago. After nearly 14 years of government it is not surprising, I guess, that they have become slow and tired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government that was sharp and on the ball would have recognised the value to the Australian people of progressing such issues as privatisation of airports and the sale of ANL, which is costing the Australian taxpayer an enormous amount of money, and would have taken action far before this day and far before the eve of the election. This last desperate attempt by this government to demonstrate some sort of agenda of microeconomic reform is really quite pathetic. But, consistent with that, we cannot therefore come in here and say, `Just because you have been incompetent in your programming, we are not going to let you debate the bills.' We in fact say that you should be getting on with the job and should have in fact got on with the job a long time ago. For those reasons, we will not be opposing the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the airports, in fact, as government and the people know, we believe that those bills should be passed with a couple of amendments, excluding Kingsford Smith airport until the east-west runway is reopened and elevating Adelaide to the first tranche. I do not know what this government has got against South Australia, but why they chose to prejudice the economic redevelopment of South Australia by relegating Adelaide to the second tranche is something that I do not understand. Perhaps they just do not appreciate the economic mess that the Bannon government left in my home state and perhaps it is an unwillingness to deal in a constructive way with the new government of South Australia, the Brown government, which is re-building the economic base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, of course, be seeking an amendment to that effect to give South Australia an even chance with the other states of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before us, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, has undergone dramatic change in recent weeks. I am pleased that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, picked that point up in the way in which it is being dealt with. In fact, I will deal with that as we go through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the original omnibus bill is scarcely recognisable today. The original bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 March this year and it proposed to: firstly, change the way export inspection charges are imposed on certain fish exports in accordance with industry wishes to ensure equity; secondly, remove the need to register wool tax payments on sales of small amounts of wool to apply mainly to hobby farmers and others who occasionally remit small amounts of wool; and, thirdly, provide a rollover of wool tax collected for research and development in one year to later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true that the bill remains committed to these objectives, the coalition questions the government's motives in now introducing a swag of very last minute amendments. As the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, has just alluded to, these new amendments radically alter the entire intent of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new amendments seek to: firstly, allow the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to continue its role in chemical residue monitoring and education; secondly, give the minister the power to set charges to recover the cost of monitoring compliance with the conditions attached to woodchip export licences issued by the Commonwealth; and thirdly, include a series of administrative amendments to rectify the unintended consequences of the cessation of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 on 30 June this year. As the minister rightly pointed out, there are now three major amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, and I will deal with these later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that these amendments are not merely technical or housekeeping amendments, as you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, alluded to and presumed would have come up in the normal committee stage. The government has put forward these amendments and they represent significant new initiatives, and, as such, the government has an obligation to allow time for consultation and scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We became aware that the government intended to move down this path on the last sitting day of the previous fortnight. Its motives were questioned and treated with suspicion by the Australian Democrats, by others and by myself when we saw the range of the new initiatives that were proposed, that had not been canvassed with any of us and that had not gone through the process of proper scrutiny by the shadow cabinet or party room debates in this area. So the government walked away from its obligation of consulting, which it normally does with processing in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, after much wheeling and dealing in the last week of the last sitting fortnight, won that two-week reprieve to allow the new material to be examined in detail. While we support the original bill and the new government amendments that have been flagged today, we certainly did not support the way in which the government has ambushed this legislation in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just now had for the first time an attempt at an additional second reading speech. The minister comes in and makes some comments in a very cursory way about adding new principles. Many parliamentarians and people outside the parliament have not seen copies of the new proposed legislation and have not had access to the explanatory memorandum. I certainly ask the minister to explain in his summing up any consultation process and the motives for bringing in this sort of legislation in this sort of manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became very apparent to me in the wheeling and dealing of the last two or three weeks that obviously, in putting this legislation forward, it must have been tacked on in some way, both by cabinet and by caucus; and it certainly highlighted a number of differences between the ministers, Senator Collins and Mr Beddall, that have been going on as part of this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to reflect on the original bill for a moment. The legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives proposes changes to the way export inspection charges are imposed on certain fish exports. Currently fish exporters pay a range of fees and charges to AQIS, including $15 per tonne of fish exported. Until now this fee has not been payable on exports through brokers. This legislation aims to close the loophole and ensure brokers and others pay their share of fees. It also reduces the tonnage fee from $15 to $10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Turning to wool, it is worth noting that when this important industry was restructured, with the cooperation of the coalition, the government promised that Wool International would be privatised, most likely in 1997. It also promised that growers who paid wool tax for debt repayment between July 1993 and the date of privatisation would be given shares in the privatised company. Equity was to be determined by calculating the amount of wool tax payable by growers during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool tax, for the purposes of debt servicing and repayment, is set at 4.5 per cent of sale price. However, the wool industry has grown increasingly concerned about the cost of registering the name and address of every person who sells a small amount of wool, particularly those who sell less than $500 per year. This legislation provides for regulations to specify an amount below which Wool International will not be required to automatically register wool tax payments. Individuals, however, can continue to register payments by request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 is to be amended to allow the board of AWRAP to meet outside Australia. This is appropriate in light of the amalgamation between AWRAP and the International Wool Secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment brings the manner of paying research and development funds for wool into line with other research and development corporations by providing a rollover provision. This will ensure that the government matches dollar for dollar the amount contributed by woolgrowers for research and development up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the government amendments that have been put forward today&mdash;and that is the only way we can describe them. Earlier I outlined the main provision of the government amendments. I turn specifically to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. These amendments seek to ensure that persons conducting offshore petroleum operations under the act respect and do not unduly interfere with native title rights and interests when conducting those operations; strengthen the minister's ability to make safety regulations under the act; and give legal force to the system of awarding offshore petroleum exploration permits to ensure that it is fully effective and adequately protects the rights of explorers. This final point is worth considering in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Petroleum (Submerged lands) Act of 1967 the federal government awards permits for companies to undertake offshore petroleum exploration in specified areas under the guaranteed work program bidding system. However, a loophole has emerged that potentially allows holders of exploration permits to surrender their permits at any time. This has caused a crisis of confidence in the bidding system. The purpose of amendments now before the Senate is to guarantee that agreed work programs will be carried out. The amendments do not vary the criteria on which bids for work programs are decided and should have no influence on the outcome of outstanding bids. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association supports this move and, more importantly, the resumption of the award of exploration permits by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the federal coalition supports this legislation, we wish to place on record our criticism of the government's handling of this bill in the Senate by ambushing the legislation with a swag of last minute amendments that not only amended but totally transformed the bill. That point needs to be stressed. The government has revealed a dangerous disregard for proper parliamentary scrutiny. We trust that this is not a sign of things to come, particularly now as the government panics with its own legislative program&mdash;we have just seen that in the previous debate&mdash;in the lead-up to an election that the Australian Labor Party surely knows that it will lose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would have to agree somewhat with Senator Tambling's concerns about the timing and methods used in bringing this legislation to the chamber. This omnibus bill amends bits of legislation and has been put into the Senate after the original bill was circulated. This legislation now contains Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act amendments and a few amendments to other acts which it did not originally contain. That brings some difficulties to those of us who want to contribute to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally this was outside any portfolio interest I had and any responsibility I had to comment. But now I see an opportunity to contribute, and that is what I will do. I will focus on schedule 5, the Export Control Act of 1982, which the government wants to amend to impose licence fees in connection with monitoring compliance on hardwood woodchip export licences. Those who have paid any attention to any of the work that I have done in this place would recognise my ongoing interest in and concern about the monitoring of the practices that are involved in deriving the subject of the woodchip export licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we believe the principle of this amendment is sound and looks great and that it may go a tiny way towards making friends with some angry conservationists, the Democrats are cynical about the commitment of the government to actually do the monitoring and the prosecuting when there are breaches of licence conditions. We have had to push the government into investigating one saw miller in Tasmania, Barry Arnold, when there were clear breaches in Tasmania. We have had to force documentation from the government, like blood from a stone, about breaches in Western Australia. We have had to rub the nose of the government in the fact that there were breaches in the Wombat forest in Victoria. We have had to do that with no assistance in terms of resources or research opportunities from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These several examples are perhaps the tip of the iceberg. Perhaps they are typical of common occurrences. We do not know. We cannot know. The government should know. What does it take to get this government to actively seek out licence offenders and to prosecute them for their offences? We have little faith in the government's commitment to prosecuting and persisting in the actions which are necessary to find out who should be prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year Mr Beddall made a commitment to Australia on 20 December to have tough monitoring conditions. He has not kept that promise. He deferred the implementation of the establishment of the monitoring unit and, despite his promise in December last year with the 1995 licence, I hear he is going to re-announce it all again this year for the 1996 licences, in other words taking two bites at the same cherry, which has not even been produced yet. I do not know how we can believe him this time around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, the Democrats will agree to the government amendment. We could hardly do anything else. We need to see some action from the government straight away, when there are offences occurring. I do not want to have to take the trouble to stand here again and draw the minister's attention over and over again to breaches in licences which his department should be discovering. I do not want to have to force him to act because he has been embarrassed by the Australian Democrats over the issue. If there is a commitment the government, of its own volition, ought to be able to determine where the breaches are and take the appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am thankful that this chamber provides a forum for us to demonstrate where the breaches are. I am thankful that we have a democracy so that such a responsibility can be accepted by people like me. That should not be the way it works. If the government was committed to doing its job&mdash;following up on its own policies, enforcing its own laws and monitoring them&mdash;there would be no reason for people like me to have to accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have one amendment to this bill. While the government has the Export Control Act open on the table for amendment, we would like to amend it in line with Labor policy as stated by two Prime Ministers, Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating. On 12 March 1991 Prime Minister Hawke made the `Building A Competitive Australia' statement. We would all be familiar with the statements made. He made this one in conjunction with the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, and the then industry minister, Senator Button. I quote from that statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be provision in the legislation to establish plantations for long term timber supply. The objective is to phase out woodchip exports by the year 2000 or soon after and replace them with value added products. This new emphasis will take pressure off our native forests.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from Prime Minister Hawke. On 22 December 1994 in his position as Prime Minister, Mr Keating gave that commitment again, although he was a little more subdued and qualified. It was not in the effusive style of Mr Hawke. Prime Minister Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the year 2000 the Government will ban the export of woodchips from those areas of Australia's native forests which are not covered by Regional Forest Agreements incorporating a Reserve System that comprehensively represents all forest types.</PARA>
<PARA>Our amendment simply seeks to put this worthy ALP policy statement into legislation and seeks to prevent the export of woodchips from natural native forests by the year 2000. Since it is the stated policy of two Prime Ministers, I look forward to support from the ALP. It should support its own policy. In the committee stage I will move the amendment which has been circulated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief on this matter. There are a couple of points I would like to make in addressing the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). It seeks to amend the Wool International Act 1993 to make provision for the regulations to specify an amount below which Wool International is not required to automatically register wool payments. I understand that that figure will be about $200. There has to be a figure, as far as I am concerned, because small amounts of wool come in at odd times. There is one bale here, two bales there and three bales there. What you have to remember is that probably those sellers will be around every year, even though they produce a small amount. I believe Wool International has to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I remember rightly, some $2 million to $5 million was spent by its forerunner on computer equipment before the collapse of the reserve price scheme. We were supposed to have a wool quota scheme. Can anyone remember that? It was about two or three years ago. A heap of computer equipment was purchased for that wool quota system. I understand it was used very little. So it would not be beyond the realm of possibility for Wool International to get a bit more organised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have declared my interest in the wool industry. I have also noticed that ever since this new system came in on 1 July 1993 you seem to finish up with a new wool tax number with every clip that is sold. I believe Wool International is not doing enough to sort out its own house in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least once a year, or maybe twice a year, you are sent a form giving you your new wool information number&mdash;WIN is the proper term for it. They tell you that if you have any other numbers, you should consolidate them&mdash;there is a place on the form to consolidate the numbers you already have. Every time you get one of those forms you complete them to consolidate those numbers. Even when the new number is consolidated, the next time you sell a clip or a portion of a clip, even if it is 10 or 20 bales or whatever, you get another number. So they have a lot of work to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is they have been silly. When filing in alphabetical order, they sometimes use the trading name, the surname or the first initial of the person concerned. For example, if there is a trading name of R.B. Jones and Co., sometimes they will file it under Jones and sometimes they will file it under `R' because that is the first initial. In this day and age that is a totally ridiculous situation. Wool International has to clean up its own house rather than impose limits for registering under under a certain amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When wool goes to auction, Wool International could ask for or demand an existing Wool International number. In other words, there would be a specification that the existing number be provided when wool goes on to the floor for sale&mdash;and most wool growers in Australia would have an existing number. Therefore, even if only one bale was sold, there would be no confusion with the minimal wool tax because credits would be made automatically rather than the growers having to request that amounts under $200, or whatever the figure may be, be credited against their name. If there was provision to ask for that number, all those sorts of problems would be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time Australian wool growers and Australia as a whole started to ask Wool International how the new scheme to get rid of the stockpile is working. Everyone involved in the rural industry will remember the collapse of the reserve price scheme and the fact that Wool International was set up and charged to unload the stockpile of some five million bales. So far it has worked reasonably well. The stockpile is now down to 2.8 million bales, and the price for wool going onto the export market, or wherever, is still reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of late, Wool International has found it a bit difficult to forward sell its 185,000 bales per quarter&mdash;I think that is the right figure. A minor fiasco was caused last May when Wool International started unloading the wool at a fairly hefty discount as the sales for the season finished and there was that two-month break. I believe that the discount at the time was too heavy. That meant that when the market opened in August the price moved down far too quickly. It took a lot of value out of the woolclip. China's absence from the market, hopefully only temporarily, caused some of that concern and therefore the prices dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International has to really look at how it is going and see how it will handle future sales. It has put some wool on the auction market. I believe the proposition of putting wool that has been compressed into small bales on the auction floor is not very attractive. There are problems with the industry. Those problems are a big worry for the Australian wool industry, which has suffered a downturn of 200c a kilogram since last May. It is also a worry for Australia as a whole. It worries farmers who owe the banks a certain amount that their incomes will be cut further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot fix the price of wool from here, but we can point out that certain aspects of Wool International need to be looked at. I was the biggest supporter of the new scheme to unload the 185,000 bales per quarter. Hopefully we will get to the situation where there is no stockpile, or a minimum stockpile; because one of the lessons learnt from the late 1980s and early 1990s is that there will never be another stockpile in Australia as a result of the reserve price scheme. That scheme should have been wound up a lot earlier than it was. There are problems that have to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The representatives of the growers have to look at what they are doing. The Wool Council of Australia, a subcommittee of the National Farmers Federation, has been involved in negotiations with Wool International on an ongoing basis. The week before last Wool International gave the Wool Council of Australia a very important briefing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pastoralists and Graziers Association in Western Australia, which I happen to be a member of, has been asking for a while what Wool International and the Wool Council are doing. The representative of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association was excluded from the confidential briefing that Wool International gave the Wool Council of Australia two weeks ago simply because of comments he had made. I am not ashamed to say that this person is Barry Court. Whether he was excluded because he is the brother of the present Premier of Western Australia I do not know. I do not think so. I presume he was excluded because of the comments he made as the representative of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, which I consider to be the best representative of the wool industry in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very annoyed that the Wool Council of Australia and the NFF agreed to have this confidential briefing when one person was excluded. I believe that the Wool Council of Australia should not have accepted the briefing when one of the members of the council, Barry Court, was excluded. I believe the Wool Council should have had the guts and gumption to say, `No, you can keep your confidential briefing until all the nominated members of the Wool Council of Australia are present.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put those few remarks on the record because I believe the Australian wool industry has a big future. It has provided a lot of export income for Australia in the last 180-odd years even though we have run into difficulties at various times. I know there were difficulties in the mid-1950s and the early 1970s and we now face difficulties in mid-1990s. These difficulties can be overcome and the wool industry can still return to its proper place in Australia; but we cannot go along with our minds shut. If it is necessary to finetune this legislation, which was instituted two years ago to unload Australia's wool stockpile, then let's do it. I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation (Amendment) Bill which, as all other speakers have noted, is an omnibus bill which amends certain administrative elements of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. However, this second reading debate gives us an opportunity to speak on broader matters relating to our very vital primary industries. Given that the health of the Australian economy very much depends on our primary industry and our rural sector, it is worth spending some time on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixty-one per cent of Australia's export earnings are still derived, essentially, from the efforts and the production of those in the rural and regional areas. To put that in perspective and demonstrate its importance, Australia's ratio for primary industry exports, at 61 per cent&mdash;and this is an OECD figure&mdash;dwarfs the OECD average of 19 per cent. So you can see that Australia still very much rides on our rural industries. Specifically, the farm sector contributes 25 per cent of our export earnings. I believe that would go up to 30 per cent inclusive of forestry and the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often readily acknowledged in this chamber that Australia's improved manufacturing contribution really stems from our rural sector. Our export earnings are predominantly in food value adding and, of course, all the raw materials come from our farm sector. Regrettably, the underlying fundamentals of the farm economy are still very poor. Many regions of Australia are still in drought and many are teetering on the edge of drought suffering all those consequences of that natural disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great long-term effects of the drought is and will be for some time to come the farm debt problem that we have in this country. The main cause of the accumulation of farm debt over the past decade has been spiralling interest rates. During the 1980s interest rates on farm overdrafts hovered around the 20 per cent mark. Due to several poor seasons on top of the recession, farmers were unable to trade their way out of this problem, as you would expect. In fact, even today the figures are poor and getting worse. The 1994-95 ABARE statistics farm survey report found that the average farm debt increased in that year some four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So even out of a recession and into a so-called recovery, farm debt has still been on the rise by some four per cent in the last 12 months to an average of $145,000, while profitability of farms, the ability to service that debt, has fallen from 64 per cent to 46 per cent. In gross terms&mdash;the larger figure&mdash;the Australian farm debt has reached some $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present rate of compounding farm debt, the number of farmers will be likely to fall below the 100,000 mark by the year 2000, which will surely trigger a collapse in many of the services in our rural towns and trigger a population exodus. On a practical level, a continual exodus from our rural sector will place great burdens upon the major urban and metropolitan areas. This was the very point made by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, when he signalled a great concern about the extreme pressures on the services of Sydney simply because there is a cramming of the population into the Sydney metropolitan area. Hence, any significant decline in our non-metropolitan areas really does affect metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the raw statistics that measure the seriousness of the decline in the number of our family farms. In March 1982, there were some 174,466 farms&mdash;predominantly family farmers&mdash;and by a decade later, in March 1992, Australian farm numbers had collapsed to 122,053, and that figure is continuing to tumble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We so often hear from the government the concept of a new-age farmer with high tech machinery and a computerised business operation, but that is not happening. In fact, the new-age farmer is failing under the weight of debt and falling income. The average tractor age, which is always a good benchmark, is some 13 years; yet the tractor is the most used and productive piece of machinery on all farms. That is why it is such a good benchmark but at that rate the tractors will be declared vintage. Yet the worth of the family farmer as an efficient, social and economic unit is measurable. A factor recognised by both sides of the house is that the family farmer is a tangible asset to Australia's economic and social wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A report on the adequacy of the rural adjustment scheme and the extent of rural debt was handed down by my National Party colleague Senator Brownhill, who is chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee.

I would like to refer to one witness who came before that committee, Sister Marjorie Hennessy. She pretty well summed up the ongoing concerns in rural Australia when she expressed her concerns about the longer term implications of the current rural crisis. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are losing skill and expertise of thousands of farmers. Farmers are dispossessed, families are displaced, millions of hectares of lands are being reallocated and we are not sure to whom . . . A kind of a social revolution is taking place without our knowledge or our full realisation that this is so.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Party&mdash;indeed, the coalition&mdash;has been extremely aware of this seemingly insurmountable financial crisis facing the rural sector. To that end, the coalition&mdash;as announced by my leader, Tim Fischer, on 8 October&mdash;will as an absolute priority in the first 100 days of a coalition government bring together a rural financial crisis summit to address the problems that agriculture faces in rebuilding after the drought and after the recession. I quote from the speech that my leader gave:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The summit will be convened within the first 100 days of a coalition government. It will address the immediate effects and consequences of the drought, but its primary focus will be on the longer term financial structure facing agriculture. The farm sector is famous for its ability to recover from drought. But this time around, so many farms went into several years of drought in such poor financial circumstances&mdash;thanks to the high interest rates of the late 1980s&mdash;that there is a real doubt about their viability to fund a recovery. This is now a national problem because of the implications it holds for regional communities and the environment in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA>That should also be a concern to the Greens senators in this chamber. Interrelated with the debt plight of the rural sector has been the decline over the past decade or more in the terms of trade for farmers. The National Farmers Federation estimate that business margins for Australian farmers have dropped by more than 90 per cent in the past 40 years. To put that in perspective, the Victorian Farmers Federation have said that, as a rule of thumb, to buy a new Holden ute in 1974 would have cost 12 bales of wool or 41 tonnes of wheat but, 20 years later in 1994, the same Holden ute would cost 42 bales of wool or 177 tonnes of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE forecast farm costs for 1995-96 are set to rise by some 5.2 per cent, far outstripping their forecast for price increases of 1.8 per cent. I have to think, now that we are well into the 1995-96 year, that the estimate that costs would rise by 5.2 per cent was conservative. I would say, from anecdotal evidence, that it is far more than that. What it means is that farmers' profit margins will continue to trend down and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even for the most buoyant of farmers, like the dairy farmers in Gippsland who have seen some good seasons of late where debt and drought are of less concern to them, the great complaint is related to continual rising costs and overheads to operate the farm against the very negligible rise in prices. As a measure of the cost structures farmers face within a particular sector we need only look to the beef industry. The high cost structures of this industry affect not only the prices farmers receive for their product, but the volume they are able to export overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The root of this problem has been debated in the chamber before: basically the abattoir costs&mdash;production costs. The figures I take are from the Booz Allen and Hamilton report that was recently tabled in this parliament by the minister. It states that on a per kilo finished weight basis, the cost of our meat processing is highly uncompetitive. For Australia the cost is 113c per kilo; for Argentina&mdash;one of our major competitors, if not our major competitor&mdash;it is 105c per kilo; for New Zealand, just across the waters, it is 72c per kilo; and for the United States it is 41c per kilo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reached an absurd situation last year when the United States-owned Sizzler chain of restaurants decided to import United States beef into Australia around Christmas time because that was cheaper than buying it here. They were able to supply all their chains throughout Australia with United States beef. Even though they were paying the American farmer 60 per cent more for beef than they were paying the Australian farmer, they were still able to bring it to this country cheaper than they could buy it in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sizzler were able to buy beef from the American farmer for 60 per cent more, put it through their own abattoirs, move it to their wharfs, ship it across the Pacific and then onto our wharfs, pass meat inspection and then distribute it through the Sizzler restaurant chain still cheaper than the Australian industry can provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For further evidence of this absurdity you have only to look at the growing trend of meat exports. So expensive are the Australian abattoirs and processing chains that it is now a far more viable option to export live cattle to Asia. This is a growing trend. Backing up the Booz Allen and Hamilton report, the government's own Industry Commission report on the meat processing sector says that if we brought in fundamental change to the cost structures, we would have savings of some $1.5 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the American industry being able to export beef to this country&mdash;getting it past their wharves and our wharves&mdash;more cheaply than the Australians can produce it. There is another great cost for the Australian beef farmer and the Australian farmer in general. Australian farmers have to compete with the world market when they simply cannot get product past our wharves without 50 percent, 60 per cent, sometimes even 100 percent, being added on to the cost. Australian wharves are so inefficient. The Bureau of Industry Economics, in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Benchmarking&mdash;Waterfront 1995</EMPHASIS>, has this to say about just one indicator of how inefficient Australian wharves are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest concern with Australia's performance must lie with stevedoring productivity where crane rates . . . declined during 1994 and fell back to around 1991-92 levels</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crane rates at the best performing Australian container terminal (18.5 moves per hour at Fremantle) is equivalent to some of the poorest performances in Europe&mdash;and in America. How can our rural sector possibly compete internationally when our wharves are that inefficient?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third underlying fundamental problem in the farming sector, having touched on debt and farm costs, is, of course, our competitiveness on international markets. Great promise was held out to the farming sector with the introduction of GATT and the World Trade Organisation that hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, would be coming their way. The farming sector undertook great restructuring at a very high price to meet the demands of the World Trade Organisation. Of course, it is now looking increasingly like they are being let down. They will be let down unless we have a very firm government with conviction to protect our rural sector from the fix that it is in. We have been let down by some of our closest allies, no less, in the market. The United States, of course, are backing up their rural sector with various and different export enhancement programs, in the dairy and wheat industries in particular. Regardless of commitments made, they are intruding on our Asian and Middle Eastern markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is incumbent upon the government, then, to vigorously oppose these moves and to stand up for our farming sector on every stage and at every conference possible. That is why it is a great disappointment that the government have seen fit to withdraw our ambassador from the United States. If that is the worth that the government places on his appointment, probably he should never have gone there. They have withdrawn him at short notice, at such a crucial time of negotiations with APEC and the WTO, simply on political grounds. What they should have done in the beginning was to appoint someone for the long term for the good of the Australian farm sector who would represent us in Washington and would not be a fly-by-night like the current ambassador to America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All in all, the farm sector still needs a great deal of focus and concentration. It does seem, as former Senator Richardson put it very well in one of his articles, that this government has no concern for the farm sector, because it does not vote for them. They do not believe they will get any more than one per cent of the Australian rural sector voting for them. That has been shown over the last decade or more of this government. It is time for a change. We have made a commitment that, within the first 100 days of a new government, a financial summit recognising the seriousness of the problems of the rural sector will be held and certain policies will be formulated and help given to the rural sector to make it viable for the next decade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a most serious concern for all Australian primary industries, and that is the issue of quarantine policy. In 1988, the Labor government changed its quarantine policy from no risk to an acceptable or minimal risk. Minimal risk is considered to be the point at which the potential risk posed to the nation by a proposed import is small enough to be manageable. AQIS, in making this decision, must, firstly, consider the biological factors and, secondly, the economic and social consequences that flow from the biological considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another relevant factor in quarantine policy is that under GATT a country cannot use its quarantine policy as a non-tariff barrier. Quarantine standards must be justified on a scientific basis. I raise these changes to our quarantine policy in the context of loud concerns from many Australian primary industries. Many have had draft papers prepared by AQIS, which relax quarantine measures and will, in effect, allow imports from a wide range of countries. They are often smaller primary industries, with all of them pointing to the very real risk of disease being introduced into their industries from imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pork, chicken meat and salmon industries have all expressed serious concerns, which have been backed up by scientific evidence, about quarantine changes in the pipeline that threaten the present relatively disease-free status of the industries. These concerns are very real to these industries. Frightening scenarios emerge from studies done by ABARE, the government's agricultural economic research body, on the economic effects of the most serious exotic diseases in these industries being introduced into Australia. For example, should Newcastle disease occur in Australia, under present quarantine conditions, according to ABARE, the $1 billion Australian poultry and egg industries would suffer economic losses of $69 million in the first year. Consumers would lose $109 million, or $6 per person, due to higher prices. ABARE estimates that, should quarantine requirements change, imports would quickly grow to 20 per cent of domestic consumption. An outbreak of this disease would see a total loss of $93 million to producers if cooked imports were allowed. This would rise to $169 million if cooked and frozen imports were allowed in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more frightening scenarios emerge from what has already happened to some Australian industries because of the introduction of diseases and pests. Just this morning, a flower grower sent me a box of flowers that had been infected by thrips. I will table a letter from him at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago, the Australian flower industry had a rosy future with increased domestic and export markets. Today it has been devastated in certain areas by the introduction of thrips. If we now have a disease that had not previously existed, it must have come from somewhere. In two years, thrips has spread all around Australia; there is no cure for it. Australian growers have been forced to apply large doses of very strong chemicals to reduce by 50 per cent the occurrence of thrips on their flowers. This is four times the level whereby a flower can be affected and is therefore saleable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers have lost entire rows of plantings. It is moving onto chrysanthemums, baby's breath and all other species. Growers in Queensland have been excluded from Tasmanian and Victorian markets. They are reduced to selling their flowers produced from a three-month cooler period when thrips can be held under control with cooler conditions. These flower growers have invested huge sums into their flower businesses and they have become the victims of inadequate inspections of imports by AQIS and, it seems, the non-existence of import protocols for imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The damage will not stop at flowers. Thrip is a ready vehicle for the transfer of other diseases. Our vegetable industry is now threatened by the widespread occurrence of thrip. It is now only a matter of time until we have similar problems with our vegetable industry. This is exactly what happened in Hawaii where the lettuce industry was written off because of the introduction of thrip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the government quarantine policy have the right to take away the livelihoods and investments of Australian flower growers because it is sloppily imposed? Are there any protocols on the importation of flowers from countries where these diseases are known to exist? Surely examples such as the flower industry provide enough scientific evidence for a sensible quarantine policy that is scientifically justifiable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report from CEDA on APEC evaluates the effect on regional trade barriers into Asia from the perspective of Australian business. It has not only pointed out the extremely high tariffs into most Asian countries where we hope to further develop our export markets, but it also reinforces the damaging trade environment created by export enhancement subsidy programs of the United States government. For example, Australian exporters are met with average tariffs on food products of 50 per cent into Japan, 40 per cent into South Korea, 34 per cent into Malaysia, 34 per cent into Thailand, 33 per cent into the Philippines and 15 per cent into India.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With our continuing success in Asian markets with our food products, in spite of high tariffs and in spite of the US export subsidy scheme, the government needs to be reminded of the relevance of the words of the NFF when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments must enhance not squander Australia's comparative advantage in food production.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a comment that is equally true when it comes to realistically and truthfully assessing the disease risks to our Australian industries from the expansion of imports as a consequence of changed quarantine requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, an island nation, has the competitive and comparative advantage of being virtually disease free. For this reason, its primary industries are the envy of all our competitors. We must maintain these high quality health standards set over the last 90 years through our quarantine inspection service. We must maintain the advantage of clean, green, disease free products and not jeopardise it by allowing exotic diseases to be introduced through quarantine changes which are highly questioned by scientific evidence and which would clearly put it all at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent illustration of disease entering Australia through imports is the massive pilchard kill that extended from Western Australia to Noosa in Queensland in the middle of this year. I questioned the minister about its cause when it was at its peak&mdash;when he effectively said that the scientific jury was still out. However, in recent weeks the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program has made some alarming allegations. The program presented scientists who stated that there was a very strong probability that the kill was the result of disease introduced by imported pilchards. There were further allegations of vastly differing scientific opinion from those expressed in the final AQIS paper from the state agricultural departments of Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia&mdash;an opinion supported by Dr Humphrey who, since 1992, has conducted a detailed study on the importation of aquatic animals and their products for AQIS and the government. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Minister, we cannot allow the important issue of quarantine for important Australian primary industries to rest on a department losing face&mdash;there is too much at risk for everyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise several other important issues here. Firstly, the downsizing and under-resourcing of AQIS.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out by a former AQIS director, Bill Gee, `If they are downsizing AQIS resources and if state animal health resources are reducing, no governments are going about it the right way.' This was reinforced by Dr Humphrey, the consultant to AQIS, who said, `Developing industries, by their very nature, will have emerging disease problems. And to be protected from new and existing disease problems they deserve an increasing resource base to address and protect them.' If this is the considered scientific advice, why is the government cutting AQIS staff by a third when imports have increased by 40 per cent? Why is it cutting funds to the CSIRO for research? Why is this being done at a time when the government has put our economy into such a parlous state? Our export trade is our lifeline and must be able to continue to rely on our clean, green, disease free status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we have had the graphic illustration of the massive pilchard kill&mdash;the biggest fish kill ever seen in the world. We had the government's response of a task force and AQIS report&mdash;a report prompting a senior research scientist in the NSW Department of Agriculture to take the step of faxing AQIS, `The overall conclusions appear to have been sanitised for political consumption.' We have senior scientists going public to expose their enormous concern at the downplaying of the cause of the pilchard kill being the probability of disease from a virus, and an imported virus at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since June this year I have been questioning Senator Collins on the reasons for the pilchard kill&mdash;whether the Humphreys report which had been under way since 1992 had given any warnings on disease risk from imported fish or fish products;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">whether it should have alerted the government to inspect imported fish products which they did not do till mid way through this year. I have been asking why AQIS could not release the draft Humphrey report.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been pointing out indications from CSIRO scientists that an exotic virus may have been the cause. I have drawn attention to calls from CSIRO scientists of our dangerously lax quarantine standards and calls for a significant review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the time the minister, with more information at his fingertips than me, downplayed the possibility of exotic disease being the cause of the massive pilchard kill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have allegations that the AQIS report was sanitised for political consumption; that revelations of threats and dissenting opinions that an exotic pathogen could not be discounted; that AQIS has to stick to its position to not lose face; that Dr Humphreys after a three-year study for AQIS on importing fish warned of the serious threat of introducing diseases by feeding killed fish to captive marine species and that the practice should not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are most serious allegations. Many industries will be put at risk from changes in the government's quarantine policy and this is how the government is treating it. With cover ups, with defensiveness and only allowing the one side of the scientific argument to be exposed, that suits its purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that the review of our quarantine policy, as was recommended in the 1988 Lindsay report, to take place this year has not been approved by cabinet as yet.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has promised the Senate and the farmers organisations and affected industries it will take place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we were told by AQIS at a Senate committee hearing two weeks ago that the proposed review is only under consideration by the minister and that he has not taken the proposed review to cabinet as yet.

The minister has spoken of a review as a certainty, yet according to AQIS it still has not been approved by cabinet. The government should respect the genuine concerns of rural industries about any quarantine changes. The government should also heed the call of its own senior CSIRO scientists for a significant review of our quarantine policies and the lax state of present policy. As well, the government should reassure all Australians that any future quarantine changes will be based on consideration of all scientific evidence and that this whole messy business will be cleaned up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments concerning the amendments to the Wool International Act 1993 in this omnibus legislation. The four key roles of Wool International, which was set up in July 1993, were: firstly, the management of the wool stockpile; secondly, to introduce, encourage and facilitate alternative marketing methods for the selling of wool; thirdly, the privatisation of Wool International at the appropriate time; and, fourthly, the management of Wool International's non-wool assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first of these responsibilities that has created considerable criticism. Wool International's recent selling program has been a major cause of the current&mdash;and, I believe, temporary&mdash;collapse in wool prices. This present price collapse may appear to be a ho-hum event to observers of the wool industry since the absolute collapse of the wool price in 1990, but to growers, many of whom are still in the grip of drought and have had some four years of drought, this is really a very unfair and unnecessary, I believe, collapse in prices. Growers wonder why they continue to grow a fibre when they have such limited control over their destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market indicator price has presently fallen below 600c, which is a psychological level from which it is hard to build confidence. This is 200c below the June close figure of about 820c. The real key at this stage is that the market fundamental of confidence is lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool market has three elements. The first two are the growers and the buyers, and it has this sort of third man of confidence which sits out there in never-never land. When confidence disappears, the market reacts like the market for any commodity: if you want the commodity, you pay for it; if you don't want the commodity, the price collapses. You have speculation in reverse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most worrying aspects of the current market situation is the serious losses being incurred by merchants and processors due to the sudden cancellation of contracts for raw or semi-processed wool. Although China is the prominent culprit, cancellations have also been reported from India and Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A continuation of these periodic occurrences of reneging on contracts has a lasting and damaging impact on the industry. Not only does it cause financial losses, but it inhibits this third man of confidence, reduces the availability of capital, raises the cost of wool trading and discourages forward trading&mdash;a vital element of effective wool marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool market must move away from its near total reliance on the auction system. After 150 years of wool being grown in this country, we still have 85 per cent of woolgrowers accepting a spot price. It is in the interests of growers and buyers to have some form of more sophisticated risk management and risk management tools. Although risk management or contracts or forward trading frightens growers because it is something they don't understand, it is essential for the future of their industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of statements concerning the role of Wool International and its selling schedule which is required under the legislation that we are talking about. There has been pressure from exporters and brokers about reducing the amount of wool being sold. I personally don't agree with that one bit. The actual Garnaut proposals have worked extremely well in the interests of the reduction of the stockpile and the debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggested reason for the price collapse has been that China has been a reluctant buyer in the market. I believe that, regardless of the role of Wool International and the stockpile, there would still have been a correction in the price because China has basically been out of the market. The reason for that is that the central government in China has increased the tariff by 10 per cent on raw wool and imposed a 17 per cent VAT. As far as Chinese instrumentalities buying wool are concerned, it was immediately going to be 27 per cent more expensive to them. The tariff was always meant to be paid by Chinese buyers to their central government, but wasn't, and it is now being cracked down on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things is that it is not just China that is out of the market. The ABS figures on exports to our major trading wool partners in July-August show that China has been down by 28 per cent, but that Italy has been down by 26 per cent, Japan by 35 per cent, and France by 25 per cent; and overall in July-August there has been a 14.3 per cent drop over last year's exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have about 35 other markets apart from those that I have mentioned. They have had some slight increase to meet those substantial falls from our major exporting partners. In addition, the Russian wool industry has been in a position to export and has done so substantially to both China and Western Europe, an inferior quality wool. This puts into perspective the sorts of demands that are made on the Australian wool industry by our buyers about quality being the key and our buyers' requirements for high quality Australian wool. It is interesting that they have been prepared to accept Russian wool of a very inferior quality and to pay not a lot less for it. The experts suggest that the Russian wool industry is not very buoyant. The amount of their wool that has been sold will not be repeated in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International has been accused of selling forward at a discount to meet its reduction timetable. It has rejected this allegation but I guess it is semantics. It has been selling at a price at which it can make its sales. The criticism has been made that, if that is the case, how can the auction system survive against it? Wool International then took the decision to sell a weekly amount at auction. The price continued to fall, despite the fact that Wool International's reserves were at a premium at the auction price. So it was not the fault of Wool International that the price was falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately our buyers will realise that they have to start to buy and the market will start to rise. Once our buyers see that it has reached the bottom, the wool market could turn around very quickly. If we had an active forward market, growers and buyers would not have the fluctuations, the crashes, which cost them so much and make it virtually impossible for efficient management and family farmers who wish to plan for the future to see their bank managers with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of comment in the industry about how you manage this sort of crisis. I make the point about needing some forward marketing tools and I defend the role of Wool International. They have done a very good job in the two years they have been operating. There are a lot of vested interests, a lot of baggage, in the wool industry, which tends to look for scapegoats. I guess in any industry that has gone through the turmoil that the wool industry has that is probably understandable. A lot of vested interests would like to see Wool International removed from the marketplace. Very often with brokers and buyers&mdash;especially brokers&mdash;trying to explain to an irate grower why the price fluctuates so much it is easy to find a bogeyman in Wool International. We have had criticism that Wool International should operate behind closed doors, that we should not know what they are doing in the marketplace. On the other hand that their operation in the marketplace should be completely transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to end on a confident note. In times like these woolgrowers feel depressed and worried about their future. But apart from what I have mentioned there are several reasons why wool textiles are poised to achieve a modest turnaround in the next two or three months. There are instances of retail optimism in our traditional markets. Consumption is already at a low base. Retailers are not heavily stocked and are in a better position to respond positively if the world economy has even a modest recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the medium to long-term wool pipeline, of about 18 months, is certainly not overburdened with wool and that any price movement or any restoration of confidence will require this pipeline to be fed. Contrary to some reports, in the textile pipeline there are generally acceptable levels. There are exceptions such as greasy wool and worsted yarn in Japan and wool top in France. Most orders are being met from production, not stocks. The wool is being used as it comes out of the factory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The downward adjustment of prices that we have seen in 1995, particularly in fine wools, and the continuing relatively high price of synthetic fibres have caused a significant reduction in the wool-synthetic price ratio. I am told that there has been some substitution back to wool in the fibre choice stakes already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overhanging wool textile demand for 1996 is the stark reality of a further reduction in the global availability of wool as wool production continues to decline in virtually all wool exporting countries. That is certainly the case in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is very hard to get a real handle on the fall in any wool production, all the experts suggest there will be at least a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in new wool coming onto the Australian market in 1995-96. To put that into perspective, that is about 600 million kilos. Australia has sold, over the last five years, about 850 million kilos if you add what came out of the stockpile, which was about 150 million kilos. It means that this year we will place in the market well below the amount of wool we have traditionally&mdash;traditionally over the last five years&mdash;sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that even a modest recovery in demand for wool is likely to exceed available supplies at current prices. The crucial missing factor is market confidence. Once that is restored textile activity will lift and prices will begin to rise, led initially by fine wool which will be most affected by the reduced availability in 1996, especially if the drought continues to break and the fibre diameter starts to broaden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Demand from China clearly continues to be the key to recovery, but it is not the only key. I believe that when the trigger comes&mdash;in the first instance, it will probably come from Europe&mdash;there will be a sustained recovery, and China will re-enter the market and again play a very important part as our major or near major wool buyer in 1996-97. </PARA>

You would allow no mail into the country. You would allow no-one to leave or enter the country. You would allow no food exports from this country or no food imports into this country. If that is what Senator Boswell and the National Party are advocating, you would reach a ridiculous position with quarantine policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is amusing about Senator Boswell's approach, if it was not so serious, for example, is that he says we should not allow pork imports into Australia on the basis of quarantine risk. There may or may not be valid arguments for that but we continually look ridiculous in the eyes of the international community because the pork industry says, `Let wheat imports in because we need the wheat to feed the pigs,' but some sectors of the wheat industry come along and say, `Don't let the wheat in because of the quarantine risk.' So the pork industry is saying, `Don't let the Canadian pork in but let the wheat in'&mdash;which the wheat industry argues is a quarantine risk&mdash;`so we can feed our pigs.' So Senator Boswell has given us a totally contradictory position on that sort of issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the legislation before us is not central to quarantine policy.

If other countries applied the sorts of principles Senator Boswell wants to practice with imports, other countries would do exactly the same and we would export absolutely nothing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in this matter of public interest debate I wish to address the matter of the administration in the office and department of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). The minister has in recent times received many accolades for the taxpayer funded `Australia Remembers' campaign. This campaign is undoubtedly worth while although some would argue somewhat politicised by Mr Sciacca.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has presented himself to the people of Australia, and indeed the world, as the smiling, `butter would not melt in my mouth' fellow. Loves shaking hands does our minister, especially when handing out taxpayers' money. The more pomp and ceremony associated with the handing out of taxpayers' money the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behind this smiling facade is a man who all of a sudden becomes media shy and runs from the glare of the lights when the focus is placed on his administrative capacities or otherwise and the costs to the taxpayers that flow as a consequence. In recent times we had a feature article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> exposing the lack of ministerial direction at the Australian War Memorial. Allegations of workplace harassment have plagued the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When problems associated with the Merit Protection Review Agency inquiry were raised with Mr Sciacca he said that he took a deliberate decision not to intervene. A Federal Court judgment cleared the names of those against whom allegations had been made. But it also raised questions about the performance of two federal ministers&mdash;Mr Johns and Mr Sciacca. To quote Michael Gordon, political editor with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more poignant section of the judgment asks just why there was no action by those in positions of power and responsibility to respond to the concerns of Kelson and McKernan without the matter having to be settled in the Courts.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister's excuse&mdash;I took a very deliberate decision not to intervene. The non-intervention cost the taxpayers of this country thousands of dollars. While the minister was busy glad handing people and spreading cheques like confetti he was, according to him, deliberately not involving himself in the administrative problems of his department. I say to the minister: if you want the salary, the limousine, the VIP jet, the taxpayers' money to hand out, then do what you are duty bound to do&mdash;that is, administer your department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The War Memorial fiasco is not the only example. Some three or so months ago I raised the issue of the dismissal of Ms Fiona Hitchen from the office of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. As a result of my expression of interest in the matter, I have been provided with further and more detailed information which gives me great cause for concern about administration within the minister's office. It is noteworthy that Labor's new unfair dismissal legislation applies to members of parliamentary staff. It is just so typical that the first member of parliament to fall foul of this legislation should be a Labor minister. Labor is always so strong on the rhetoric but always so very different in practice. It is no wonder the blue-collar voter is deserting Labor and the trade union movement. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right, Senator Patterson. I understand that Ms Hitchen commenced her political involvement as a professional assistant to Senator Gareth Evans in 1990. From there she moved to personal secretary to the federal secretary of the ALP, then to Minister Collins's office and then to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs' office. So she had a track record of some five years of being involved with the Labor Party, their ministers and their organisational structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I am reliably informed that on occasions ministers such as Graham Richardson and Robert Ray involved themselves to assist in finding her placements. Hardly the actions one would anticipate from such hard-playing and callous ministers as Richardson and Ray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 Ms Hitchen became the personal secretary to Con Sciacca. On the first day of December 1994, she was dismissed in breach of Labor's new unfair dismissal legislation. Ms Hitchen, whilst taking a one week break, was told over the telephone not to bother coming back to work and to clear her desk out on a Sunday so as not to cause any `difficulty' in the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the minister's office had pre-planned to tell this lady she would be dismissed whilst she was on holidays. As I understand it, while she was on holidays she rang into the office every day to make sure everything was okay. And on the fourth day she is advised, `Don't bother coming back. And when you empty out your desk, make sure it's on a Sunday so nobody else in the office has the opportunity to talk to you.' That is the sort of industrial relations that the Australian Labor Party in office practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who advised Ms Hitchen of her dismissal was Greg Rudd the senior adviser in the minister's office. It is interesting to note that he is the brother of Kevin Rudd, a federal Labor candidate in Queensland. It is all within the family up there in Queensland!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In typical Labor Party style, in dismissing Ms Hitchen without any reasons as to why or counselling or disciplining her in any way&mdash;if that was warranted&mdash;she was provided a job in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It was promised to her on a permanent basis but then, in fact, it only became a three-month contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reason to believe that the contract was signed on 5 December 1994, some four days after she was told that she was dismissed from the minister's office. If she was not good enough for the minister's office, why on earth was she good enough for the department? The normal departmental processes were not gone through and, in fact, it occasioned great upset within the department that somebody from outside should be appointed to a special project without proper consultation with the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For such a person as Ms Hitchen, who undoubtedly considered that she had a career with the Australian Labor Party, such shabby treatment must have come as a deep shock. Indeed, Ms Hitchen suffered severe stress resulting from this matter and had to be taken to hospital after collapsing in front of her young son. She was admitted to a local ACT hospital on 6 December, 1994, as a result of stress-related difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bit of history. In September, 1994, Ms Hitchen accompanied the minister as his adviser to the federal conference of the Australian Labor Party in my home town of Hobart instead of Mr Greg Rudd, the senior adviser. The reason being that it was adjudged by the minister that Mr Rudd was so politically "on the nose" that it would be better for him to be accompanied by Ms Hitchen. I understand that this may well have occasioned some of the friction within the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Hitchen's initial appointment to Mr Sciacca's office was as a result of the intervention of Senator Robert Ray&mdash;intervention to which Mr Greg Rudd appears to have taken great exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Ms Hitchen developed a relationship with an ALP backbencher in the House of Representatives which, to the paranoid Right of Queensland, occasioned the minister with some fanciful concerns and further paranoia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, this matter appeared before the Industrial Relations Commission on 23 February 1995. Ms Hitchen took the matter to court for unfair dismissal. The matter settled. The terms of settlement have never been disclosed. But I am reliably informed that, after the initial presentation of Ms Hitchen's case to the commission, those allegedly representing the minister did not contest in any shape or form that Ms Hitchen was unfairly dismissed. Therefore, the only question that had to be determined was the question of costs, the question of damages and the actual terms of the settlement. I am reliably informed that, after hours of negotiations, a substantial payment was made to Ms Hitchen and a letter of apology was written by Mr Rudd to Ms Hitchen. We did not see the smiling minister alert the press for another cheque handover ceremony on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this outcome, Ms Hitchen was then subjected to death threats via the telephone. Those death threats made mention of her recent settlement in the commission. In loyalty to her party, she did not make any complaint until the threats implicated her young son. She then had no other choice, like any mother, but to inform the Australian Federal Police. The results of their investigation, or who made these calls, is not known to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of raising this matter once again is not to remind Ms Hitchen of this tragedy. It is designed, however, to highlight the duplicity in which Labor undertakes employment of its own people; yet preaches a version of social justice for employers, which they themselves once they are employers are unable to match. It highlights the duplicity of Labor's approach to industrial relations. Above all, it highlights yet again the minister's incapacity to do his job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Further, Mr Rudd and the minister appear to have got away with occasioning substantial costs on the taxpayers of Australia: firstly, by having to pay compensation to Ms Hitchen; and, secondly, by having legal representation for the Department of Administrative Services at the industrial commission, which I am reliably informed included a Queen's Counsel from Melbourne, the cost of which was at least $1,969. The costs of all this ought be visited upon Mr Greg Rudd and the minister. The minister ought be made responsible to this parliament and to the people of Australia as to why they are so incompetent in running their office on an administratively fair basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders whether Mr Rudd has been disciplined; whether he has been counselled; and whether he has, in fact, been demoted for his behaviour. If not, the people of Australia quite clearly have a right to ask&mdash;why not? I ask rhetorically what the government has done in relation to Mr Rudd and the minister. Whilst the minister and his office bask in all the glory of the taxpayer funded `Australia Remembers' program, they ought be made to account for the unnecessary costs to the taxpayer and for the personal humiliation, loss of self-esteem and hurt occasioned to the people at the Australian War Memorial and Ms Hitchen. I am sure that Ms Hitchen "remembers"; I am sure that the employees at the Australian War Memorial "remember"; and we on this side will make sure that `Australia remembers'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on an issue that is of importance to me. It was an issue that was highlighted last week during National Carers Week, which was held from 8 to 14 October. This is the first opportunity I have had of talking about carers since that week occurred. Caring is emerging as one of the important social policy issues of the 1990s and will continue to increase in importance as we see an ever increasing number of older people in Australia. There are 1.5 million Australians who have a responsibility for someone who is frail, elderly or who has a chronic illness or a disability. There are about 540 Australians for whom this responsibility is a full-time job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost all of us will at some time in our lives be a carer or need to be cared for. The enormous extent of the contribution of carers is evidenced by the fact that 74 per cent of the service needs of people who have a disability or who are ill or frail are provided for by carers; that is, nearly three-quarters of the caring that is done is provided by carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire home and community care program&mdash;the HACC program&mdash;meets only nine per cent of that need, with a budget of $657 million in 1994-95. Extrapolating from those figures, the New South Wales Carers Association estimate that carers contribute about $7.3 billion worth of services per year. That may or may not be exactly right but it is within the ballpark of the sort of level of effort that goes into caring for those who are not able to care for themselves. Caring is becoming an important social issue not just because of the huge numbers involved but because families are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the care gap between needs and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is plenty of rhetoric from the government but only token recognition in terms of tangible support of the contribution made by carers. To be fair, the government has introduced some important programs for carers, but both the House of Representatives inquiry into HACC and the Commonwealth-state efficiency and effectiveness review of HACC concluded that there is a significant undersupply of services to carers and the people they support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two issues I would like to mention regarding the issue of carers: the issue of women and caring and the issue of the needs of carers. I raise the issue of women and caring because carers are overwhelmingly women. It is a fact that almost every woman&mdash;not every woman but a large majority of women&mdash;will at some stage either be a carer or will need care at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women make up 60 per cent of the carers and the ABS survey of Australian families found that, of these, 50 per cent are in the work force and 72 per cent are under the age of 54. So a large number of these carers are juggling the caring role, work and, most probably, caring for children. Some academics in the business talk about the sandwich generation&mdash;the women who still have dependent children and are also looking after dependent relatives, either older relatives or frail or disabled younger people. It is usually the women in the middle who provide the care, and they are often co-resident with the person for whom they provide care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent years there has been a growing recognition of women as the primary carers of children. At the same time, there has been increasing concern about the significant number of women caring for elderly parents, permanently or temporarily disabled family members or frail aged partners at home. This second group is a largely hidden group of carers who unquestioningly assume carer roles as and when their families need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the role of women as carers not only because they do by far the greatest amount of the caring in our community but because, as one of the pop singers of my youth&mdash;I cannot remember who it was&mdash;said, `The times they are a-changing.' These changes will drastically affect the availability of carers into the future. You only have to look at a couple of the significant demographic social and economic changes that are taking place. Families are changing; they are smaller and they are more mobile. Because families have fewer children there will not be as many family members to share the caring as there have been in past generations. As we see highly mobile families, we see that more often than not they do not live in the same town as the people who need care. Even when they are in the same city, the family has work and other family commitments that reduce and limit the amount of time available for caring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that is causing changes is the increased number of family break downs. Divorce and remarriage has meant changed responsibilities and commitments: one part of the family may have a commitment to the mother but not to the stepfather, or to the stepfather and not to the mother. I have been reminded that it was Bob Dylan who said `the times they are a-changing'. The times are a-changing and reconstructed families&mdash;new families and remarriages&mdash;mean that there are changes in the sense of responsibility for older people in the family. I believe that will reduce the number of carers who are available and who have a sense of responsibility for the care of older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor which reduces the hours or the people available for caring is the participation of women in the work force. It is uncertain whether women in the future will be automatically available to undertake the level of care that is presently available in the community. What has not changed is the workplace, and carers, who are employed, find it difficult, if not impossible, to combine work and caring responsibilities. As I said, a large number of female carers are in the paid work force and there is not, as yet, mainstream recognition for other family responsibilities such as care for the elderly in the workplace. The choice for many is not work and caring but work or caring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I set up, in conjunction with two of my colleagues, the first diploma of gerontology at Lincoln Institute. We geared it to train people who are not necessarily primary health givers but who may be associated with gerontology and the ageing. We envisaged that we would attract architects, town-planners and interior designers, and we did do that. I visited a very large firm in Victoria. They had appointed one of the graduates of that course. She was an occupational health and safety nurse. When I discovered her there, I was surprised, delighted and thrilled to see one of the products of a course that I had been involved in instigating. The reason they had employed her as an occupational health and safety nurse was that she could combine that skill and her knowledge in gerontology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they had done a survey of the employees in that company, the issue that came up over and over again that was affecting productivity was the strain and the demands that were being placed on the workers in terms of caring for older people in their families. They appointed that nurse because she could work with the employees and tell them how to access services and tell them about the modifications to make to their homes so it would be easier for the employees to keep their older relatives at home et cetera. I thought it was a very enlightened approach that this large company was addressing the issue of dealing with older people that its workers were facing. Unfortunately, that is an exception rather than the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people assume that, even if working women are not available to care, the young old will care for the old old, and that is not necessarily the case. There has also been a move away from institutional care to increased emphasis on community care. Irrespective of what happens, that places enormous loads on families. We would all agree that people should have the choice as to whether they should be in institutional care or whether they should be at home and, of course, that does add another burden and another aspect to  care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I raise today in this discussion is the issue of the needs of carers. Carers are a forgotten group of people: a veritable army of thousands and thousands of Australians who are bearing enormous economic, social and health costs in terms of earnings forgone, financial stress, social isolation and deterioration of physical and psychological health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are caring for someone with dementia it is not very easy to take them out when they behave in socially unacceptable ways and when they are, perhaps, incontinent. It is very difficult for the carer to take someone with dementia out with them because the person can become agitated and disoriented and so the carer stays home and becomes more and more isolated. I visit nursing homes and hostels, and staff in one after the other tell me that often the reason the person is in the hostel or the nursing home is because the carer's health has broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many carers suffer poverty and economic disadvantage because they cannot work. When I was out in one of the regional centres of Victoria, there was a case where a man aged 58 told me about his 53-year-old wife who has full-blown Alzheimer's disease. The husband was locking his wife up at home when he went to work because otherwise she would have got out. He found that this was not a viable option, but there was nothing for him to do until he found that one of the local hostels had a bit of what I call `slop in the system'. There is no Commonwealth funding for this sort of thing because our programs are so inflexible, but the hostel had been bequested some money and the management was able to offer to take the man's wife into the hostel during the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The man was able to pick his wife up in the evening when he came home from work and he was also able to pick her up late two evenings a week so that he could play snooker and have dinner with some of his friends. The man was, therefore, able to remain an employee and to have an income. He was able to be a taxpayer in the community and be seen to be caring for his wife and yet he was able to have some respite. It was a wonderful option for him in the very difficult situation of his wife having early dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people in this situation and so often our programs are designed so that we have to try to fit the client to the program rather than fit the program to the client. This is a case where funding is not flexible enough to accommodate this sort of problem and where somebody who is not as lucky as this gentleman would end up at an economic disadvantage. As I said, there are health costs for the carers and there are the additional costs of their having to modify their houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major cost is transport. I recently spent some time in rural New South Wales visiting nursing homes and hostels and looking at community programs. Comments are made to me over and over again about transport: how do people get to hospitals? How do people get their relatives to the doctor if they cannot drive a car? There is a real problem in terms of carers being able to transport the people for whom they care to various facilities. The other thing that happens with carers&mdash;especially younger ones in the work force&mdash;is that they have to move out of the work force to care for an older relative. Carers, especially women, have broken work patterns and their superannuation contributions are affected. The federal government has not adequately addressed this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many issues, particularly for rural carers and for carers from non-English-speaking backgrounds; I could go on and on. Carers are a group of people which is under recognised and whose needs are neglected. Another thing that concerns me is that the Commonwealth government took over the organisation of the publicity for `Carers week' whereas previously it was organised by the carers association. I have some suspicions about why it was taken away from the carers association. For the government to take over a role that a voluntary organisation has been undertaking and to put its own stamp on it is a dangerous precedent to set. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the last break I had the opportunity with my colleague Senator John Herron to travel through western Queensland. We travelled in an area where neither I nor other politicians often have the opportunity to go. The areas we travelled through encompassed about 18 communities in the south-west, west, north-west and north of Queensland and we travelled a total of 4,000 kilometres by road over a period of seven days. It was a great opportunity for myself and for Senator Herron to speak to people on the ground in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theme of our expedition was `Listening to people in western Queensland' and it was a tremendous opportunity to do just that. I would certainly recommend to other parliamentarians, if they have the time and the opportunity, to go and experience how these smaller communities in western Queensland exist. I want to spend just a couple of minutes today to run through some of the things that we saw and did and some of the issues that were raised with us in the course of that particular trip. My colleague Senator Herron is following me in this debate and he will also mention some of the things that happened, but he will be concentrating on health aspects of those smaller communities in western Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those areas are well represented in the federal parliament by my colleague Mr Bruce Scott, the member for Maranoa, and Mr Bob Katter, the member for Kennedy, but it was important that I, as a senior member of the coalition's shadow ministry, and Senator Herron, with his involvement in policy making as part of the coalition's policy review committee and as the parliamentary secretary ot the shadow minister for health, got out and had a look at the issues out there so that we could incorporate the things that we learned in coalition policy as it is prepared for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We started the trip on Monday morning at the Cobb and Co. museum in Toowoomba. That is a tremendous facility in itself. It is a repository for all the coaches and horse drawn vehicles of yesteryear and demonstrates the ways that people used to work and get around in the early days. It was interesting that, as the curator of the museum pointed out to us, the trip we were doing was taking us seven days to do the 4,000 kilometres; if we had been going in a Cobb and Co. coach, as they did in the old days, it would have taken 50 days. That shows that, in spite of the poor standard of most of the roads out that way, we still are a lot better off than we used to be in the horse and buggy days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Toowoomba we went to Goondiwindi and spoke with people there about the cotton industry and about the need for water storage and the difficulties caused by the drought in that south-western community on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. During our stay in Goondiwindi we walked the main street. I had the opportunity of talking to people in a welfare shop&mdash;the opportunity shop run by the Anglican Church&mdash;and having a discussion with them. They said to us that it is very clear that their business, unfortunately, has increased in recent months as the drought has impacted more heavily on those areas of south-western Queensland. It is a tragedy. But it is tremendous to see people like the Opportunity Shop and the St Vincent De Paul playing a real role in looking after the less fortunate in those western communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also spoke with a business facilitator who was doing work for the Queensland and Commonwealth governments. He has given me some very good points to take up in parliament, as I will, and I will be writing to the minister. But he points out&mdash;Senator Sherry might be interested in this&mdash;that some of the Commonwealth programs, whilst they sound good on paper, just do not work because it is too difficult for business people in the communities that are affected by drought to qualify under the government's regulations. The red tape, the regulation that is needed to be gone through, is just debilitating and very few people end up qualifying although they desperately need help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Goondiwindi we went on to St George and spoke with a local medical practitioner there, Dr Stone, who is also a councillor on the Balonne Shire Council. We met the Mayor of the Balonne shire at St George. We had a useful discussion with them about the problems facing those particular communities. From St George we travelled on to Cunnamulla, one of the furthest west of the towns in south-west Queensland; we got there quite late and had our meeting the next morning. I spoke to the council and Senator Herron went round to the hospital. We also spoke to other community people, other townspeople in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that came out of my meeting was that, whilst the Commonwealth government is working flat out to get all these REDOs&mdash;regional economic development organisations&mdash;set up before the federal election, people in these western towns see them for the political campaign they are. They appreciate that these REDOs really are a lot of hype; there is a lot of talk about them and a lot of ribbon cutting, but not much money in it. As to the community of interest, these far western communities are being forced into an association with, would you believe, Toowoomba&mdash;many hours to the east. That really demonstrated to me what I had always suspected, that a lot of these REDO proposals are just set-ups by the Labor Party for electioneering purposes. They are not well put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Cunnamulla we went into Charleville and again spoke with the townspeople and health professionals, and got a feeling of what was happening in that major western town. From Charleville we headed north to Blackall and again had a joint meeting of councillors and community people. We learnt about the problems they are experiencing, and about the kangaroo industry and what an important industry it is to that particular community of Blackall. That we found very interesting. We also looked there at how people in small western communities can access the best in communications&mdash;if not quite using the superhighway, certainly by way of computer and modem they were able to access a lot of educational facilities. The council and a group set up under the council were actually working, while we were there, teaching people with the aid of computers connected to educational resources in the east. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then went on to Barcaldine. We spoke with local people in Barcaldine and had our obligatory photo taken under the tree of knowledge, where the old Labor Party was originally formed. It was a party bearing little resemblance to the lot of chardonnay socialists you have today&mdash;the chattering classes that run the Labor Party&mdash;and it was good to see where the old-style Labor Party was said to be initiated under the tree of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Barcaldine we went into Longreach, a major town in western Queensland and one that is doing very well from its emphasis on outback tourism. The Stockman's Hall of Fame is very well patronised, it has been very well put together and is one facility which all Australians should at some time in their life go and experience. We met with the medical people there and were told of the problems confronting people in the health area. Senator Herron will speak about that later. I also spoke with the mayor in Longreach, Councillor Joan Moloney, who explained to me some of the difficulties that they were experiencing. It is a progressive town and a town that has optimism, and they will certainly be making the best of what they can do. I was also able to speak with the long established Regional Development and Planning Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Longreach we went on to Winton, stopping at the hospital there and speaking with the local doctor, and then from Winton we went west for a four-hour trip, seeing practically no other cars and very few houses or people. It is really heading out towards the Simpson Desert. There is a little town halfway called Middleton, where there is a very old and rather quaint hotel sitting completely in the middle of nowhere. We stopped there and had a couple of beers with the locals who happened to be in there. You get a feel in those places of just what it is like for people who spend all of their time in that isolation&mdash;far from neighbours, far from the services that people in the east and in the capital cities treat as just common, everyday facilities. For these people, really, their only facility is the hotel and their nearest neighbour is, in many instances, an hour away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Hamilton we went to Boulia, and spoke with the local council there about some of the problems impacting on people in that area. They have problems with their mail service; it is very irregular and it sometimes takes five days to get first class mail in. They do not have mains electricity&mdash;something that we all take for granted in the east&mdash;but they were prepared to contribute $80,000 each to get the mains electricity to their property. However, that was rejected because the government wanted them to subsidise the main from Mount Isa to Boulia. These are the sorts of things that people living in those areas put up with. A better TV service was something that they desperately wanted. They have two channels but with a bit of help from government they could access the cricket and the football from another source and that was something that should be easily available and would make a big difference to life in the west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From there we went to Mount Isa and spoke with many people in that community. The fly-in fly-out of the mining operations is the big issue in Mount Isa at the moment. From Mt Isa we went to Cloncurry, the town where both my mother and father were born in the first decade of this century. In Cloncurry, I spoke with councils and, again, Senator Herron and I went up to the hospital and spoke with professionals there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We left Cloncurry and headed further north to the Burke and Wills Roadhouse and met some interesting people there, including the chairman of the Burke Shire Council. We then went on to Normanton and finally to Karumba, where we arrived at 10 p.m. to a blackout. The white ants had eaten the insides of an electricity pole holding the main transformer in Karumba but no-one had noticed the damage because the outside of the pole looked good. On the day that we arrived the transformer fell and the whole town was blacked out. But it did not deter us. We got to bed that night and then early the next morning spoke with locals about the proposal to dredge the port at Karumba to facilitate live cattle export through Karumba. We also learned about the proposal for Century Zinc to pipe out zinc slurry from the mine site to Karumba. The slurry will be de-watered there and then taken out by marine transport to its ultimate destination. That is quite an exciting project and one that will mean a lot to the north-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then travelled to Normanton and spoke with the Carpenteria Council there and the hospital about matters of importance to them. From Normanton, we went east to Croydon and met the council there. We then went on through Georgetown to Forsayth. We spent the night in Forsayth with the publican, who is also the mayor, John Smith and his wife Grace. We learnt a great deal from our very interesting evening at the bar with the mayor and the locals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day we left early and travelled through Einasleigh past Innot Hot Springs to Herberton and then to Ravenshoe where they were in the middle of their annual festival. Ravenshoe is a community with whom I have had a long association. Senators might remember that this is the community that the Labor Party practically shut down several years ago because of its insensitivity in dealing with World Heritage listing. If you want a good fight in Ravenshoe you just have to say `Graham Richardson is a good fellow.' From there, we went to Atherton where we talked with a very significant medical practitioner there, a Dr Green, who is renowned around Australia&mdash;I am sure Senator Herron will speak more on this&mdash;and finally on to Cairns to ocnclude our 4,000 kilometre trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trip was tremendously beneficial for me as it helped me to understand what is happening in those smaller western and remote communities. It was interesting to see that in the south-west there is a concern about the future, about the population drift from the inland&mdash;people are uncertain where they will be in 10 years or 15 years time. In the north-west by contrast there seemed to be a lot more optimism on the back of new mining ventures and frontier tourism. The trip was particularly beneficial and it is one that I recommend to all senators. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that struck me as we went along is that, if anybody has cause for complaint, it is these people. They went through the worst recession in 60 years as a result of this government and this situation is compounded by the worst drought that they have ever had. You will read in the papers about how the drought appears to have broken, but I can assure you that it hasn't broken. It is still a major problem, particularly for the people of western and central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing that has affected these people is the Goss Labor government. The Goss government withdrew economic rationality in that it started closing railway stations down and services followed. Post offices have also been closed down. It is interesting that the biggest centre in Cloncurry is the Commonwealth Employment Service; it is the main government industry there. The other thing that has occurred, of course, because of the failure in services is the dramatic drift of population from these western centres. The combination of the recession, the drought and the closure of services means that people have shifted to the coast. This in turn has meant that a lot of the social services have diminished in these towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would think that large provincial cities like Toowoomba&mdash;where population has actually increased&mdash;would not be affected. But, just a couple of days after we set out, there was a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Toowoomba Chronicle</EMPHASIS> from Dr John Hede who is the President of the Visiting Specialists Association, Toowoomba General Hospital. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are more than 1,000 people on the waiting lists,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and most will not be pleased to be compared to those "buying airline tickets". (TC 27/9/95).</PARA>
<PARA>He quotes from the regional director there. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least an airline usually accommodates an excess of numbers by putting on extra flights. A waiting list should be dynamic&mdash;within a reasonable time, an individual's turn should come around. For many at Toowoomba General, their turn never comes. The present waiting list is the worst it has been for 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA>If this is not an indictment of the federal government, nothing is. The Toowoomba General Hospital is dependent on the funding that comes from the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is just the precursor of what I saw as we visited health groups in all these country towns. The biggest complaint, interestingly enough, is the shortage of doctors, but that should not surprise you. The interesting aspect of this situation is that the major cause of the situation is the Hawke Labor government's abolition of tax deductibility for educational expenses. Once upon a time doctors could stay in a country town and, when their children needed secondary education, the children would go to boarding school on the coast. Once that was abolished, of course, the doctors shifted with their families for the sake of their children's education and this has had a dramatic effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing which has had an effect and which has not been spoken about is the feminisation of medical practice. More than half the number of medical students now are female and, inevitably, they get married. They usually marry non-medical people and they stay in the cities. In bulk-billing clinics female doctors can earn an income and raise their families at the same time, and this, in turn, has had a compounding effect. There is a dramatic shortage of doctors in the county areas because half the graduates are now female and they marry and stay in the cities. Female doctors do not want to go to the country, understandably, because of their family situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of the shift of doctors from rural areas is the fact that they cannot get locums to relieve them either for holidays or to enable them to get postgraduate education. These days, doctors are reaccredited on an annual basis. To get reaccreditation a doctor has to attend postgraduate training exercises, but they cannot get away. The government&mdash;in its wisdom&mdash;by looking after the citizens of Sydney and Melbourne in particular, has put in a rebate system where, if the doctors are not accredited, patients get a lower rebate from Medicare. It is economically unsound for doctors to stay in these areas. There are a number of fine doctors in rural areas, but the constant complaint is, `We need a break.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor in Cloncurry had been there for six months and, when I was there, he was getting his first week off in six months. He was on call 24 hours per day, seven days a week for six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a dramatic shortage of nurses in these country areas, for similar reasons: they are expected to work beyond the call of duty; they are expected to be on call at nights and during weekends. Although a lot of the facilities are good, they cannot get relief. The college based education for nurses, as opposed to being hospital based, has meant that they are now university graduates from four-year training courses. These graduates do not want to go to rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is compounded in Queensland because there has been a dramatic increase in population. My friend Senator Warwick Parer appropriately spoke about the town of Warwick. He said that, when he was a child, the population of Warwick was 10,000 and the population of Australia was six million. It is now 8,000 in Warwick and 18 million in Australia. As a Queenslander, I look forward to the year 2020 when the population of Queensland will outstrip Victoria's. I am delighted that Queensland will not have that monkey on its back any longer. Queensland will no longer be regarded as a less populous and therefore less important state. In 2020, we will become the second most important and most populous state in Australia. But that, perhaps, is beyond my time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will recall, Senator Sherry, that Tasmania was so highly thought of during the Commonwealth Games that it was left off the map. I am sure that was regretted at the time. It is interesting to go through the population of the towns that we visited. For example, when I first went to Mount Isa, it had a population of 30,000. Five years ago, it was 25,000; it is now 18,000. Mount Isa is the largest city in Queensland, outside the provincial cities and the capital, and this is something that people do not consider. It has a large population and many changes have occurred. In fact, whilst we were there, we saw a deputation that was interested in stimulating small business to try to retain the population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our trip, it came home to me that not only was there a shortage of nurses and doctors but also there was a shortage of pharmacists and dentists. As we are being broadcast, if there are any dentists, pharmacists or doctors who have reached retiring age, who would like to help the rural communities, I assure them that there is plenty of opportunity for doing locums in Queensland country towns. They would be welcomed with open arms, and the facilities are there. I came across a dentist who was spending his time helping the people in the west. It is particularly the case in that occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pharmacists are in similar straits. I met a number of pharmacists who were considering moving to the city because of the draconian control that now exists over pharmacies. Due to the pharmaceutical benefit scheme, they cannot get extra remuneration from anything other than the dispensation of pharmaceuticals under the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought, the recession and the lack of amenities and facilities become a vicious circle. This compounds, and nurses, doctors, pharmacists and dentists leave the country towns. Because of the lack of available facilities, these people shift to larger centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I learnt from this trip is the wonderful character and the almost pioneering spirit that still exists among the people that we met. Not one complained about their lot. I will not mention the town, but I was a little amused at the time that its shire clerk said that he could not understand why people wouldn't shift from the cities. He said, `We've got some of the cheapest land available.' When we questioned him, he said the land cost $600 for a home site. He said, `We have the best climate in Australia.' When I questioned him about the climate, he said, `The top temperature here during summer is 40 degrees, and that is not unreasonable.' I questioned him about water&mdash;of course, bore water is available there&mdash;and in all sincerity he could not understand why people were clustering on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are demographic changes, of course, that will not attract people but, quite rightly, the complaint also is that the wealth of the country comes from these areas. This is particularly so in Queensland with its mining areas. There is also the tremendous mining development that Senator Ian Macdonald referred to&mdash;the largest goldmine in Australia at Kidston, just north of Forsayth. And, of course, there is Mount Isa itself, which is a huge producer of overseas earning for this country. There are also the coalfields. Some of the largest open-cut coalfields in the world are situated on the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the delights of going through this area&mdash;out to Boulia, out to Mount Isa, through to Karumba in the Gulf and across through the centre of the base of the Cape&mdash;is to recognise the tourism potential of the area. I have travelled the circumference of Australia and, as I say, it is the first time that Senator Macdonald and I have driven to Boulia, but I thoroughly recommend the hospitality and the facilities that are available. The roads are good, too. We had to dodge a few kangaroos and cattle across the roads in the middle of the night&mdash;particularly when Senator Macdonald was driving&mdash;but I will not mention anything else as he might not take me with him next time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people we struck have wonderful personalities and there is a spirit of sacrifice by the people who stay there and who provide the social services: the nurses, doctors, pharmacists, and the dentists on whom I particularly concentrated. Senator Macdonald and I learnt a lot from these people about the requirements that they have. I must say that we did not strike one Labor voter in any of the pubs. I have a lovely memory of a fellow I thought might have been misguided enough to vote for the Labor Party. I asked him what he did for a living and he said that he chased a few cows around the place. Even he repeated the statement that I made at the beginning about getting rid of that XYZ; that unmentionable person in Canberra. All of us would agree with that&mdash;on this side of the chamber, at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that was said to me&mdash;I got it from everybody I met&mdash;is that it is time to change. The message that I got from everybody is, `Let's change.' After 13 years of Labor, the worst recession in 60 years&mdash;the one we had to have&mdash;the unemployment that exists in the country and the lack of hope that we struck with the present government in power, the constant mantra that we got from everybody we struck&mdash;everybody without exception&mdash;was, `Let's change.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity today in the matters of public interest debate to report to the Senate on the result of the 94th Inter-Parliamentary Conference which was held in Bucharest last week. I was one of the Australian delegates, along with the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), Senator Woods and Senator Denman. Unfortunately, Senator Woods had to return home because, I believe, of food poisoning of some description. It is quite understandable in that particular part of the world. At various stages we all succumbed to food poisoning and whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four major topics were discussed at the conference and three of the topics were set down at the last conference. One topic in particular&mdash;in which Senator Denman played quite a leading role&mdash;is from the conference in Copenhagen and it concerned strategies for the effective implementation of the resolution of the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia made the point that the international forum and the World Summit for Social Development are the starting point of a long process. It is up to each and every country to be single-minded in working towards achieving outcomes that contribute to the alleviation of poverty, the reduction of unemployment and the enhancement of social integration. That was the point of view being put by the Australian group. Obviously, that Australian group, including myself, would recognise that poverty and unemployment exist in our own country. We were not being critical of other countries. We were just pointing out that that particular conference in Copenhagen last year made those points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This very important matter was discussed by the third committee at this conference. Senator Denman was on that drafting committee. After three very long and arduous days they came out with a statement which will be presented to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important topic that was covered was the matter of corruption and I spoke on that saying that parliamentary action defied corruption and I spoke on the need for international cooperation in that field. I pointed out to the conference the system that we have here, the Senate committee system and the scrutiny to which we subject the government and government departments. From my understanding of speakers from other countries, we seem to have a system as good as, if not better than, any other. We have a better system of being able to scrutinise wastage and possible corruption within our community. I made the point that, if we cannot keep our politicians and parliaments corruption free, then it is very difficult to make the rest of the community corruption free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, you cannot say the same in other countries. We heard plenty of examples of corruption within parliaments and by public servants, particularly in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of very good recommendations were put forward and a very complicated draft was adopted. It is hoped that that will help, particularly developing countries, to develop within their parliamentary systems ways and means of scrutinising their parliamentary operations and their dealings with public money through such things as ombudsmen, whistleblower protection and all those other things that we take for granted but which do not exist in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplementary item was something that particularly Australia and our neighbour New Zealand can be rightly proud of. We fought very hard. The supplementary item was voted upon by the members of the conference which consisted of over 130 countries, with some 1,000 people in attendance. To get that item adopted is no mean feat when you realise that countries like Germany put forward proposals such as the protection of minorities as a global problem; the challenges for parliaments as guardians of human rights; economic sanctions and their effect and destructive effects on its people by Iraq. There was a very controversial one about fighting terrorism, but those matters were all put aside after the vote which was 895 for, 392 abstentions and 97 against, to debate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adoption of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and its implications for continued nuclear tests was put forward by New Zealand. It was co-sponsored by the Asia-Pacific group, in particular Australia and Chile. That went to a drafting committee that consisted of France, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Indonesia and Japan. Most of the work in that drafting committee was done by Leo McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I participated for part of the time. As one would expect, the French used delaying actions in trying to change the strongly worded statement. In fact, at one stage, they even suggested that we took out a paragraph which recalled the effect of nuclear explosions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I made the point that we were only using that particular statement as a matter of fact. They tried to argue the old debate about the rights and wrongs of dropping atomic weapons, but we used that example so that everybody could see the effect of a nuclear exploding device. Thank goodness it was kept in, because it strengthened the very strong motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After eight hours of debate and argument with the French delegates, I am pleased to say that the general session of the IPU eventually voted on the motion on Saturday. The results of that vote were 930 in favour, 300 abstentions and only 65 against. The 65 against included 27 votes from China and 11 from France. Interestingly, France is entitled to 17 votes from two delegates but only one of them voted; the other one, supposedly, was locked in the toilet. As we know, Senator Sherry, that is a favourite device that is used when people do not want to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even amongst the French, one of their delegates did not want to vote against this particular motion. Of course, one of their colleagues, Senegal, did vote and cast a maximum number of 17 votes. The UK used one of its votes to put up a token resistance against the motion, as did Cameroon and a few others. Since the conference, I have noticed that, in the last day or so, the United Kingdom, which has been playing a rather passive role in the nuclear testing controversy, has become much more anti-testing and this really isolates China and France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to report on our good friends from India. There was a ballot for the executive positions and there was controversy about which candidates Australia should support. We had to make a decision on three candidates: one from Korea, one from China and one from India. Needless to say, at the end of the day, the Chinese candidate was not elected and the candidate from India, the candidate from Korea, and the other recommended candidates that had already been decided, were elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report that Australia had a very successful conference. We had the opportunity of putting the point of view of the South Pacific and the other Pacific nations as far as the test ban treaty is concerned. It cemented our relationship with New Zealand because we worked very closely with them and I think they really appreciated our support in this matter. I also think the Japanese and the Chileans appreciated the support that they received and the work that was put into this by Leo McLeay and other members of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to put this on the record today before some of these matters passed from memory. I would like to congratulate my fellow members of the delegation for the very hard work that was put in because we lacked a few members due to illness. Finally, I was impressed with the progress that seems to have been made in Romania since it became a free state. It is one of the biggest receivers of Australian exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was staggered by the palace in Bucharest. It was erected by the former dictator, Ceausescu, to his memory. A place that consisted of something like 6,000 rooms, took 20 years to build, took two million people to build and took 25 per cent of the gross domestic product for 20 years while the rest of the country starved, is not a very good example of communism in any shape or form. It is still not completed. I doubt if it ever will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it certainly did provide a venue that was described by some as stunning; others described it as disgusting. It must, I suppose, be seen in years to come as being&mdash;probably not one of the wonders of the world&mdash;like a lot of other structures that have been erected by dictators. It will be something to look back on in awe and remember, and perhaps it may be a memorial to a very bad government&mdash;the government that put a dictatorship before the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people are recovering well from that regime. There seems to be food in the shops at last. And that was the reason they had the revolution, of course&mdash;because they did not have any food, amongst a lot of other things. There seems to be quite an improvement in the situation in Romania and we were certainly treated very well. I would like to put on the record our appreciation to our hosts for doing such a fine job in the running of this conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the couple of minutes remaining, I would just like to touch on a couple of matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Senators Herron and Ian Macdonald gave us an outline of their seven-day tour of western Queensland. Like them, I was in rural Queensland last week&mdash;I was in Queensland for four days&mdash;but I went to the town of Monto, mainly to consult with rural groups, particularly women's groups, about the drought. It has been mentioned here today that some people think the drought is over: well, it is not. The region I visited has had little rain for five years. The purpose of my visit, discussions and consultations was to listen to the community and consult with them about our drought policy. It really is very tragic and heart-rending to visit a drought area such as rural Queensland and talk to the local communities about their particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, very briefly: Senator Abetz made an extraordinary attack on Mr Con Sciacca, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I did by way of a point of order draw to the Senate's attention the precedents that Senator Abetz broke in launching into a very controversial area, which is not the norm in matters of public interest. I think what was even worse about Senator Abetz's attack on Mr Sciacca is that it involved a mixture of accusations about a former member of his staff, apparently involved in a relationship with a member of the backbench in the other place and her alleged dismissal and the reasons why she was allegedly dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into this place believing that there are three issues you do not talk about involving members of parliament. One is their relationships with staff, one is their personal lives and one is their physical appearance. If Senator Abetz wants to lower the standard of debate and talk about ministers and their staff and their relationships with staff, then that is up to him. It does not really reflect on Senator Abetz very well. He is rapidly becoming known not as the Senator for Tasmania but the senator for sleaze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say to members of the opposition is that if you want Senator Abetz to make the sorts of accusations and speeches he did during the debate on matters of public interest, which was not supposed to be controversial, you should have a look at your own relationships with your own families and your own staff. If you want that sort of sleaze raised in this chamber, as Senator Abetz did, at lunchtime, then you are going the right way about it. That is not a threat, it is just drawing to the attention of the Senate the precedent that Senator Abetz is creating not just by raising that sort of dirt in the Senate during discussion of matters of public interest, which is not supposed to be controversial, but by raising those sorts of issues at all. </PARA>

Dr Russell, Mr Keating's political soul mate, says he is returning to Australia to save us from the development of an American style underclass. I ask the minister: isn't it a fact that, under this Keating Labor government, Australia now has almost two million of its people living in poverty, many of whom are not receiving social security payments&mdash;many of those being small business people? The figure includes some 600,000 young Australian children. We have a situation where charity and emergency relief centres report they are as busy as they were during Mr Keating's recession we had to have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think by adding Dr Russell to the Prime Minister's staff, the level of the Prime Minister's staff will be improved, too. That is right. What Dr Russell has been quoted as referring to is from his personal experience as Australian Ambassador to the United States, and concerns the manifest evidence that one sees in major cities in the US of the existence of a permanent underclass of underprivileged people. That is a prospect held open for Australia if there were a Howard government in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Dr Russell is referring to is that the policies, to the extent that we are aware of them&mdash;certainly if one looks at the policy structures of state Liberal governments as well&mdash;are aimed at duplicating the Thatcherite, Reagan type social policies which give rise to such an underclass. It is a problem that afflicts the United Kingdom as well as the United States and some other economies in Europe. The policies that this government pursues are policies that prevent the establishment of such an underclass. They are inclusive policies aimed at ensuring that the people in unfortunate circumstances in Australian society have a safety net and are properly protected, and that their levels of protection are improved and increased commensurate with their needs and the ability of the economy to pay.</PARA>

The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee on rural adjustment debt and reconstruction was chaired, of course, by his colleague, Senator Brownhill.

The Committee believes that responses and solutions should be directed to the sources of these problems rather than their repercussions.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agrees with evidence that the underlying causes of poor profitability on some farms are fragile business structures, inadequate management performance and insidious land degradation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also agrees that improved business management performance is the key to tackling these causes, thereby developing a strong competitive and sustainable farm sector.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Reynolds for her question and her obvious interest in small business which, of course, is never forthcoming from the other side. Yesterday the fifth annual review of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business in Australia</EMPHASIS> was tabled in the parliament. I noticed Senator Baume and Senator Murphy commented upon the report yesterday. Senator Baume was the only opposition spokesperson who referred to it. While I do not agree with his remarks, at least he took the trouble to make some comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before tabling, the report was distributed at the international small business conference held in Adelaide in mid-September. It comprehensively outlines the range of initiatives that this government has taken to assist small business. That is a matter which this parliament can debate because the document has been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reynolds asked me specifically about the major issue coming up for discussion and which will be before the parliament soon. I refer to the government's proposals to address the issue of the Trade Practices Act and how it will operate to help small business in Australia. I announced the policy on that some three or four weeks ago and said that in the near future I would release an exposure draft of the actual amendments to the Trade Practices Act in this area. I anticipate that by the middle of next week that exposure draft will be made public. It will be made public for about a month and members of the Australian community&mdash;particularly the business community&mdash;will be able to comment on the technicalities of the drafting. The government will be more than happy to take fine tuning to ensure that what we have drafted carries out the effect of our policy announcement some three or four weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the major thrust of these amendments, which are very much in response to the small business community's concerns as expressed to the government, deals with the issue of prohibiting harsh or oppressive conduct in the following three circumstances: firstly, when two parties are in a pre-existing commercial relationship which relationship may or may not be based on a contract; secondly, when the nature of that relationship gives one party significant advantage in bargaining power&mdash;the most common cause would be where one party cannot leave the relationship without incurring substantial costs; and, thirdly, when the stronger party knowingly exploits that advantage to engage in conduct or impose terms and conditions of a contract that are subject to a reasonable person test outside prevailing market conditions. As I said, that is the policy intent; the actual drafting we will release next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find interesting is that, since we announced the policy intent three or four weeks ago, we have had overwhelming support from the genuine small business organisations in Australia. Public comments, public statements and letters have been coming to the government saying, `At long last. Thank you very much for taking this action.' Two organisations&mdash;the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry&mdash;have said they oppose the recommendations. They oppose the change. I think the problem they have is that they do not know whether they represent big business or small business, and have some difficulty sorting that out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most glaring omission is that in the last three weeks the opposition has made no comment on whether it supports or opposes these amendments. Despite all the rhetoric of Mr Howard that small business is the number one issue for him at next election, he cannot comment on whether he supports improving the Trade Practices Act to strengthen the  bargaining power of small business people in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It makes you wonder why anybody would deliberately set out to legislate to deny people access to information and deny people the right to distribute information. And the answer is fairly simple. They perceive a partisan political advantage, because they detect, as we know, that there is likely to be a correlation between the socioeconomic characteristics of people voting informally and people who have a propensity to vote Labour. They think that, if they restrict this information, they will get a partisan political advantage, particularly from those of a non-English speaking background, who do not get benefit from the advertising that is presented otherwise and who can get access to information to assist them with their voting, to implement their voting intention, by the distribution of how to vote information. To say it can be done 100 metres away or, with respect to Senator Lees, 500 metres away, you might as well say it can be done on Cocos Island, because it is of no practical value to any citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do they want to deny people the right to this information?

They lift their inadequacy and make it a virtue. But it is a very small fig leaf covering your virtue, I have to tell you. It is a serious problem about our democracy and it should not be being done here. I am advised that the Minister for Administrative Services will be seeking legal advice on the constitutional appropriateness of imposing such restrictions on information consistent upon the High Court decision on the implied right of freedom of speech in our constitution. Now that they have made that decision it needs to be consistently applied and applied as a matter of protection of freedom of speech.</PARA>

In December last year, Minister, you opened the northern suburbs Migrant Resource Centre in Mirrabooka in Western Australia. Given the phenomenal population growth in Perth's outer northern suburbs, and given the fact that the area is increasingly attractive to migrants of non-English speaking background, can you inform the Senate how the new centre is keeping pace with demand and how its services have developed over its 10-month existence?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2032" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must thank Senator McKiernan not just for his question today but also for his continued strong personal support for the northern suburbs Migrant Resource Centre. As he points out, I opened the centre at the end of last year. I did so having decided to act on a recommendation to relocate Perth's northern Migrant Resource Centre from the inner suburbs to the area of greatest need&mdash;that is, the outer northern suburbs of Perth. We chose that area particularly, as Senator McKiernan mentions, because that part of the country is growing. In fact, migration is at the core of the growth in that particular region of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of that growth, it is worth placing on the record that between the two censuses of 1986 and 1991 the proportion of residents in the city of Wanneroo who were of non-English speaking background jumped by 34 per cent. In fact, in the neighbouring city of Stirling it jumped by 31 per cent. In looking at the similar sets of figures and assessments released regularly by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research, it is clear that those figures will be at an even higher level at the next census.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We felt this was the appropriate place to start the northern suburbs Migrant Resource Centre. I was pleased to be able to make that decision last year. I was also pleased to go back there last week to see how the centre had developed a range of comprehensive and impressive services over a very short period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are working with a core funded staff of four people and three grant-in-aid workers. In doing so, they provide advocacy, referral and welfare services. They have also established cooperative arrangements with other agencies which work from the MRC from time to time to look after clients and to manage programs. As well, they have also run an extremely impressive and successful campaign to involve the local community as members. At least 340 or 350 people are members of the MRC today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To justify the decision to take the centre out there, the MRC's caseload will give you an idea of how busy it has been. In the first eight months of this year, the MRC helped some 1,400 clients from 75 different countries of origin. The demand for casework assistance has been greatest from people who arrived in WA from the former Yugoslavia, Burma, Vietnam, the Philippines, Rumania, Afghanistan, Iraq, India and several other African countries. For instance, in terms of community involvement, over the period from June to September this year more than 1,000 people used the centre for meetings, classes and community functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demands are increasing, Senator McKiernan. I am sure you would know that. They are increasing to such a level where more space is needed particularly as bodies like the community policing council of WA, the welfare rights and advocacy service, the Vietnamese community in WA and Relationships Australia have full-time or sessional workers operating from the premises. In response to this, I have decided to provide funds to get additional premises so the MRC can accommodate these valuable workers. The premises are next door and they will be used to provide extension space for the MRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the MRC has gone so well in such a short time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has made its attitude clear through statements by Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Punch on several occasions. There is a slight contradiction, I suspect, in your question in which you point out that the position Australia took was not accepted, but then go on to say that we should take a more extreme position that would be even less acceptable. We had to make the decision as to what we thought was possible but did not prove to be possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, our position was as follows: anti-personnel mines are different from other weapons inasmuch as they remain in continuance after the conflict has finished. That is apart from their general misuse which is a secondary issue. Our attitude was that all anti-personnel mines in inventories should be detectable and should have a self-destruct mechanism so that they do not remain a continuing problem as they have around the globe in countries that you know well such as Cambodia, Afghanistan, Mozambique, Angola&mdash;and, indeed, we still have many mines going back into the Alamein area in Libya and Egypt at the moment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our attitude was that, if you could make all anti-personnel mines detectable and self-destructive, many of the problems would disappear. We had the support of a less than a majority of nations for that at the recent conference. Those advocating a total ban would not have numbered more than 10 or 12, in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that none of those countries, other than Cambodia, is willing yet to take the step to take anti-personnel mines out of its own inventory. So even those countries that have been advocating a total ban have not been taking them out of their inventory. Our attitude to this particular question is not to throw up our hands in despair but to persist in our lobbying efforts around the globe in time for the next conference&mdash;which I think is in June next year&mdash;to again push the position and to at least establish the intermediary step of making all anti-personnel mines detectable and self-destructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are putting on ourselves the long-term goal of eliminating these weapons out of inventories around the globe as the following step. But before anyone gets too starry-eyed on this, Senator Harradine, I also have to put this cautionary note down that no-one else seems to be saying: that is, once you have done that, you will not eliminate anti-personnel mines from around the globe. These are things that can be built in garages or anywhere else. For those who have the malicious intention to misuse these weapons and to damage other people, they will continue to do so. Clearly, if you could get a total ban in the long term, you would restrict some access. You would not run into the problem of their being used for legitimate purposes and then having a continuing life and maiming people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that the Australian government has in any way taken a heartless or an intrusive position on this particular issue.

<PARA>The answer of Senator Cook was totally misleading, hopefully given in ignorance, because otherwise he would have known that what he was saying was untrue. The company that has been successful has to be 60 per cent Australian owned, for a start. The minister was suggesting that it was to be a foreign company.

It is a ridiculous approach by the minister. It is wrong in the first place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Abetz, have a look at what your leader, Tim Fischer, said about him. I agree, Senator Brownhill, with Tim Fischer's assessment of Dr Russell and the impact that he has had in Washington and his `access to the White House'. That is a great compliment indeed to have from the Leader of the National Party. This government, of course, will ensure that the all-important negotiations on the US farm bill are continued as effectively as they have been to this point in time, despite the fact that Dr Russell is coming back to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane this day, relating to an industrial dispute in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the outrageous government supported blockade of Western Australia by the TLC and the ACTU, there are some observations I wish to make about Senator Cook's answer. Firstly, I want to deal with the situation with regard to the staff of Labor members being on strike. Senator Cook insinuated today that that was tied up with yesterday's strike. It has nothing whatsoever to do with yesterday's strike. It is because their enterprise bargaining has broken down under the federal award under which they are operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons they went out on strike is that, under the Western Australian system, wage increases over the last couple of years have been more than double the average of what they have been under the federal system. That is the principle thing behind it. To try to mislead this chamber in that way is irresponsible of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point concerns the comments by Ms George, chairman elect of the ACTU, that we will now see the focus move to industry-by-industry action. Relating to that question is my charge that there is a conspiracy behind this in the lead-up to the election, and that is borne out. One of Senator Cook's problems as a minister of the crown is that he cannot forget his old trades and labour council days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has to threaten people. He did it to me across this chamber today when he said: `Don't you dare ask me a question about conspiracy.' He also did it in the answer when he said, `the best way industries can indemnify themselves against further industrial action is by ensuring a federal Labor government is elected at the next election'. In other words, he is saying that this industrial incitement is going to continue until the election and then, if they do not get elected, is going to continue afterwards. If that isn't threatening the people of Australia and, in particular, the people of Western Australia, I don't know what is threatening a state or individuals. Senator Cook should rethink his position. We see the position adopted in the headlines today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Power next target on unions' hit-list'. What is going to come after that? There are proper ways to respond to these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge, as I did yesterday, the fact that at least the Opposition Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia has come out once again against this blockade in the state. Not one of those people sitting on the other side of the chamber did that. They supported the blockading of the most productive, profitable state in this Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Richard Court said yesterday, if Bill Clinton were to do something like this in America against Texas there would be civil war, and there should be because of the behaviour of people like yourself. You, minister Schacht, get up there and talk about small business and how important it is, yet you will be part of boycotting the most successful small businesses in this country. You cannot hold your head up in this place. Let me come back once again to what Senator Cook said in that answer today. He said, `The best way industries can indemnify themselves against further industrial action is by ensuring a federal Labor government is elected at the next election'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is not going to bow down. Business in Western Australia responded in such a way yesterday that they kept working. In virtually every workplace that was forced not to work the employees agreed themselves to make up that time without penalty. That is their attitude. They will not be intimidated by the actions of this government. They will not be intimidated by the actions of the ACTU. Nor will they be intimidated by the actions of the TLC, or anybody else for that matter. It is unbelievable that we have a minister of the crown here today threatening me and endorsing by default the comments by Jennie George with regard to the action yesterday and what she said on the steps of Parliament House in Western Australia. It was a very sad day yesterday, given what occurred. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, has not wanted to do anything or say anything. He wanted to have a position that is not a position at all. This is a demonstration of the leopard never changing his spots.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment before the chair is to prohibit the export of woodchips derived from natural native forests as from 1 January 2000. It is a bald cut-off point, that is the end of woodchips. It is important to understand that at the moment the government is concluding a process of establishing criteria, with the cooperation to varying degrees of state governments, to establish a nationally consistent reserve system right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in December 1994 that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that this year a ceiling of about 6 million tonnes would apply, subject to special circumstances, to export licences with respect to woodchips sourced from native forests. To be precise, the Prime Minister has clarified that the ceiling will be 6.025 million tonnes for 1995. Each individual application for an export licence for hardwood woodchips will continue to be assessed on its merits. The ceiling is an integral part of the government's approach to dealing with applications for woodchip licences and forest policy in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2000, the government will ban the export of hardwood woodchips from native forests in areas which are not covered by a regional forest agreement. This is a responsible and proper way to deal with the contentious issue of woodchip exports. It will not put a blanket prohibition of zero from 1 January 2000 regardless of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the development of our comprehensive forest policy, it is important to have an appropriate balance in managing Australia's forests. The approach of the government will be both to protect the forest conservation values and to maintain ecologically sustainable production of wood and paper products. The government's policy is based on the national forest policy statement, which has been endorsed by all state and territory governments. Senator Bell would be aware that last year Tasmania was not a signatory to that document but has since become a signatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short-term implementation of our policy involves identifying areas that are known as DFA, deferred forestry areas, from which a comprehensive, adequate and representative forest conservation reserve system will be developed. This cannot be done overnight. The time frame will vary from region to region and state to state because of the differing levels of scientific data available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this government can be proud of the lead we have taken in developing criteria for conservation reserves that are world's best practice. We are seeking in this period to conclude negotiations and establish the criteria with the various parties, including industry and environment groups and the state governments. That will be going to cabinet some time in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current period for public consultation on the draft criteria will be used as the basis for issuing the woodchip export licences for next year. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that there will be a 20 per cent reduction in export volumes which will apply in states which refuse to cooperate with the Commonwealth. Hopefully, none of the states  will refuse to cooperate with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term policy has two components&mdash;the regional forest agreements and the wood and paper industry strategy. The assessment of the RFAs, as they are known, includes the assessment of the economic and social as well as the environmental and heritage values of forests in a region. This will provide industry with secure access to resources but it will also identify development opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell, like myself, comes from Tasmania and we know that there are a number&mdash;and I do not think it is idle speculation&mdash;of proposed MDF plants, medium density fibreboard plants. I think they are serious proposals. There is also a proposal from Taiwan Pulp and Paper&mdash;I think that is the name of the company&mdash;to establish a new pulp and paper mill. There are some significant proposals for downstreaming the significant woodchip export resource from Tasmania. The industry has to have some security of resource for those proposals to advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wood and paper industry strategy will chart the way forward for an internationally competitive and sustainable industry to produce high value added products. There will inevitably be woodchip by-products from forestry operations. What do you do with that product? You can either burn it on the forest floor, which I think is an atrocious waste of a resource as well as not being particularly environmentally friendly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the importance of industry policy and value adding, I think it is dreadful that we export hundreds of millions of dollars of woodchips. We have a net deficit in forest products that I think is now approaching $2 billion. Imports of pulp and paper and pulp and various other forest products have skyrocketed. Yet we are exporting hundreds of millions of dollars of woodchips. </PARA>

We could be a net exporter of forest products from this country. The simple slogan and solution of the Democrats and the Greens is: ban woodchip exporting from native forests. That is your simple solution, but that is not the solution to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have laid out in my comments here this afternoon the proposal of the government. It is a phase-down of woodchip exports from areas that are not based on our proposed criteria but regionally assessed as suitable for logging. It is a matter of developing a creative and imaginative industry policy, very detailed, to strike a satisfactory balance between the requirements of industry and the need for a sustainable forest industry&mdash;and our policy is based on sustainability&mdash;as well as the important environmental considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposed 15 per cent of pre-settlement forest types are put aside throughout Australia, by international comparisons&mdash;of which 10 per cent is the norm&mdash;we would have the most comprehensive and highest proportion of forests of any region of the world in a reserve system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just conclude my remarks on this very important issue and would urge the chamber to reject this simplistic amendment of the Democrats by alerting people to the sorts of consequences of the approach that they are taking. Looking at the forest industry in my home state of Tasmania&mdash;I know Tasmania is geographically relatively small to the rest of Australia and we do not have the same economic weight, but about 55 per cent of Australian woodchips come from Tasmania, well over half the good quality timbers in Australia are in Tasmania and about 12 per cent of the employment in Tasmania is in the forest industries, direct and indirect&mdash;certainly there have been some job losses, as Senator Robert Bell said, but you do not need to then follow his logic and say that you should shut the entire industry, which is what he is advocating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania also has significant value adding products such as paper and pulp, MDF, craft and furniture. The industry is interrelated; it is not just a woodchipping industry. You should not be advocating policies of this type, Senator Bell, when you know the economic outcome of them in our home state would be catastrophic. In my own home city of Burnie, we have 16 per cent unemployment but, by any reasonable calculation, with no forest industry we would have 28 per cent unemployment&mdash;and that would be replicated right through other areas of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I had not been into most of the forests around Australia and actually seen what is going on on the ground, I might have been moved to tears by what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) was saying. But the claim that he made that somehow or other the Australian Democrats are responsible for wood remaining on the forest floor and being unused is absolutely untrue. The reason that about 30 per cent of useable wood is left on forest floors, whether you go into Queensland, the northern part of New South Wales, southern New South Wales, Tasmania, or the south-west of Western Australia, simply has to do with the structure of the industry itself. The logs which they take back to the mills very often are sent in to the chippers and the large limbs which are cut off are simply left on the forest floor, and very often burnt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 30 per cent of the available timber is wasted. That has nothing to do with the attitude of the Democrats in relation to protection of old-growth forests. It has to do with the chipping industry, which has set up these poor devils who drive the trucks in a structure in which they buy their trucks&mdash;they spend their $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000 for a truck&mdash;and they are paid on the tonnage of wood which they deliver to the mill. It is in their interest simply to take the logs and deliver them to the mill rather than take a mobile chipper out into the forest, chip the whole tree and deliver the whole material to the chippers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely untrue and flies in the face of all the evidence that timber is left there because we, the Democrats, somehow are opposed to the building of a mill. It is because of the structure of the industry; and it is a structure that could have been addressed by this government. Hopefully, it will be under the amendment which the government has inserted into this legislation at a late stage. I would ask it to do this&mdash;to administer the areas from which those chips for export come&mdash;in such a way that this does not occur. If a tree is cut down the whole tree should be used and the parts which are not suitable for sawn timber should finish up in chips, not simply left on the forest floor to be burnt or to rot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the claim that somehow or other we are going to throw people out of work, as a member of the conservation movement since the mid-1950s let me tell the parliamentary secretary that for at least 25 years every one of the national conservation bodies has put pressure on and pleaded with successive federal and state governments to expand the area of plantations. They have been pleading, getting down on bended knee and saying, `We want to get out of forests. We desperately need to expand the area of plantations.' There have been inadequate plantations established. Consequently, now in the late 1990s we are still going into old-growth forests and chopping those forests down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the fault of the conservation movement or the Democrats, it is the fault of the former Liberal government, the present Labor government at the national level and successive governments around Australia of various persuasions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we do have plantations in my state of South Australia, those plantations are being inadequately used. The reason, again, can be put down fairly and squarely to the failure of this federal government to fund a rail line which would link Mount Gambier and the national rail system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that mill could produce enough sawn timber to replace the timber which is cut from non-sustainable native forests in Western Australia for the purpose of house framing. The reason it does not do that is that the line between Mount Gambier and Wolesley has been cut off because of the standardisation of the Adelaide-Melbourne rail line. The broad gauge line has been left there. So you have one of the largest paper mills&mdash;you talked about paper mills&mdash;the Kimberly-Clark mill in the south-east of South Australia, producing 100,000 tonnes of paper a year yet they have to send that out on trucks. That is a very inefficient way of getting that material into the market. It must be almost unique in the world. That major mill, which wants to expand, is being inhibited by the failure of a suitable rail transport system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auspine plant is cutting less timber than is being produced because of the speed with which the pine trees in the plantation are growing. That plant could provide timber to the Perth market cheaper than one could get that timber for house framing out of the native forests of Western Australia, all for the want of $5 million which is required from the federal Department of Transport to upgrade that line.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you worked to improve amendments so that they were more acceptable to the majority, I do not think the majority of the Senate would complain. The Greens obviously are extremely concerned about the export woodchip industry and its impact on the high conservation value forests throughout Australia, in particular, of course, in the south-west of Western Australia. In this latest proposal, which some people call the deferred forests assessment but other people call by far less favourable names, our karri and our jarrah forests are under great threat. Of course, woodchipping devastates our red gum or marri forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first clause of the amendments that have been moved by Senator Bell&mdash;that is, 9A(1)&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The export of wood chips obtained or derived from natural native forests is prohibited on and from 1 January 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding, even though I understand there has been some moving away from it, is that that is no different from the commitment that had already been made by the government. So it is no considerable advance that will protect our high conservation value forests. We propose amending Senator Bell's amendment&mdash;I would be glad of his feedback on this&mdash;so that it would read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The export of wood chips obtained or derived from natural native forests is prohibited on and from 1 January 1998. This is based on a 33 1/3 per cent reduction for each year beginning 1996, 1997 and 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from that, we do not see how this aspect of the amendment will protect the old-growth and high conservation value native forests that are under threat from the existing policy on woodchip exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 2 imposes a penalty of imprisonment of five years or a fine of $100,000. The Greens have often announced our policy on imprisonment, which concurs with that of the state government. Imprisonment is a penalty of last resort and should be used that way. It should only be used to protect the community from physical danger and to protect somebody who is a danger to themselves as well as to the community. We do not agree with imprisonment for five years. We would agree with the fine of $100,000 if it were for each offence and not just a one-off. If it is a one-off, $100,000 is just a little fee for continuing to exploit our native forests. It will be no disincentive whatsoever to the woodchip industry continuing on its devastating path. The industry will perhaps complain because there will be a slight increase in the monetary costs it will have to pay. The main cost of the woodchip export industry is being paid for by the community at large because of the subsidies on the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to insert a third clause. It relates to a transitional industry strategy to be put in place which allows transitional arrangements and compensation to workers who are disadvantaged financially by a move from native forests to plantations. I am not sure whether Senator Bell is able to answer those queries, but that is what I would like to see. Would he be willing to agree with an amendment that made it a more stringent requirement to phase out the woodchip exports? Could he explain the reasons behind the penalty and whether it would be for each offence or simply for each company? Would the inclusion of some kind of transitional strategy be acceptable to him?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My answer to the first proposition from Senator Chamarette is that our reason for proposing the first paragraph was quite simply that it is stated prime ministerial direction. We did expect support from the Australian Labor Party. I cannot understand why that extra drivel was provided to us by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry). He could have just accepted it, sat down and got through it. We would have had one minute on this and that would have been about it. The Democrats' reason for choosing that date is that it is the government's date. It is a little like the nuclear debate. We have been attempting on so many occasions to give the government an opportunity to vote for its own policy, to entrench in legislation its own hyperbole and to see whether we can do something with regard to action rather than promises. That was our sole motivation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see considerable merit in hastening this process. At the moment, we are in 1996. The government has us locked into this six million tonne export paradigm. As you would appreciate, it is extremely difficult to extract ourselves from it. The Democrats would be pleased to see this circus stop tomorrow. I recognise the practicality of trying to extract ourselves from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will continue to make promises. We could well see the six million tonnes of woodchips being shipped away from Australia and disappearing over the horizon year after year. It has not done anything to implement the promises made by former Prime Minister Hawke and current Prime Minister Keating. It is entertaining to us to look at a stricter implication of this, but I am repeating that my reasons for doing this were to invite the government to deliver on its own promise. Secondly, I will explain the penalties. It was my intention that they be for each offence. Thirdly, Senator Chamarette, your additional paragraph on a transitional strategy is most attractive. That is where the government is lacking. We do not see any evidence of action there either. If during the process of moving the other amendments you propose that paragraph, we will support it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to the specific amendments that have been foreshadowed. I do not know whether you understand the serious consequences of your amendment if it were put into effect. I will give you an example of what would happen in Tasmania. Forestry, by its nature, is an integrated industry. When you log an area, you are lucky to get 30 to 50 per cent of timber that is suitable for building materials of sawlog quality. You are very lucky if you can get that quantity of timber with current technology. What do you do with the waste? You can either burn it or use it as chip, export it or, hopefully, keep it in this country and convert it into pulp, paper and other products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, by utilising the waste product, it is more economical to log. If you end chipping, in effect, you end the logging of very significant areas of forest. That is the effect of it. By knocking down the export woodchip quantities by a third each year over the timetable&mdash;and you have suggested that we should have plantations in its place&mdash;you are effectively saying that you would virtually end, within three years, the entire forest industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You accept that it should be replaced by plantations. I do not accept that you can do that, because, for scientific reasons, many of the species of trees that are currently harvested cannot yet be grown successfully in plantations. Assuming your premise that plantations should replace it, how can you grow sufficient timber in Tasmania in three years to replace the entire native industry that you have wiped out in three years? What are the consequences of stopping the logging of native forests in Tasmania in three years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say that there will be a transitional strategy and that the government will have to pay for the disadvantage of those involved being put out of work because of your proposal.

Very rough notes have been circulated in the chamber because we obviously have been doing this on the run. I think he is quite entitled to feel that government support should have been forthcoming for his amendment. It was not at all unreasonable that he put it that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, if the government is going to renege even from its own policy and not support the amendment, I cannot see any value whatsoever in putting an amendment that goes against what both the Democrats and the Greens already fervently believe&mdash;that we should be doing it a lot earlier. I welcome the Democrat's support for the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on Senator Sherry's criticisms that if we were fair dinkum about the strategy we would not have done it so quickly. It was government strategy to move it out. If the government was fair dinkum it should already have something in place that would not make our amendments at all unreasonable because we have only moved it forward by two years. The government has had a lot of time since it made that commitment to put mechanisms in place that would allow movement across and out of the kind of wholesale woodchipping reliance that the industry has come to be so dependent upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more than time when alternative transition strategies should be offered as incentives to the industry to go on to a more sustainable basis which will protect and ensure the future of the people who have been employed in the forest industries and whose jobs are being continually shed&mdash;not because of any conservation movement, action or protection, but simply because the scale of equipment and technology that is being used in the industry has led to a wholesale shedding of jobs over the last 30 years. That transitional strategy is a very sensible one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the parliamentary secretary thinks that there is some pain in it, I think the pain should be on the government. It should be an incentive to the government to put something in place that assists the workers and addresses the employment difficulties that they might face. The parliamentary secretary's concerns about plantations and phasing out from one native forest focused industry into plantation, agroforestry or even regrowth lower conservation value forests is something that is quite achievable. The conservation movement has been prepared all along to provide assistance and cooperation in that area. A very impressive plantation study has been undertaken by Dr Judith Clarke which shows that it would be within Australia's capacity to phase into plantations almost immediately. It illustrates a lack of political will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to get that, I assure my colleagues here and people in the community, if the government is continually politicising it and making it a fight between the workers and the conservation movement when it really is the government that benefits from the politicisation and polarisation. The government does not have to do anything. It does not have to amend any of its quotas or any of the woodchip export licences accept those that it feels it can bargain with pre-election. It is a disgrace that there is not a transition strategy in place that we could refer to instead of actually having a clause in the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a proposal to reduce the period of time for the cessation of the exporting of woodchips. Woodchipping currently occurs at a domestic level and is likely to go on at a domestic level for a long period of time because it is part of the process of making wood into paper and various other things. I say to Senator Bell and Senator Chamarette that, even if we are able to move to a plantation based industry right now or next year, we would still have a situation where there would be some residue from those plantations after cutting down the trees and processing certain parts of the trees. There would be residue wood and we would have to do something with it. I think it is important that we take account of that.

It is the stuff that is easy to handle and it is the stuff which fits on the truck. You don't see a truck of limbs, ends and inconvenient pieces.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act provides that an exploration permit may be granted subject to conditions as the joint authority thinks fit and as are specified in the permit, that is, in subsection 33(1). One such condition, that has been a standard condition of exploration permits for the last 12 years, allows specifically for exploration work to be carried out in advance of commitments and for the designated authority, that is the relevant state minister for mines, to create this work against future commitments. This condition is set out in full in the administrative guidelines issued in support of the act. </PARA>

The registered holder is free to exceed this minimum program and, indeed, is encouraged to do so. There may be many reasons why companies would wish to accelerate their work programs. Recognising the considerable costs associated with offshore exploration, it may be more cost-effective for a company to complete more than the minimum amount of work in a given year to take advantage of the availability of a seismic survey or a drilling vessel. The condition allowing the crediting of work undertaken in advance was designed to encourage and accelerate efficient exploration. For that reason we do not believe the amendment is necessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1995 amends the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to expand and consolidate Australia's implementation of the 1992 amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, made under the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. Furthermore, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1989 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Import) Act are to be replaced by new bills: the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture Bill) 1995 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our consultations have revealed widespread support for the bill, not the least amongst industry groups. The Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers and Manufacturers, often referred to as AFCAM, in particular, have been very supportive of this bill. The ozone layer of the upper atmosphere is affected by the release of chlorine based gases, predominantly CFCs. These chemical compounds are used as refrigerants, foam blowing agents and propellants. Some 90 per cent of CFCs are produced and released in the northern hemisphere but global wind patterns have resulted in ozone depletion over the Antarctic. Commonly known as the ozone hole, this is the result of air movements mainly in the southern hemisphere spring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Antarctic ozone hole was similar to the 1993 hole, which was the deepest and largest on record. The 1994 ozone hole was slightly larger in area, with a maximum aerial extent of over 24 million square kilometres, occurring at the beginning of October. Another feature of the 1994 ozone hole was the abnormally high ozone values at mid latitudes to the south of Australia and New Zealand. I understand that volcanic aerosols from the 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines, which were present in the Antarctic stratosphere in 1992 and 1993, were thought to have contributed to the intense level of ozone destruction observed in these years but were not present in 1994 and yet the level of ozone destruction was similar to that observed in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some debate and some statements in the press about the extent of the ozone hole in 1995. I understand that it was recently announced by the World Meteorological Organisation that there was a 22 million square kilometre sized hole. This apparently compares with the 1994 hole size of 24 million square kilometres. It would be interesting to get the government's view on this because there has been some concern expressed by the media about the extent of that hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Paul Fraser of the CSIRO's Division of Atmospheric Research in Melbourne believes that the time it will take for the ozone layer to completely recover is 50 to 100 years. The measured levels of chlorine in the lower atmosphere have nearly stabilised. However, it will take at least three years for this to flow through to the upper atmosphere where ozone depletion occurs. Projections made by Dr Fraser indicate that troposheric chlorine in the southern hemisphere will stop growing between 1996 and 1999. Northern hemispheric and global atmospheric chlorine levels are likely to stop growing earlier but within a year of the southern hemispheric levels, probably between 1995 and 1998. Dr Fraser expects the stratospheric chlorine levels to peak some three to five years later. However, the stratospheric chlorine levels are likely to remain sufficiently high to initiate spring time ozone holes, at least according to the research, until the year 2015. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Montreal protocol has by and large been successful. Twice altered to toughen its provisions, it has seen a 70 per cent cut in the consumption of ozone depleting gases since 1986. The global phase-out of CFCs is well ahead of UN targets. Industrialised countries, I understand, have virtually eliminated the production of CFC solvents, refrigerants and spray can propellants along with halon gases used in fire extinguishers. They have agreed to halt all production and importing of almost all ozone destroying gases by the end of this year and to establish time tables for phasing out the remainder. The Montreal protocol applies to developing countries but the CFC phase-out dates are some time in the future. Malaysia and India, for example, have until the year 2010 to complete a phase-out, with the process being scheduled to commence in 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China recently announced that it would stop using CFCs in refrigerators by the year 2005 if developed countries provide it with enough money and technology. China is the largest consumer of CFCs in the developing world and it plans to build, I understand, some nine million refrigerators this year. Dr Fraser, whom I referred to earlier, has commented that `overall the Montreal protocol is working, both in developed and developing countries.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, Australia is ahead of the rest of the world in its phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. This is especially so with the HCFCs. The Australian cap of 300 ozone depleting potential tonnes, which was endorsed by cabinet in October 1984 and by ANZECC in April 1985, is about one-half of the limit Australia is allowed under the Montreal protocol. The smaller limit has a further effect on limiting subsequent phase-out stages which are a percentage of the initial Australian cap. The rationale behind the lesser figure is that it meets the needs of Australian industry and will be an incentive to prepare for reduced HCFC supply.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Running very quickly through what this package of bills does, it amends the Ozone Protection Act, the principal act, to expand and consolidate Australia's implementation of the 1992 amendment to the Montreal protocol. The Montreal protocol was based originally on the Vienna convention. The legislation repeals the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees&mdash;Manufacture) Act 1989 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees&mdash;Imports) Act 1989 and replaces it with new legislation. It terminates  current licences for CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, halon, methyl chloroform&mdash;more correctly, 111 trichlor ethane&mdash;and carbon tetrachloride from 31 December 1995. It establishes a new system of essential use licenses for the manufacture and import of these substances and used substances licences for these substances beyond 1 January 1996 for limited purposes under the Montreal protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It establishes an Australian cap&mdash;that is, an industry limit plus a reserve HCFC quota for the manufacture, import and export of HCFCs, the hydrofluorocarbons. It phases out the HCFCs by industry by self-regulation under a gradually reducing industry limit reaching zero, as has already been mentioned, by the year 2030. It will establish controlled substances licences for the manufacture, import and export of HCFCs below the industry limit. It will activate a two-year HCFC quota allocation period for the licences where the 90 per cent, that is, the threshold of the industry, is exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will allocate reserve HCFCs quota to licences where exceptional circumstances exist.

So far so good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has been very self-congratulatory in his second reading speech about the way in which government has over a number of years handled this situation of ozone depletion. I want to put on record that the record of this government and of the previous government prior to 1983 is atrocious. Moreover, that pattern of inadequacy is now being witnessed in another very important global environmental dimension, namely, greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to run very quickly through the history of chlorofluorocarbons and their damaging effect on  stratospheric ozone, with the consequent reduction in that ozone and an increase in ultraviolet light penetrating to the surface of the earth, with a predicted increase in skin cancers and general environmental damage in relation to a whole host of species, both animal and plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that only just the other day it was announced that the Nobel Prize for chemistry for this year was given to Drs Rowland and Molina, the two American scientists who in 1974 first posed a very significant question. We have been producing these CFCs which are remarkably stable. One of the reasons why they came into use in the 1930s was that they were so stable. We have been producing these substances since the 1930s. They asked: where the devil in the environment are they going?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some earlier work, which dates back to about 1972, had indicated that under certain conditions these substances would break down and that that could be done by intense ultraviolet light. Rowland and Molina looked around for a sink where these substances might finish up. They noted the substances were generally not soluble in water; they were not likely to be washed out of the atmosphere by rain. They postulated that these substances would rise gradually through the earth's atmosphere and get up to the stratosphere at the higher levels of 15, 20, 25 or 30 kilometres where the intense ultraviolet light would break them down. They said, `My god, when they get up there and break down, they are likely to release chlorine atoms. They will then decrease the level of ozone. Chlorine will combine with ozone and form chlorineoxide. The chlorineoxide will break down and the chlorine atom will be released and will attack another molecule of ozone. One atom of chlorine released from a CFC can then catalyse the breakdown of very large amounts of ozone.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was predicted back in 1974 that the release of these substances would lead to a decrease in the ozone layer, in the stratosphere, which in turn would lead to an increase in the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the surface of the earth. In 1976, only two years later, the National Academy of Sciences in the US had looked at this and said, `Yes, looking at the postulated reaction mechanisms we think that this is very likely.' That was in 1976. It was 1988 before the Australian government chose to move to control the use and the release of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, far from acting quickly and far from industry being responsive to very good scientific evidence from the National Academy of Sciences in the US in 1976, we saw industry resisting. Every senator in this chamber will remember the late 1970s when the phase out of CFCs in pressure pack cans was being strongly resisted by Afcam and the pressure pack can manufacturers. It was exactly like the cigarette manufacturers and the tobacco growers saying, `There is no evidence of a link between tobacco and lung cancer or various other diseases being caused by tobacco smoking.' They were defending their industry to the last saying the world would collapse, there would be a loss of jobs and everything else if they were made to control, limit or stop the use of CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then move on to the Vienna convention when a number of nations came together and were very concerned not only about ozone depletion but also about the greenhouse effect. Certain things were said about the need for nations to cooperate to head off these global atmospheric environmental threats. That then goes on to the Montreal protocol, which gave more effect to this. Eventually that protocol was implemented in Australian legislation in 1988, which was then passed into law in 1989. Interestingly, and I put this before the Senate, because of my concern, I was the one who first introduced legislation in this chamber in 1988 to control the use of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson I want to draw from this is that for a number of years we have been getting very good and reliable evidence from a number of sources that the release of a range of other gases into the atmosphere&mdash;carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and the CFC's themselves&mdash;is causing another effect: namely, the greenhouse effect. We are now seeing from this government and from Australian industry precisely the same resistance that we saw with respect to the control of ozone depleting substances through the late 1970s and throughout most of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the coal industry digging its toes in trying very hard to resist the application of the very best scientific evidence which says we need to very quickly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent. We see industry being supported by government. We saw our government go to the Berlin conference recently and resist very strongly, pleading a special case for Australia. In fact, one cannot deprecate the actions of our government, the actions of our coal industry in particular, more strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia have seen the ecologically sustainable development committees, created by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, coming out with exceptionally good recommendations as to how we could tackle this problem without in fact impacting adversely on Australian industry or the Australian economy. Quite the contrary in fact, it is causing Australian industry to move forward and be very productive which would move Australia into a good position to enter the 21st century. We see all those things being rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, pressing the analogy with the ozone depleting substances, once government set in place the requirement that we needed to get rid of CFCs, we found that indeed technology could respond. We now find industry making a virtue of necessity&mdash;and it is reflected in the minister's second reading speech. It is saying, `Aren't we good? We are now responding. We are really getting rid of these substances.' Industry can respond. Industry wants a certain future, a situation in which the government outlines to industry what is required of it and guarantees those other conditions which need to be met. Industry will respond. Technology will respond. We will be able to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was responsible for getting the greenhouse effect as a reference before the committee that used to be called the industry, science and technology committee but which is now called the economics committee. Again, right within this chamber, that committee came forward with very good recommendations in relation to reducing greenhouse gases. It outlined a number of technologies that could be used and a number of industries that could be established, stimulated and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find? We find government turning its back and adopting precisely the same attitude that it did with ozone depleting substances through all the years between 1974-76, when it became clear that we had a serious problem with respect to ozone depletion, and 1988-89, when the legislation was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the government recently adopting policies with respect to the electricity industry. It is totally turning its back on the opportunity to turn the electricity utilities in Australia into least cost energy service providers. We have seen the government rejecting the idea that even its own very weak target of a 20 per cent greenhouse gas reduction could be achieved simply by ensuring that a solar hot water service went into every house in Australia. That is very simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine what would happen to that industry in Australia. We would produce cheaper solar hot water units. We would stimulate an industry with enormous capacity to provide employment. We would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Some 90 per cent of our solar hot water units now go overseas. The unit cost of those units would come down and we could produce even better units cheaper on the overseas market. Far from the directions that I am outlining actually damaging Australian industry, damaging the Australian economy, it is quite the contrary. The industry and the economy would benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to say to the government that, with respect to ozone depleting substances, it cannot claim its record has been good. This extends back to the previous government. There was abundant and very good scientific evidence which indicated that it should have been taking action earlier. It did not do that. By analogy, it is now adopting the same head in the sand attitude with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days we have seen the foreshadowed new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change saying, `Yes, we have released a lot of greenhouse gas. We have changed the composition of the atmosphere but we are not too sure what is going to happen to the climate.' We now have the IPCC, which has some 200 world renowned scientists from a wide range of specialities saying, `Yes, we are now in a greenhouse situation and, yes, some of that global warming is due to the release of man-made gases.' It is again calling for governments to urgently respond to reduce the emission of these gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a newspaper article yesterday&mdash;and I have copy of it here&mdash;the former head of the CSIRO's division of atmospheric physics, Brian Tucker, was quite out of line with his colleagues on the IPCC by saying that we should not take any action because we do not know what the climate effects are likely to be. This government has also adopted the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle is if you are not too sure what consequences will flow from an action, particularly an action which you are taking on a global front, then you should slow down the rate of change which will flow from that action until you are pretty sure that very adverse climate consequences will not flow from that action. The IPCC has said that it is predicting a 20 per cent reduction in harvests from crops in Sub-Saharan Africa and South and South-East Asia. That is certainly a consequence which will be disastrous on a global scale, and one which should stimulate this government to take prompt action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make in my speech in the second reading debate is that I would hope not only that we would at this time be looking at improving the control of our ozone depleting substances, as we are in this legislation by moving forward to phase out these substances and by looking at a wide range of substances which have a much lower ozone depleting potential than the CFCs but nonetheless do have some ozone deleting potential and therefore should be controlled&mdash;all good stuff&mdash;but also that we would be looking as a nation at setting a pattern for the refrigeration and airconditioning industries well into the next century. We should be looking at new technologies which do not involve either the use of ozone depleting substances or the inevitable release, to some extent, of substances which have greenhouse potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the substances being considered as refrigerant gases do have considerable greenhouse potential. I think it would be crazy for us to seek to control substances which have ozone depleting potential because of their ozone depleting potential and ignore the fact that the substitutes for those substances have greenhouse potential. Therefore, one might quite literally get out of the ultraviolet fire into the greenhouse frying pan. </PARA>

Domestic refrigerators were operating with either gas or electricity and we certainly had, and still have today, very large commercial units that used ammonia. That is a technology which does not use a working gas, either a greenhouse gas or an ozone depleting gas.

To this extent, Australia is to be commended for enacting these controls to the letter in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the amendments to the Montreal protocol, the agreed method of dealing with the issue of HCFCs, themselves ozone depleting and global warming substances, was to prohibit CFC use as of 1996, replace them with HCFCs where possible and in turn initiate the phase-out of HCFCs by 2030. This was despite the fact that Switzerland and Sweden were pushing for their phase-out by 2005. Australia is to be one of the greatest affected by continuing ozone depletion. It is regrettable that we do not see these treaties as minimum standards and go above them rather than sticking to the letter of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is common knowledge now that the damage caused to the ozone layer by human made chemical substances is more related  to the number of chlorine ions let loose on the membrane thin layer of ozone protecting us from the sun's ultraviolet rays, rather than how long a given chemical substance stays in the atmosphere. Essentially, peak chlorine loading on the atmosphere is an instantaneous concept rather than a measure of ozone depleting potential averaged over 100 years. Therefore, though HCFCs are shorter lived than CFCs, compounds that inject chlorine into the atmosphere but have a relatively short lifetime will still contribute significantly to the overall ozone depletion in any given time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also becomes clear when we discuss environmental problems in the scheme of 100 years that many of the environmental models on which we base our predictions are very shaky indeed. Most of them rely on the principle of driving a car by the view in the rear vision mirror. We simply cannot predict the effect the massive amounts of CFCs, HCFCs, halons, methyl bromides, carbon monoxides, nitrous oxides, carbon tetrachlorides, HBFCs and HFCs civilisation has been pumping into the atmosphere will have on life on earth not in 100 years time but even in 20 years time. We must be basing our legislation on all possible outcomes rather than desperate adhesion to the predictions of computer banks made larger and larger to try to incorporate the effects of every possible variable. The earth is an infinitely, unimaginably complex system and we are dicing with its very make-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we risk by arbitrarily replacing CFCs with HCFCs in this manner is another technological fix, a bandaid, that constructs a fools' paradise where we thrive in ignorance while the problem continues. With results like skin cancer, cataracts, early wrinkles, increased contraction of infectious diseases through suppression of the human and animal immune system, increased acid deposition in the atmosphere, lower yields of staple agricultural crops estimated at perhaps $2 billion a year in the United States alone and the less life threatening but unfortunate side effect of degradation of paints, plastic and other polymer materials to the same economic level, it will not remain a paradise for long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most grave omission that resulted from the lowest common denominator approach to the ozone crisis by the Montreal protocol and by this act was the lack of agreement on controls on methyl bromide. Like halons and HBFCs, methyl bromides are bromide containing substances. Bromide atoms destroy hundreds of times more ozone molecules than does a chlorine atom. This omission risks placing in danger Australia's initiatives in dealing with ozone depletion, similar to turning a tap on full bore to fill up a bucket with a hole in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ideal role then of the international community in global and environmental issues therefore is to create a general spirit and the highest possible standard of action for issues that can only be dealt with effectively in a global consensus environment. The role of domestic governments then is to enact appropriately stringent, and often higher, standards in national legislation. This amendment bill should seek to do this by strengthening the enactment of the protocol to more reflect its spirit, and the reason for the direction towards global cooperation in the first place, that is, to save the ozone layer. This enactment of its spirit would firstly be by phasing out methyl bromides immediately and, secondly, by shortening the phase-out time for HCFCs dramatically. My colleague Senator Margetts will outline options for achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens approach to ozone and other environmental issues of this nature is to examine the fundamental causes of the problem and propose solutions that address the causes rather than treat the symptoms. Technological fixes that only address the symptoms will not solve the root lifestyle and philosophical issues that cause the depletion of the ozone layer and an impact on the environment in general. For example, if the government initiated a strong legislative framework for ensuring new buildings were designed so as to need minimal airconditioning&mdash;an area in which the government has published much of its own research&mdash;technological fixes that are more often than not ineffectual would not be necessary. In doing this the government could also be doubly effective by reducing greenhouse gas problems due to massive fossil fuel use in heating as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is to try to ensure that ozone depleting substances are not replaced with some chemical that creates environmental problems of a different sort, especially when the replacement chemical is covered specifically or in general under another international agreement, and where there are commercially available alternatives that don't create these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The classic example is hydroflourocarbons, which may be ozone safe but are significant greenhouse gases with global warming potentials of several thousand.

We certainly do not want to create a situation where we demand they convert from one substance only to see government a few years later demanding they convert again because the replacement creates other problems. We hope some regulation of obviously problematic replacements would reduce incidents of double conversion, with all their associated costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have substantive amendments in relation to the regulation of products using scheduled substances. While the quota on HCFCs is an example of phasing out a substance, the reason phase-out takes so long is to reduce the hardship on those who have bought equipment using the substance. It is sensible then to stop people from buying such equipment at the earliest possible date. Alternatives are already here in most cases. If not commercially developed already, they will be widely available soon. We think the time limits for equipment that we have set are reasonable, given the current state of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, while some Australian manufacturers of domestic refrigerators still use HFC refrigerants, I understand that none now use HFCs or HCFCs as foam blowing agents for insulation.

Virtually all European manufacturers use hydrocarbons, and General Electric and other US manufacturers have indicated that they will convert. In such a case, there is no reason to allow people to buy equipment which is damaging to the environment, when industry, and particularly Australian industry, provide a friendlier product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of these amendments will be minor, I believe, since in most cases industry has already converted or is converting away from ecologically damaging products.

I am not certain whether it is the same example as I am aware of, but I cite it as an example where industry and people within the community are much more ahead and constructive in their approach to these matters than often the willingness of state and federal governments to conform to those standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will describe a meeting I had three years ago with a group of refrigeration engineers involved in refrigeration and airconditioning.

A typical hydrofluorocarbon plant, for example, consumes 7.6 million litres of hydrofluoric acid per year&mdash;or 19,000 litres per day&mdash;in manufacture. Hydrofluoric acid is capable of acting even on glass, and a US test showed that a 1,000 US gallon or 3,800 litre spill would form a dense ground-hugging cloud that could prove lethal as far as five miles downwind. The potential for a Bhopal-style disaster is significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are alternatives. Together with Greenpeace, European manufacturers have developed the green freeze technologies. These mainly use hydrocarbons, HCs, which can be made by petrochemical companies like Calor or Elgas. They are cheaper and safer to manufacture, and generally safer to use from an industrial safety perspective. They are not ozone depleting substances and have a global warming potential about the same as carbon dioxide&mdash;so we are not losing out on the energy aspect. They have a coefficient of performance or efficiency about the same as or better than commonly used CFCs. They do not require the use of toxic PAG oils in refrigeration systems and can be used for most foam blowing and refrigerant applications, as well as use in aerosol cans. This accounts for the majority of current CFC applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the majority of emphasis by the World Bank has been for HFC and even HCFC technologies. This is absolutely inappropriate where funding is for projects in the less industrialised world. We are supporting transfers of technology that should already be superseded. We are talking about transfers to nations such as China, India and Brazil, with substantial populations that will soon be demanding large numbers of refrigeration equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People often say, `Would you deny technology of Australia to other countries?' when we talk about things like global warming. We would say, `Why are we exporting our level of pollution when we could be doing better here?' If we have any real concern about the environment or social justice, then we should be encouraged to develop production capability based on hydrocarbon, not fluorocarbon, technology. The only real reason for such emphasis is that decisions were made to support the large chemical companies, such as ICI and Dupont, that previously made CFCs. So the whole deal was based on making them happy. The proponents of fluorocarbons consistently point to the flammability of hydrocarbons, often resorting to scare tactics and misinformation to make their point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Hydrocarbons are flammable, although hydrocarbons used for refrigerants today are generally formulated to reduce flammability. HFCs, on the other hand, are only combustible. A major industrial accident in Germany on 18 March 1994, in which an HFC storage tank exploded, led the environment ministry to shut down the plant, and Hoechst, the producer, to shut down a sister plant in Brazil. Notes to those installing HFCs in refrigeration and airconditioning systems warn that the common practice of purging or testing lines with compressed air is dangerous and should never be attempted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> HFC companies rightly claim that, while HFCs can ignite under pressure or under conditions of exposure to high pressure air, this condition will never be met under normal use conditions. It is an industrial hazard, not a consumer hazard. I note that this week there is a union campaign on industrial safety and chemical hazards, which cause more deaths in Australia each year than automobile accidents. Hydrocarbons can ignite at atmospheric pressure. The question is whether hydrocarbons, under normal conditions of use and at normally found concentrations, represent any significant risk to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The European nations have found that, in relation to refrigerators, HCs pose no significant risk. Foams can easily be blown with hydrocarbons and the systems charged with hydrocarbon refrigerants. Only if a complete leaking occurs into a sealed compartment and there is a naked flame from a candle or cigarette lighter in the compartment&mdash;that is, if you are standing inside the refrigerator&mdash;is the hydrocarbon gas likely to ignite. Such an occurrence is extremely unlikely. I do not know about you, but there is not a lot of room in my refrigerator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be additional problems in some older fridges if CFCs are simply replaced with hydrocarbons. In some old fridges, thermostats or other electrical devices may potentially create enough of a spark to ignite a large hydrocarbon leak. Fridges designed for hydrocarbon use, on the other hand, present no significant risk. Many older fridges may be retrofitted to allow them to safely use hydrocarbons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This imposes an extra cost, but HFCs are not a simple drop-in replacement either. They are a smaller molecule, so are more subject to leak than CFCs. They are very drying for oils; so can cause breakdown and cracking in seals. The recommended procedure is to replace all seals and replace the oil that hydrofluorocarbons are dissolved in. Hydrofluorocarbons, unlike hydrocarbons, require highly toxic PAG oils. The oil change is very expensive, and some manufacturers recommend changing the compressor to deal with the reduced efficiency of the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. These changes all cost quite a lot of money, and this cost must be weighed against the cost of retrofitting for hydrocarbon use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The most contentious area of use today is for automotive airconditioning. A complete and sudden draining of hydrocarbon refrigerants into the passenger compartment could ignite, blow out windows and cause superficial burns. The question is whether this is likely to occur. Proponents of hydrofluorocarbons show dramatic pictures of windows being blown out. Proponents of hydrocarbons play hydrocarbons over all the switches, the exhaust manifold and even the distributor of a running car to show how difficult hydrocarbons are to ignite. Refrigeration engineers point out that a complete venting of all the airconditioning fluid&mdash;that is, 300 grams&mdash;into the passenger compartment is extremely unlikely, and that a slow leak would never build to flammable concentrations under normally designed ventilation conditions. Some research indicates that a sudden and total leak would dissipate to a non-flammable level in a normal car in under one minute. Meanwhile, little extensive safety testing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Cars use petroleum, which is far more flammable than hydrocarbons, and use it in far greater quantities. Petrol tanks are often separated from passenger compartments by only a sheet of cardboard. Likewise, LPG is explosive, and tanks are often located behind or beneath passenger compartments. The dangers can be seen in a film of the Ford Pinto which would explode in a ball of flame after a minor rear impact; yet no-one suggests restricting these substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is seen as sufficient to design vehicles to use the substances safely; although this cannot eliminate all risks, especially during accidents. But safety measures are generally effective and cars in accidents rarely explode in balls of flames, except in the movies. If tens of litres of petrol and LPG can be used safely in cars, it seems inconsistent to suggest that a few hundred grams of refrigerant represents an insurmountable danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No-one suggests that hydrocarbons should be used in ways where they are shown to be unsafe. But it is hard to imagine that they cannot be used safely. Certainly, for most refrigeration and stationary airconditioning applications, hydrocarbons can be used safely now and are being used safely in Europe. Given the high cost of retrofitting required for automotive use of hydrofluorocarbons&mdash;that is, between $320 and $800&mdash;it is hard to imagine cars could not be made safe for hydrocarbon use, probably at less cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard verbal reports from Elgas on tests in the US conducted in relation to the safety of hydrocarbons in automotive airconditioning that were concluded last month by Arthur B.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1995 is the last year for importation or manufacture of CFCs. Industries and businesses will need to convert now and will already be making choices about what route to go. The technologies of HFCs and HCs are different and, once committed, businesses will not want to change again in the near future. We are seeing choices made now that will affect our environment and our energy use, as well as costs to industry and consumers for many years to come. The choices will have major financial impacts on the chemical giants which are committed to making hydrofluorocarbons, on the companies that make hydrocarbons and on those companies who design and manufacture vehicles and appliances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens WA believe that HFCs can be a poor technological choice. They are greenhouse gases, demand increased energy use for the same result and present industrial, public and environmental safety issues from production. There are far better alternatives commercially available. It is not appropriate for the World Bank, the USEPA, or other agencies to support HFC technology in place of HCs. There may be areas where hydrocarbons cannot be used safely and other alternatives should then be found, but the onus is on the regulators to note problems and promote the development of the safe use for most applications. Clearly this is possible and clearly hydrocarbons are already safely in use in many applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance to the developing world should involve the best technology&mdash;and this is not HCFCs or HFCs. Potential dangers of HCs in some applications should not be used as an excuse to limit their access to markets at a commercially critical time, as the state of Queensland is threatening. If there are potential dangers, there is no excuse to delay determining whether they are real dangers and whether there are modifications which will reduce dangers to an acceptable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will always support consumer protection and a precautionary approach. But we cannot support the failure to develop safe technology as an excuse to continue environmentally destructive practice. Hydrocarbons appear to be safe for most applications or to be able to be made safe with a minimum of effort. We support European calls to phase out HCFCs and HFCs. We already know that virtually all foam blowing can and should be done without HCFCs or HFCs. Domestic refrigerators are already being produced without them, including use as refrigerants. I understand that National Railways is trialling HCs in its airconditioning system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already many applications where HCFCs or HFCs are not necessary, or not in use. There are others where there are clear alternatives&mdash;often cheaper and environmentally far better alternatives. In these cases, the Greens believe HCFCs and HFCs should not be used. It is extremely expensive for industry to convert, especially where it means changing compressors or, in the case of manufacturers, changing technologies, designs and equipment to accommodate a different type of gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we would like to avoid is a situation where double conversion is likely to be imposed. It is imperative to let industry know what options for CFC replacements will not be acceptable over the long term. This is the case for most applications of HFCS. In most applications, HCFCs are already not acceptable and, as the government has indicated through its phase out policy, will be available only as short-term transition substances. In such cases, I think we should ensure that where there are commercially available alternatives, especially where new cost or conversion cost is the same or less than for HFCs, industry does not take up HFCs. I don't think we should specify the alternatives; these are rapidly developing, but we should not let industry generate large sunk costs in technologies that are already superseded on environmental grounds, and often on economic and efficiency grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments Senator Chamarette will put before you are mainly designed to ensure that, in addressing one environmental woe, we do not make another problem worse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995 is a bill that the coalition will support. This bill does make amendments relating to the funding for the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. That funding is provided through the program to organisations and institutions to supplement the cost of delivering educational services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The main amendment proposes to increase the appropriation for the funding period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997 from $250,000 to $83.63 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals contained in the training or funding program are uncontroversial, but there is one aspect of Aboriginal education that I do want to draw some attention to. On 26 September last, Minister Crean announced a $200 million funding package for Aboriginal education over the next four years. That was a follow-up from a meeting of the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs at which state and territory ministers had agreed to endeavour to increase their financial effort over the period of the 1997-99 triennium. The Commonwealth agreed to provide additional strategic funding support in return for the states increasing their funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that Victoria strongly supported that proposal, the minister sought to criticise the Victorian government in articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspapers. Victoria does have a very impressive track record in terms of funding for Aboriginal education and, indeed, was more than happy to continue to provide an increase. It is a matter of some concern&mdash;or it should be&mdash;to all senators that Minister Crean's office or the Department of Employment, Education and Training sought to approach various other state offices indicating that Victoria was the only state that had not responded to the Commonwealth's request for additional funding. That was demonstrably untrue and, as it transpired, other states had received similar calls making the same allegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is worth while looking at what the Commonwealth has actually been trying to do. It is a classic example of playing politics to the hilt. There is an awareness on the part of this government in its last days that Queensland and New South Wales are very weak electorally for it and, as a result, the Commonwealth was proposing to change the rules for base Commonwealth funding in a way that would advantage Queensland and New South Wales and disadvantage the other states and territories. Indeed, it was also proposing to provide the states from 1997 with only 80 per cent of the 1995 funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of even the government realising that this was just too much to bear, that original proposal, as I understand it, has now been modified. But it just shows the treachery of the federal government in encouraging the states in good faith to agree to endeavour to increase their financial effort over the period on one set of rules, but then suddenly turning around and making a completely different set of proposals to the various states, which would disadvantage most of them. Of course, they then have the hide to publicly criticise those states for not going along with the Commonwealth government's blatantly political objectives. I am sure that the electorate will be aware of this government's appalling track record in terms of distorting the facts wherever possible, using all sorts of forums to criticise any Liberal government around the country and once again misusing funding for electoral purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal education is a critically important area. It ought to be an area in which there is a substantial degree of bipartisanship. It ought to be possible to honour agreements reached in good faith at ministerial council meetings, but that is virtually impossible when you have the Commonwealth government simply trying to rat on those deals and play politics to the hilt and, almost in the sports rorts manner, spread the money around to those areas where it feels it is electorally weakest. Given the shameful performance of this government in so many areas of Aboriginal improvement, it is a great shame that it has not been prepared to play this down the line to ensure that the states were prepared to, and are able to, work cooperatively with the Commonwealth. So I will leave the matter there, and I just hope that in due course the Commonwealth gets the rebuff that it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995 will continue to allow grants of financial assistance to the states and territories of Australia and other educational bodies to continue to further the cause of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education in this country. As we have been told, it allows for $83,636,000 to be the level of funding for the 1996 calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a decrease on last year's amount by $0.27 million, but I understand this is supposed to be an adjustment of the half-yearly effect of the transfer of funds from 1 July 1995. It allows for $0.54 million to go to the Department of Communications and the Arts for the 1995-96 year, which is a commitment from the Creative Nation statement. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said this at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indigenous Art forms must be protected and allowed to flourish. They need specific support from the Government which cannot be provided through the national training institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite this strong statement and despite this significant amount of money, I take this opportunity to point out that indigenous art forms don't just happen in the sort of institution that the government is funding with this latest amount. Indigenous art centres in some places in Australia are in chaos, and I have received representations from some organisations that are on the point of collapse. I know that the government, the opposition and the Greens in this chamber would all acknowledge the important role that such organisations play in remote and urban centres, but this year some of those groups have had their funding category changed because they are now considered to be income generating exercises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that in this new scheme, the community economic initiatives scheme, they had their processes changed this year and they would not approve money without further assessment in some cases. This means that no money went to the centre while the red tape was being sorted out, which meant conditions for workers were stressful and, in one case that we know of, they were unpaid. While we support the National Institute for Indigenous Performing Arts Training, we would ask the Prime Minister to take a look at the other forms of support to indigenous art, as he mentioned in his statement, and ensure that those things are running smoothly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, the Australian Democrats agree with this bill. We believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a unique place in our society which must be recognised. Indigenous peoples face many challenges in our society, not the least of which is dealing with the education system. As far as they are concerned, the retention rates are a scandal, and the latest figures show that participation levels are improving but there is still a wide gap between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I would like to include a short extract from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social justice for indigenous Australians 1994-95</EMPHASIS> to illustrate this point. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1985 and 1992, the retention rate to year 12 of Indigenous students rose from 14 per cent to 25%. Rates for other students in the same period, however, rose from 58% to 78%. In the 1991 Census 1 in 2 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 15-19 year olds stated they had left school at 16 or younger compared with 1 in 4 non indigenous people in this age group . . . The 1991 Census showed that among 20-24 year olds the proportion of indigenous people attending educational institutions was about one third of the non-indigenous rate.</PARA>
<PARA>In agreeing with this bill, the Australian Democrats are warning the government to use this significant amount of money to get it right for the future&mdash;to ensure that the retention rates go up to levels which the indigenous community finds acceptable and which give their community the reassurance that the Australian education system is as beneficial and accessible to them as it is to the rest of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to ask the government to take note that the Young Australian Democrats Convention just recently had two resolutions with respect to indigenous education issues. Firstly, they called on the government and the people of Australia to recognise concepts of land and place as integral to indigenous identity and spirituality and to respond appropriately to ensure the future of indigenous people. Secondly, they called for informed and constructive inclusion in any civics education program&mdash;such as the $24 million one the federal government is presently funding&mdash;of a program of Aboriginal and Islander history. These are both worthwhile objectives, and I would commend them to the government for inclusion in its policy formulation and implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one suggested amendment to this bill. It is an important amendment, and it occurs actually on the very first page; that is, to change the title of the act from Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995 to the Indigenous Education Supplementary Assistance Bill 1995. This follows a changing trend whereby there is a recognition of the difference of Torres Strait Islander people and an overt need for this recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government previously recognised this when they accepted the name change for the Indigenous Corporation (Land Fund) Act. Also, what is presently known as the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act will probably get a name change after the review to the Indigenous Councils and Associations Act. People such as the Prime Minister and Mr Mick Dodson use the term `indigenous' when discussing policy issues, so we believe this amendment has consistency with current perspectives. I would urge the other parties in the Senate to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear why we will be moving similar amendments to all relevant legislation. The government, in passing this bill, and the opposition, in supporting it, are perpetrating a sham on the parliament, the Australian people and the international community. The government is treading the world stage and pretending to be a good world citizen by signing and ratifying international treaties. But back at home there is no obligation to do anything about the commitments that those international treaties entail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those of you who are unfamiliar with what has occurred, the Teoh High Court decision was a landmark decision that allowed the international treaties which have been ratified and to which Australia is a signatory to have the normal expectation of anybody; that is, there would be a reasonable expectation when administrative decisions are made that the people making those decisions will take into consideration any obligations that were there under our international treaty obligations. They do not have to agree with them; they simply have to take them into consideration. If they do not take those matters into consideration, it provides a procedural right, not a substantive right, to an Australian citizen to challenge that administrative decision because it has failed to conform with Australia's known and recognised international treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are implications for every piece of legislation that has been passed in this place and every piece of government decision making that may occur afterwards. I believe that some members of both the major parties are unaware of what we have done, which is create unintended consequences. Substantially, we have given governments a licence to sign and ratify treaties on behalf of Australia with no intention in the world of creating any obligation back home. Until those treaties are enforced in domestic law, they are to have no obligations. If they are to have no obligations on administrators, why are we signing and ratifying them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace and it will show us up in the world community to be frauds. We are pretending to have high standards. We are using the international treaty system in a manipulative way to try to improve other nations' standards. We are opting out from any obligation within our country to abide by that until such time as the lowest common denominator can be introduced in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular treaty that is related to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995, which we are considering today, is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Australia is a party to that convention. This gives rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of anyone in Australia that, to the extent that this act does anything less than implement the requirements of that convention, it will be able to be procedurally addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment I have moved simply puts in place the position that upholds the High Court decision in Teoh. It is a slightly more conservative version of that decision, but one that upholds a legitimate expectation that our governments will be responsible and accountable for the international treaties and covenants to which they have become a party. It requires that they allow that convention to be honoured in the administrative decision making that occurs. If that does not occur explicitly, at least there will be protection so that a citizen who feels something has been done contrary to any of the requirements of the convention can at least be given an adequate opportunity to present a case against taking such a course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, they do not necessarily win on the basis of this amendment or the announced Teoh case position. They simply have a procedural right. We are removing that procedural right. We are giving unbridled power to bureaucrats and administrators to not be accountable to governments that have signed and ratified international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very disturbing aspect of the last month is that, through the committee stage, where the government's legislative response to the Teoh case has been given committee consideration, this matter has received no publicity whatsoever. There are people in the community who would not know that we are promoting a most retrograde and draconian step for Australian government and parliament. So that is why, on each occasion when the rights of people within Australia are being undermined by the potential of that anti-Teoh legislation, the Greens will be proposing amendments that simply maintain the status quo; that is, a legitimate  procedural right of an individual to challenge a decision where it is not in conformity with the international conventions with which it should be in conformity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court is affirming a long-held principle that a person has a legitimate expectation that their government will comply with the provisions of, in this case, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The High Court has reaffirmed that procedural right. The person who is affected by a decision which does not comply with the treaty will be notified and have the opportunity to respond. If the effect of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995, if it passes in the Senate, will be to negate our international treaty obligations as they relate to CERD&mdash;that is, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&mdash;and where these provisions in the amendment that I am putting are not enacted, we will have a very undesirable situation altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this amendment means. It is a simple amendment which puts in place a protection to ensure that Aboriginal people enjoy equality with other Australians in their access to education, in section 5; to ensure equity of participation by Aboriginals in education, in section 6; and to ensure equitable and appropriate educational outcomes for Aboriginal people, in section 7. We  must consider the Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in relation to decisions made under this bill. Support for this bill is one way of doing that, thus preventing the erosion of our rights which are so vital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment moved by Senator Chamarette has a lot of unforeseen consequences and, whilst nobody doubts the earnestness with which Senator Chamarette is pursuing this matter, I think it is important that the Senate examines the consequences of it and, more importantly, that the Senate examines the implications for constitutional law if Senator Chamarette's amendment is accepted. Senator Chamarette begins her argument on the premise that the executive is signing treaties and that, without this amendment, the Commonwealth of Australia is an international fraud because the executive signs treaties which do not have the force or effect of law or do not give rise to procedural rights within Australia itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself may well be a compelling argument in metaphysics, but the problem is that it is not a compelling argument in constitutional law. Let me explain why. It follows from what Senator Chamarette says that her amendment would give effect not merely to treaties which have been signed and ratified as at this date and at this point in time, but would also give affect to treaties which are signed after this point in time. This is very important because, theoretically, one could have cognisance of all of the treaties to which the Commonwealth of Australia is a signatory&mdash;I think it would be very difficult to have cognisance of all those treaties because I understand there are about 2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theoretically, it is possible for this Senate chamber to have cognisance of all those treaties at this point in time. But if this amendment is accepted, we must also accept that treaties signed after this date will give rise to procedural rights in favour of individuals merely by virtue of their having been signed and ratified by the Governor-General. If this was a bill that created a right for a minister to change the rights of individuals merely by regulation&mdash;in other words, a Henry VIII clause&mdash;I am sure that Senator Chamarette would be horrified by such a suggestion. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee would be horrified by the suggestion that here we were going to create a Henry VIII clause, giving ministers wide-ranging powers to alter or affect the rights of individuals merely by regulation. Of course, a regulation is a disallowable instrument and has to come before the Senate and the House of Representatives and can be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette through her amendment is creating a right in favour of the executive to alter or affect the rights of individuals by signing a treaty, yet that treaty is not even so much as a disallowable instrument, because neither house of parliament has the right to disallow the treaty. In other words, this amendment gives cart blanche to the executive to do whatever they want. We should always be wary of giving the executive cart blanche.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette in moving this amendment is no doubt motivated by a belief that it improves the rights of individuals. But in many cases treaties, because they create restrictions and obligations, can impair the rights of individuals. It would be wholly inappropriate for this parliament to support this amendment and create the possibility that a minister could sign a treaty, the Executive Council could recommend to the Governor-General that that treaty be ratified, and the rights of individuals could be impaired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a precedent that Senator Chamarette wishes to create. Senator Chamarette has told the chamber, in fact, that this is one of a number of amendments that she wishes to move to other items of government legislation as well to give effect to this broad principle. I say that this broad principle is wrong. It is wrong because of the unintended consequences it will have. But more important to honourable senators, this amendment is wrong in principle because it over-reaches the powers set out for the Commonwealth in section 51 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis on which the executive accedes to treaties has always been that it comes within the scope of the executive to deal with matters of external affairs. Senator Chamarette's amendment will import, at least into administrative law, the principles of international treaties without bringing legislation to the parliament. I must remind Senator Chamarette that the preamble to section 51 of the constitution reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it then itemises points (i) to (xxxix), and item (xxix) is external affairs. In other words, the parliament has the power to make laws with respect to the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in relation to external affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no power of the parliament to abrogate its rights to the executive to make laws which bind individuals and which are not subject to legislation, and this is what it would do. For that reason, Senator Chamarette's amendment would have thoroughly unintended and thoroughly unsatisfactory constitutional consequences in this nation. We would not know what we are importing into our domestic law if we voted for Senator Chamarette's amendment and we could never know what we imported into domestic law because it would be subject to whatever treaties a minister or the executive decided to sign and ratify, and that should be a cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in so far as base politics is concerned, can I say to the minor parties in this place that every time they accede to an increase in the power of the executive, to the ability of the executive to rule citizens without bringing legislation before this parliament, they weaken their own power and they weaken their own bargaining position. That, I think, from the point of view of Realpolitik, is a foolish thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that I have the gravest concerns and the greatest difficulty in supporting Senator Chamarette's amendment which she has brought before this place. I also accept the fact that Senator Sherry has made some very good points&mdash;I hate to say it, Senator Sherry&mdash;in relation to how these treaties could cut across the relationships between state and federal governments, because the federal government could impair the rights of states to legislate and could impair the operation of agreements which have been made between the state and federal governments to give effect to funding and other arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fine if we have a unitary system of government with no states to say that maybe we will have self-executing treaties, but I think the wiser heads in government, such as Senator Jones, recognise that whilst we have states they have legitimate powers, they have to be respected and, obviously, international treaties which override not just the states but their relationships with the federal government are unsatisfactory. That is another reason why I find grave difficulty accepting the proposition that Senator Chamarette has put. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment, in a very disciplined way, repeats the judgment of the High Court in Teoh's case. The High Court in Teoh's case did not address itself to the substance of the treaty that was the subject of the Teoh case&mdash;that was, the Convention on the Rights of the Child&mdash;but simply to the process that the decision maker had to follow in dealing with an application which related in its subject matter to what was being dealt with by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this amendment under subsection (a) very clearly says `an administrative decision'. Therefore, the decision maker is confined to considering the process in making a decision in the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment goes a step further and the amendment preserves the power of parliament by saying, `Unless and until any legislation is passed by parliament which contradicts the terms of this amendment.' So it is quite clear that the power of the executive is not enlarged to anything like the frightening spectre that Senator O'Chee has tried to conjure up. In fact, it is not enlarged at all, because we have had that practice for decades. There are many treaties and conventions entered into by executive government which never come before a parliament, but which are followed through executive action and direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here with a very limited approach which simply says that, if the executive government on behalf of Australia enters into a treaty and says to the whole world, `This is what we oblige ourselves to do on behalf of Australians', then to a very limited extent administrative decision makers need to at least consider what this treaty says when they are dealing with an application before them&mdash;and that is all. I think it is something we should follow and implement unless we want to have Australia stand before the world saying, `We will make treaties, but we will then disregard them.'

I am guided by Elizabeth Evatt, Justice Kirby and all the people who made submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Committee and with whom the committee members disagreed, in the face of all the community response and evidence that could be presented to them. I am not proclaiming my legal superiority over Senator O'Chee's; I am just relying on those of the experts who gave testimony to the Legal and Constitutional Committee and I am quite confident that the amendment I have put up does not have any of the unforeseen consequences that Senator O'Chee, in his dire and gloomy way, has predicted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start&mdash;and I thank Senator Spindler for that&mdash;it is a very specific amendment that relates only to one convention: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It does not create some kind of magical right on every treaty&mdash;not just every treaty that has already been signed and ratified by the government but every treaty that might ever be. It does not all. It simply relates it to one convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, it says, `Unless and until this section is expressly repealed;' that is, it provides to this parliament and this place the capacity to check whether that specific international treaty should give rise to any legitimate expectations. So it is a very conservative and constricted response to what the Teoh High Court decision established as an already existing principle, that is, that if we have governments signing and ratifying international treaties, it is a legitimate and reasonable expectation on the part of any citizen of Australia, when they hear about that, that administrative decisions will be in conformity with the convention that has been ratified by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the argument that this gives the executive government undue and open carte blanche in terms of treaties and creates a right for governments, I urge my opposition colleagues to be a little more sophisticated in their analysis of what the anti-Teoh legislation does, which is to do precisely that&mdash;to give executive government carte blanche, because the real motive of the anti-Teoh legislation is to codify what has been until now obviously unwritten government policy, that is, to cloak themselves in the mantle of international saintliness on human rights and on environmental issues by signing these treaties in the secure knowledge that nothing need be done about them back home. With a law that says there are no ramifications in Australia, the government may well see this as licence to sign. The coalition, who were concerned about the erosion of Australia's sovereignty under international treaties, should be extremely fearful of granting the government such a licence by supporting the anti-Teoh legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the first one to say&mdash;and I would agree with Senator O'Chee on this one point&mdash;that this is not a complete and obvious response to the problem that has been raised by the support of the Labor and Liberal coalition of the administrative bill that is going to be passed. We would much prefer a comprehensive approach to the implementation of our international obligations. It is long overdue. To try to alter that by the anti-Teoh legislation is a piecemeal, knee-jerk reaction to a very modest decision by the High Court, and what we are doing here with our small and simple amendment is simply protecting this one piece of legislation from the erosion that the bill will provide to it once that bill is passed. </PARA>

This document No. 1 deals with a bilateral treaty relating to air services with Bahrain&mdash;on the surface of it, a very technical treaty and one which would not attract much comment. However, when you look at this matter more thoroughly, you see that there are a number of treaties further on in the list, and also in that list at document 25, which deal with such matters as racial and sexual discrimination, climate change, nuclear energy, control of hazardous waste, industrial relations and the setting up of a United Nations criminal court, just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we have these 24 treaties listed on this paper, but at document 25 we have a list which sets out some 39 international instruments which are currently the subject of negotiation or review, a further 26 international treaties which have been finalised but which are also under review, and as well as that some 30 ILO conventions. All of this was tabled today in the Senate with some 16 other annual reports, and all I have timewise to speak today is some five minutes.

If this is what it calls `further initiatives', I think it is thoroughly inappropriate, it is a disgraceful state of affairs, and does not afford us, as representatives of the Australian people, any opportunity to go through these treaties and have any chance to be apprised of their content. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chamarette's comments show remarkably well our real dilemma. The senator wants to debate a number of treaties. She is quite entitled to debate a number of treaties, treaties which she feels are important to her and to her constituents. I would strongly support that position. But the reality is, as my colleague Senator Ellison has demonstrated to the chamber, you are not going to have that chance or opportunity because the standing orders limit this debate to half an hour. Each of us has five minutes. A number on this side of the parliament wish to jump. Senator Bell is in the chamber. He may wish to have a few remarks on some issues. So in regard to your right, Senator, to debate these important treaties, whereas one may say in theory that we can continue to put this on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, the reality is that the opportunity will not be available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate on the role of parliament and treaties has gone on for a number of years. I have detected on all sides of the chamber a consensus that something has to be done. The people who stand out from this process are essentially Senator Evans and his colleagues, who believe that the current processes are appropriate for this parliament. My view is that Senator Evans has comprehensively lost that debate. If the department believes that the current arrangements, where there is such a limited time for the parliament to play a role in this debate, should remain in force in the coming years I believe that is wrong. As I have talked around it, the Democrats wish to ensure through a private member's bill that parliament has a chance to veto the treaty. The Greens may not have moved that far but believe that there should be a greater role for parliament in the scrutiny of treaties. We have put down a number of important policies which we believe would increase the role of parliament to scrutinise treaties and to more effectively involve our people and the people of Australia in the treaty making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All governments will sign treaties across a whole range of areas, but there is a consensus emerging that we should more effectively involve the parliament. Some people would involve the parliament to the extent that required legislative approval or veto of a treaty which did not have the support of the parliament. Most have not moved that far but everyone, with some exceptions in the Labor Party, believes that there should be a more effective way to scrutinise contentious treaties so that the parliament and, through the parliament, the people of Australia can be more effectively involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department, in discussions with them over quite a long period, have not grasped the nettle on this important issue. They seem to think that Australia, unlike most other countries, should not have an effective role for the parliament in the treaty making process. A number of studies have been done which show that most countries, most democracies, more effectively involve their parliaments in some way in the treaty making processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate today the issue of treaties came up and the importance of an international treaty. In a society where the rule of law is writ large like our own there is no question that an international treaty is an important instrument and can have important domestic effects.

For example, we were told that one particular suspect in the Operation Wallah inquiry had been interviewed. It transpired that, instead of this particular suspect being brought in and being made to undergo a proper interview, because of this person's particular links, I assume to the government, it was thought appropriate that an officer telephone this suspect's lawyer to ask whether the lawyer believed that the suspect was guilty of an offence.

Two of these references resulted in the delaying of serious criminal charges against two AFP investigators&mdash;and you thumb to page 54 to find this out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the AFP is in turmoil. I acknowledge the point made by the commissioner recently that the restructuring in the AFP has had no relationship to the extraordinarily unfortunate volume of corruption that has become evident in the ICAC inquiries in New South Wales and that these are merely coincidental. The fact remains that this report does not give any kind of impression of the sorts of problems the Australian Federal Police is going through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst feature of this is that the great bulk of AFP officers are honest, hard working, effective and competent. It is unfortunate that there does seem to have been a politicising of an element of the AFP and the corrupting of another element of the AFP. The politicising is evidenced from the complaints that Senator Chapman has made where there was a clear and disgraceful attempt, successful attempt so far&mdash;</PARA>

Those who have come clean so far include high ranking officers, one posted overseas. The AFP says all of these confessors, code named to protect their lives, have tended their resignations and some of them have been given indemnity from prosecution. When did all this happen?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a matter that is of great concern out in the community&mdash;that is, the way in which the roll out of the information superhighway and the communications revolution that is sweeping this country has some rather unfortunate side effects. The particular side effect I want to refer to tonight is the way in which mobile communication towers are springing up across the landscape with very little regulation from government. The whole matter goes back to the way in which this government, yet again, has mucked up the legislative and regulatory environment for this new development in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things that are happening and causing great concern to the community include a child-care centre in the seat of Warringah in Sydney where they decided to put the tower up right next to a child-care centre. The radiation from these towers is a matter of great concern. Also in the same area of Sydney there were people who bought a home, spent a lot of money buying the home, then spent a lot of money renovating the home; now one of the communication carriers has built a huge tower right next door to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate to consider what the effects of that would be on the property value of that particular home and other homes nearby. What recourse do these people have in law? What possible negotiation rights do they have with the communication carriers? Under the law, the way this federal Labor government has set it up, they have no rights at all. It just continues a pattern we have seen with this government over many areas of legislation in the communications area in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have as Minister for Communications and the Arts, the Rip Van Winkle, Michael Lee, who on this issue, along with a number of others, has just left things to happen without a proper environment that protects the interests of the community. We had, for example, that terrible case last year with the anti-siphoning list on pay TV where it looked like people would not be able to watch the West Indies cricket tour because the minister did not get the list right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the case with the Spectrum Management Agency, which is controlling the distribution of licences for community broadcasting, leaving a whole range of community broadcasters out in the cold with nowhere to go because it will take them several years to set up and hold the inquiry in their area. We have pay television developing very rapidly into a duopoly in this country. We have the ABC cut out of it. Why? Again, because the regulatory framework was not set up properly by this government. They just did not think ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have the burgeoning mobile telephone market and the unfortunate consequences of visual pollution across the landscape of our big cities and out into country areas. This problem is going to become an increasing problem in our society unless the government does something about it. At this time, we have over two million mobile telephone subscribers&mdash;one in 10 Australians use a mobile telephone. That increase, particularly as we move from analog to digital, is going to be at an even more rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of you who use mobiles realise that they quite frequently drop out. That is because there are not enough centres to pick up the signals. So the urgency is always on for the communication carriers to throw up more and more towers. There is a need for more towers. The communications structure of this nation makes the need for this very great. But that national need has to be balanced off against the individual need in local communities where they do not want these ugly towers just thrown up without any regard to what the local communities think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem goes back to the way in which the government originally set up this legislation. What they did under the communications act in 1992 was exempt carriers from the normal local and state government environmental regulations. There was only a requirement that they consult in the local area and that was not clearly set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister indicated that this problem would be solved when they got to the point of laying out the code of practice under which the regulations were to operate. When that code came down, what we had was more or less a toothless tiger. We had communities coming to us as long as two years ago telling us about this problem and how the consultation process and code was not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was happening in places like Waterfall, which is on the south side of Sydney, was that they were putting up very ugly towers close to residential areas. The local residents complained to Telstra when it had a community meeting, the local council complained to Telstra and then Telstra went ahead and did what it wanted to do. It can do that because it has this exemption. Because the government has not given a body such as Austel the power to act as an honest broker in this matter we find our communication companies can do what they like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we suggest should happen is that the government give a body like Austel greater teeth to act as the regulator to  balance the national interest versus the interests of the local community and to work out some orderly process whereby the community could feed into the decision making process. It is not happening now. The interests of families and residents have been totally ignored. There are a lot of very upset people as a result of these towers that are going up everywhere. We need to develop a code with real teeth so that communities can have a say on what happens in their areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise an extraordinary situation, which was reported in the media, relating to the repayment by the Australian Workers Union&mdash;the largest union affiliated with the ALP&mdash;of donations totalling $150,000 to five organisations that made those donations in August this year. The repayment, which is no doubt extraordinary, is even more extraordinary when you consider the people to whom these repayments of donations were made. For example, more than $100,000 of the $150,000 in donations was from the legal firm Phillips Fox and the construction company John Holland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Phillips Fox received back its $58,000 donation to the AWU and John Holland, which is under the control of Mrs Holmes a Court, received back its $43,000 donation. I am intrigued about the Phillips Fox payment because Mick Young, a former minister in a Labor government, is a consultant to Phillips Fox and is described as a very effective communicator with the government. They say that they have a team of experts who know the correct path to follow in order to achieve optimum results for their clients. They say that they work well with Australia's political decision makers, ministers, their policy advisers and the appropriate bureaucrats at all levels. That raises an interesting question about the purpose of their $58,000 donation to the AWU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose you could say the same about John Holland Construction. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that Mrs Holmes a Court is not held at a distance by the leadership of the Labor Party. There are other people who made smaller donations. The fact is that the companies initially paid the money to AWU national construction branch officials who created a slush fund to campaign, according to a media report, for re-election in union ballots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question in my mind is whether this was the real destination for this money. It seems extraordinary that these funds would go to supporting a factional fight within the AWU, although it is noteworthy that the factional fights within the AWU are fairly exciting. One would be surprised if companies of the status of John Holland and Phillips Fox would contribute $100,000 between them to support a particular faction within the AWU, although the bitterness in this dispute was severe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the propaganda put during the last AWU election one of the sides said, `We have had enough of the political interference in our union, enough of union officials who sit at their desks awaiting the ultimate superannuation and retirement fund&mdash;a seat in the Senate.' I do not know what Senator Forshaw, a former official of the AWU, thinks about that. He may have a different view altogether. There is no doubt that there is severe bitterness involved in the AWU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it would be extraordinary if these donations were for internal campaign purposes within the AWU, particularly as Mr Mick Young was selected as the person to inquire into and report on Labor's disastrous showing in the recent Queensland state election. Obviously one would assume that members of the other factions would not have been too cheerful about that if he had been involved in donations to a particular faction of the AWU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the serious question of whether this money was a donation to the Australian Labor Party, made via the AWU, its biggest single union member, to circumvent the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. Because there is no explanation given for these repayments, I wonder whether it is a recognition that the disclosure provisions would have got them in the end if these repayments were not made. There is no doubt that there is a clear need for this matter to be cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For whom was Phillips Fox's $58,000 donation intended? For whom was John Holland's $43,000 donation intended? One wonders whether any of these bodies have matters before the AWU or the federal or Queensland parliaments where they are representing someone or seeking to gain contracts. This kind of donation would not have come to light through the normal reporting process of the Electoral Act and that is a concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want any details of it, the questions relate to a company called Chamber Consulting Services Pty Ltd, which is the major shareholder in PSI Superannuation Management Pty Ltd which administers the AWU superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that Chamber Consulting had been paid $6,400 from the Victorian AWU account on 18 August this year. This account and other AWU accounts in Victoria have been under investigation by police since Mr Cambridge lodged complaints with the National Crime Authority. The NCA referred the matter to the Victorian police after AWU's senior officials had been able to account for about $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bank document leaked to the media some time ago suggests much of the money could have been returned to a number of large companies; but the document alone does not explain the relationship between signatories to the account and the companies involved. The companies initially paid the money to AWU national construction branch officials who created a slush fund to campaign for re-election in union ballots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies paid money from the AWU members welfare association No. 1 account on 18 August were: Chamber Consulting, $6,400; John Holland, $43,000; Thiess Brothers, $9,400; Phillips Fox, $58,000; and Fluor Daniel, $29,000. It would be interesting to know what that is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conflict within the AWU is very severe. In one document I have from one of the AWU factions, there is an attack on Mr Bob Smith, who it is alleged appears to have been incompetent or worse; the financial reserves of the union were exhausted in an extravagant spending spree; for no good reason the union shifted its Melbourne office one block and took the vehicle builders' office off their hands; a massive mortgage is still `hanging over our heads'; in May 1992, Smith ordered wide-scale sackings and cutbacks but branch president, Fred Phillips, resisted and went to the Victorian police; fraud and corruption investigations began against Smith and, not unnaturally, Smith disappeared on paid leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal president, Bill Ludwig, and federal secretary, Mike Forshaw, put the situation under wraps.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in the adjournment debate on matters arising out of a particularly silly speech made by Mr Michael Lee in the House of Representatives last night when he rushed breathlessly into the chamber and extended the debate after 8.00 to respond to some remarks by my colleague Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Abbott's concerns were principally twofold: the erection of mobile digital telephone towers relating to telephony; and the stringing of cables overground but beneath power cables in respect of pay television and broadband services, fibre-optic cable. They are both quite separate issues; both of them, however, do have significant environmental and town planning implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Abbott was quite rightly drawing the concern of the House of Representatives to the appalling neglect of this government via Mr Lee's callous indifference to the rights of citizens by his refusal to upgrade the telecommunications code, which has now been in place for many months and which he was forced to review only as a result of a deal he brokered with the Australian Democrats to avoid a disallowance of the code by the opposition in the Senate to tighten it up and to ensure much greater power was handed back to the local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Mr Lee is still vigorously resisting any suggestion that the locals ought to have a greater control over events in their own areas. As a result, the Senate has now required the minister representing him in this chamber to make a statement tomorrow morning explaining why there has been such inordinate delay in conducting the government's own review, which started on 1 July, and to inform the Senate of the government's intentions in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all matters of proper community concern. There is a balance to be struck. Clearly, it is necessary for the mobile phone network to be seamless, not to have black holes and blackouts. But, at the same time, you cannot simply impose it on the citizenry. You cannot simply put it up irrespective of the consequences both aesthetic and environmental. Yet this government seems to have no understanding of those sensitivities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee's speech revealed not a skerrick of insight into those concerns, but simply got the issues fundamentally wrong. For example, he seems to not even understand the difference between conduits and cables. He rabbited on at some length about how the Telecommunications Act allows Optus to get access to the cables. But Mr Abbott's point, as I understand it, was to inquire why it was not possible for the conduits to be shared so that underground you had simply the one duct but two separate sets of fibre-optic cables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee does not even seem to understand that that is the area of concern, let alone try to address it. Telstra argues that, indeed, there is insufficient room in a 30-centimetre diameter conduit and, therefore, it is not possible to accommodate the Optus cable. Therefore, there is a requirement for Optus to lay its own and because it is significantly cheaper and faster, and indeed because the licence is granted to the carriers requiring them to roll out the cable as quickly as possible, understandably, they have taken another course. Indeed, there are certainly suggestions that Telstra has the same proposals in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Mr Lee seems to be utterly oblivious to the distinction, or else simply utterly unconcerned about residents' anxieties. That is what I find so distressing. I know he is out of his depth and I know that in many respects he simply has to take his orders from his master's voice. But you would have thought that he would at least understand that he does not need to use the term `Telecom' anymore because there is no such entity. You would have thought he would realise that Bob Mansfield is no longer the executive director of Optus Communications. But here he is still using outdated terminology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I even understand he was so childish and petty as to go down to the National Library this morning following on someone who had introduced Brendan Smyth and then to refer to him as `Mr Smythe'. I do not know whether that is done deliberately. It sounds like the tactics of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to try to denigrate, humiliate and embarrass all those who do not belong to his party. But I would have thought that is childish behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I saw a press release put out tonight by Mr Lee, which suggests that somehow Mr Abbott had been in the House of Representatives last night proposing a break-up of Telstra, it immediately dawned on me why he had put this release out. It was to disguise the fact that he himself had fundamentally misunderstood these points of concern&mdash;that, in fact, the government itself is the party that has constantly proposed the break-up of Telstra. Mr Lee moved amendments at the national conference to preserve only the core activities to deliberately allow the possibility of selling off so-called non-core assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Mr Beddall who went to the Telstra board when he was the Minister for Communications and the Arts proposing that they sell off non-core assets. It was the Prime Minister who put up the proposition to Mr Frank Blunt only a matter of months ago that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> be sold off and then, of course, forced Mr Blunt to buy his way out of the blackmail by surrendering a huge and totally unwarranted dividend payment to the government, which treats Telstra as a cash cow and not as a means of providing high quality telecommunications services to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it is quite clear that if Mr Lee is going to have any contribution to make in this debate, he has to come to terms with the concepts involved. He ought to start by going back into the chamber in the adjournment debate and apologising to Mr Abbott, because Mr Abbott said nothing more than, `Perhaps we need to go further. Perhaps we need to break up Telstra', et cetera. In other words, using hypothetical propositions to indicate his personal view, in no shape or form ever diverged from the coalition's oft-stated policy of privatisation on a going concern basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Labor Party that has been interested in asset stripping. That is precisely what Mr Lee is trying to distract attention from. That is why it is so disappointing when you get him saying things like, `It was the coalition which helped to vote to ensure that the telephone companies were exempted from the state planning laws.' The fact is that we supported legislation which gave the minister a discretion&mdash;which we expected him to exercise properly&mdash;to bring in a code that would have struck a proper balance, not simply allowed for a notification to councils but no obligation to go any further and to allow towers to be erected overnight, without proper consultation, quite often in unsatisfactory locations and without any attempt to pursue proper collocation options. That has come about as a result of pressure applied by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still argue vehemently that that code is inadequate. We have made it perfectly clear that we think there ought to be much more consultation. There has been deafening silence on the part of the government. It is quite clear that not only has Mr Lee ratted on the clear obligation imposed upon him as minister to come up with a code that would provide a proper balance and that would ensure that residents' concerns were taken into conduct, instead we get all this silly nonsense like:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do not know if your constituents would be happy if they missed out on the lower prices that flow, especially for local calls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one is talking about preventing the roll out. The issue is the terms upon which the carriers and their associates can exercise their rights to roll out cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee does not even seem to understand the issue in terms of duplication. Mr Abbott was pointing to the fact that this government had a number of options when it first confronted the issues of rolling out the cable for pay television and broadband interactive services. They could have actually had exclusive regional franchises requiring only one carrier to roll out a cable in a particular area, but on a common carrier basis so that they had to give access to others. They could also have allowed the duplicate roll out but, at the same time, required them to be common carriers so that they would have access to each other's services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They could have had a utility arrangement and drawn that distinction between carriage and content, which other countries have done, but we let the whole game go by default. Mr Lee came up with a model which is unique. As a result, we will see some $3 billion to $4 billion of unnecessary duplication in this country. He seems to be utterly oblivious to all these concerns. You can have duplication and you can have parallel cables inside the same conduit. But he seems to think there is no difference between cables and conduits. If that is the level of his ignorance, I very much hope that he will go away and do his homework before he comes back into the House of Representatives and apologises for all that silly nonsense of last night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I attended the release of the Dorset municipality's draft sustainable development strategy. For the information of honourable senators, the municipality of Dorset is situated in north-eastern Tasmania. I know Senator Watson knows well where it is but, for the information of other senators, the municipality of Dorset comprises 3,196 square kilometres; it has a permanent population of 7,690 people; and it encompasses the townships of Bridport, Branxholm, Derby, Gladstone, Legerwood, Nabowla, Musselroe Bay, Pioneer, Ringarooma, Scottsdale, Tomahawk and Winnaleah.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not wish to claim any credit for the content of the draft sustainable development strategy. I was invited to that release because I had sponsored a forum on sustainable development which provided input to the council's strategy development. The forum that I sponsored was designed to encourage the community to approach resource problems from the perspective that the Dorset municipality could be viewed as a totality with resource usage linked to many activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It was problems associated with resource management which sparked the need to encourage a wider perspective to issues. Tasmanian senators will, I am sure, remember a pyrethrum manufacturer who was responsible for a spill of pyrethrum into the Great Forester River near Scottsdale about 18 months ago. Following that episode, Atrazine was detected in creek water in the district. This was of particular concern to local hop growers and milk producers who were economically dependent on access to pure water. It was found that the contamination of water supplies resulted from the application of Atrazine to retard weed growth in Tasmanian Forestry Corporation plantations. Neither was this problem confined to north-east Tasmania; it was also an issue at Wynyard, Lorinna and other places in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although the Dorset Council called for a moratorium on the use of Atrazine, it was clear that a long-term strategy on resource usage was required because, as well as the chemical issue, there was considerable concern about the adequacy of road funding in the municipality as a result of wear and tear from log trucks. I presented petitions and encouraged people to nominate Atrazine as a chemical to be reviewed by the National Registration Authority. As a result, the National Registration Authority came to Launceston and held its largest public consultation meeting of the review process. Eventually, Atrazine was selected as one of the 10 chemicals to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also initiated the preparation of a community forum in order to broaden perspectives about resource usage in the municipality. The forum was held in December 1994 and included speakers on ecological sustainable development, alternative agriculture, ecological forestry, wine producing and pyrethrum manufacturing. The forum ended with a dinner with Professor Ben Sellinger as the guest speaker. The event was well attended and produced a report which was submitted to the Dorset Council's own strategy development meetings. I am pleased to note that many of the issues raised at that forum are incorporated into the council's final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report identifies seven major issues, of which water quality and resource, and land use head the list. With National Water Week being held next week, it is timely to acknowledge that water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. Australia's&mdash;and Tasmania's&mdash;rivers, lakes, streams and underground supplies are under massive threat from the effects of sewerage, industrial waste, siltation from bare paddocks, fertiliser and chemical run-off from agriculture, forestry and mining. In Tasmania, the Dorset municipality is now leading the way in recognising the need for integrated catchment management, measuring and monitoring water quality and identifying the sources of pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is also pleasing to see that, under the heading of land use, the report identified a desire to facilitate and support the introduction of alternative agricultural practices. It also identified the need to prepare a Dorset sustainable forest industry plan and to initiate a study of the costs and benefits of the forest industry to the community, including the costs of road maintenance. These are important issues which reflect the concerns of the municipality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the report recognises the integrated nature of the issues, and the need to be developing strategies for the region which integrate economic considerations and environmental and social consequences. I believe that this is a real step forward. The municipality now has the opportunity to work at implementing measures which could address significant problems in a manner that minimises the adverse or unforeseen consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without intending to dictate the direction the municipality should adopt, I note the opportunity to embrace alternative sustainable agricultural systems. There is a strong body of opinion which regards Tasmania's north-east as ideally suited for organic farming. The report provides a golden opportunity to adopt such a strategy. I would encourage those involved in organic or biological farming to take the opportunity provided by the implementation process to seriously encourage the community to investigate the scope and extent of the commercial opportunities available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, I would like to congratulate the Dorset Council on the draft strategy produced. I look forward to its implementation in the period ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this adjournment debate to put you, Mr President, and also the Senate on notice of the enforcement of order 34 of the Senate. Order 34 of the Senate entitled `Taxation bills&mdash;retrospectivity' reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, where the Government has announced, by press release, its intention to introduce a Bill to amend taxation law, and that Bill has not been introduced into the Parliament or made available by way of publication of a draft Bill within 6 calendar months after the date of that announcement, the Senate shall, subject to any further resolution, amend the Bill to provide that the commencement date of the Bill shall be a date that is no earlier than either the date of introduction of the Bill into the Parliament or the date of publication of the draft Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>In the budget announcement on 9 May, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced, as part of the budget, the decision to change the taxation treatment applicable to a debtor who is released from the liability to repay a commercial debt. Budget paper No. 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a commercial debt is forgiven after 7.30 pm EST 9 May 1995, the amount forgiven will reduce the debtor's future tax deductions by reducing in order the following amounts: prior revenue losses, prior net capital losses, undeducted balances of capital expenditures, and cost bases of capital assets. This measure will protect the revenue base by ensuring that where a debtors economic loss is transferred to the creditor through debt forgiveness, the associated future tax deductions are denied to the debtor. Creditors will continue to have access to the existing provisions relating to deductions for bad debts and capital losses.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that, at present, no bill for this proposed measure has actually been introduced into the parliament, nor has a draft bill even been published. So, I suppose, essentially the matter is in the hands of the Senate and, being in the hands of the Senate, it is also in your hands, Mr President. If, after 9 November 1995, a bill for the measure is introduced into the parliament or an appropriate draft bill is published, I believe there is an obligation on you and the Senate under this taxation bills retrospectivity order&mdash;resolutions expressing opinions of continuing effect&mdash;that was brought in on 8 November 1988, that that should be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the purpose of my contribution tonight is to put you on notice, Mr President, that you need to consider how you and the Senate propose to deal with a delinquent government and its failure to bring forward bills at the appropriate time and before the six months has expired. I thank the Senate. Mr President, you might be able to respond in the interim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with the following information in response to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In March 1994 an initial investigation was undertaken by Ernst and Young, Chartered Accountants, into Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) funding. The investigation revealed a number of problems with internal controls and administrative systems in the Yangennanock Aboriginal Corporation (YAC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) regards the report itself, including its detailed findings, as an internal document and it is therefore not publicly available.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Hamilton Aboriginal Community Justice Panel (HACJP) was suspended due to financial accountability problems regarding operating funds released to it by the Victoria Police.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inquiries made by ATSIC's Victorian Office have confirmed that the Victoria Police remain committed to the Aboriginal Community Justice Panel concept. Alternatives to the Hamilton Panel have been examined, and a revamped Panel is to be commenced soon based in the Heywood/Portland area. It is intended that this Panel will service Hamilton as well. This new Panel has the support of the Victoria Police and the State wide Aboriginal Community Justice Panels Chairpersons' group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Darlot River Housing Co-op is not known to ATSIC. However, the Darlots Creek (Saunders Family) Aboriginal Corporation is registered under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976. The Corporation was first registered in 1985. It is in the process of being deregistered by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations due to non compliance with its statutory responsibilities under the Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Subsection 164(7) of the Customs Act 1901 defines "mining operations" as, among other things, "mining for minerals". Under the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995, "minerals" is in turn defined to mean "minerals in any form, whether solid, liquid or gaseous and whether organic or inorganic, except sand, sandstone, soil, slate, clay (other than bentonite or kaolin), basalt, granite, gravel, limestone or water".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The word "for" in the expression "mining for minerals" requires that a purposive test be applied in that a claimant needs to demonstrate that the purpose of his or her activities is to obtain a particular mineral or minerals intermixed or embedded in the ore body that is extracted. As limestone is specifically excluded from the definition, a claimant is unable to enjoy the benefit of diesel fuel rebate if the activities carried out are characterised merely as the extraction of limestone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the purpose of the activity is to recover from an ore a particular mineral or minerals that conform to and are not excluded by the definition, rebate will continue to be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The eligibility test in the legislation is not whether the limestone is used for its chemical and mineral qualities, as limestone per se is not recognised as a mineral. Rather, eligibility for rebate is dependent on passing the purposive test referred to in (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Please refer to (1) and (2) above. The use of the limestone is irrelevant as it is excluded from the definition of minerals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As pointed out above, under the existing statutory definition, limestone is not recognised as </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a mineral. Regardless of whether the limestone is used in the deacidification of soil and water, in road making, construction or other purposes, if it is limestone, then it is excluded from the definition of "minerals" for the purposes of the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Australian Customs Service does not keep statistics of this nature. However, according to the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation, around 500,000 tonnes was applied to agricultural areas in Australia during 1989-90. </PARA>
