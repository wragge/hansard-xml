<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6 February 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to amendments to the AUSTUDY Regulations, being Statutory Rules No 409 of 1994. The amending regulations were considered by the Committee at its meeting on 2 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amending regulation 36.2 adds subregulations (4)-(6) to regulation 108. These amendments confer important discretions on the Secretary to suspend and recommence the payment of benefits. The subregulations also omit the Note to regulation 108, which advised of a right of appeal to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elsewhere, the amending Regulations confer the review functions of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Committee would appreciate your confirmation that regulation 108 decisions by the Secretary will be reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your advice would also be appreciated on what appear to be some minor drafting errors. Subregulation 14.3 omits subparagraph (ii) from regulation 63(1)(a). Subregulation 14.4 then adds new subparagraphs (iii) and (iv). The provision now seems to run from subparagraph (i) to subparagraph (iii). The Committee is concerned that a new subregulation (ii) may have been omitted inadvertently. Your advice on this matter would be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Note to amending regulation 40 states that the Note after Schedule 5 is to be taken to be a Note to Schedule 2. As far as the Committee is aware, there is no Note to Schedule 5, however the Note to Schedule 6 seems to be relevant. Your confirmation that this is the Note to which the amendment is intended to refer would also be appreciated.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 6 February 1995 concerning the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules No 409 of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 108</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You express concern that amending regulation 36.2, which adds sub regulations (4)-(6) to regulation 108, has omitted the Note which advised of a right of appeal to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal (SART). Since the amending regulations confer these review functions elsewhere you have requested confirmation that regulation 108 decisions by the Secretary will be reviewable by the Society Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that the decision to suspend or recommence payments under regulation 108 is reviewable under Part 9 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Both internal review and external review are provided through the SSAT and then the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There does not appear to be any reason in this case as to why the Note was left out, although the drafter may have been concerned to remove erroneous references to the SART.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sub regulation 14.3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have requested advice as to whether the omission here was inadvertent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training have advised me that this was a minor drafting oversight. The intention of the amendment was to remove an out of date reference to the Social Security Act 1947, which has been replaced by the Social Security Act 1991. I understand that the new numbering should have been adjusted to (ii) and (iii), rather than (iii) and (iv). However, there are no legal consequences flowing from this and the matter will be addressed in future amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note to Schedule 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amending regulation 40 omits Schedules 4 and 5 which relate to the SART and refer to regulation 103 and 104 respectively. The regulation further seeks to amend the Note after Schedule 5 and states that `the Note after Schedule 5 ("NOTE&mdash;Higher education institutions" is to be taken to be a Note to Schedule 2.)'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You indicate that there does not appear to be a Note after Schedule 5, however comment that the Note to Schedule 6 seems relevant and query whether this is the Note to which the amendment intended to refer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, I note that in the last official reprinting of the AUSTUDY regulations, two Notes were grouped at the end of the document after Schedules 1-5. The first note listed the Higher Education Institutions. It further provided a definition for `Higher Education Institution' as given by subregulation 33(3). It is this note to which the amendment refers. (The second note outlines the table of amendments to the AUSTUDY regulations).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for the proposed amendment to the note linking it with Schedule 2 was due to the common reference to regulation 33. Schedule 2 relates to TAFE Institutions and also refers to regulation 33. For clarity the note should have followed directly after this Schedule. When Schedules 4-5 were removed, it was considered appropriate to re-establish the link between the Note and Schedule 2. Amending regulation 40 was intended to achieve this and thereby avoid any confusion over a possible link between this Note and Schedule 5.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the above comments address your concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Civil Aviation Orders Part 105 AD/F27/103 Amdt 6 which amend the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives for Fokker F27 Series Aeroplanes. This Directive requires compliance with retirement lives, inspection methods, inspection periods and modifications specified in Fokker Structural Integrity Program (SIP) Document 27438 Revision 11 and subsequent Temporary Revisions (emphasis added).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its 1993-94 Annual Report (at paragraph 3.3), this Committee expressed a preferred view of the operation of section 49A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act</EMPHASIS>, which enables a regulation to incorporate matter contained in a non-statutory instrument only as that instrument is in force at the time the regulation takes effect. This would seem to prevent the incorporation of "subsequent Temporary Revisions" in the Directive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee understands that section 98(3A) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Civil Aviation Act 1988</EMPHASIS> enables regulations made under that Act to incorporate other written instruments as in force not only at the time the regulation takes effect, but as in force from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would, however, appreciate your advice as to the effect of section 49A on instruments such as Airworthiness Directives, which are not strictly regulations, but are made by virtue of the regulations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">re: Civil Aviation Orders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 6 March 1995 to my Minister concerning Civil Aviation Order (CAO) Part 105 AD/F27/103, Amdt 6.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked if this amendment to the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives for Fokker F27 Series aeroplanes is authorised under Section 98(3A) of the Civil Aviation Act in light of your Committee's view that the operation of Section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act makes no provision for a regulation to incorporate written instruments that may come into force after the time the regulation takes effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been informed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that Section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 does apply to Airworthiness Directives and that Section 98(3A) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (which excludes the operation of Section 49A in relation to Civil Aviation Regulations) does not extend to Civil Aviation Orders. Accordingly, Civil Aviation Orders cannot incorporate documents as in force from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been advised that the CAA has always operated on the understanding that CAOs cannot incorporate documents as in force from time to time. The reference to `subsequent Temporary Revisions' in CAO Part 105 AD/F27/103, Amdt 6 was made in error and will be corrected when Amendment List 6/95 is issued on 25 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank you for bringing this matter to my notice and to the notice of the CAA.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Civil Aviation Orders dated 19 January 1995 which make a number of amendments to section 40.1.0 of the Orders in relation to aircraft endorsements. These Orders were considered by the Committee at its meeting on 2 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a number of cases these amendments confer discretions on the Authority. For example, an amendment to subparagraph 6.1(c) proposes to replace the objective phrase "overseas aeroplane type endorsement that" with the subjective phrase "overseas aeroplane endorsement that the Authority is satisfied".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These discretions may be of considerable commercial value. The Committee would appreciate your confirmation that their exercise will be subject to some form of independent review.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">re: Civil Aviation Orders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 6 March 1995 to my Minister concerning amendments to Section 40.1.0 of the Civil Aviation Orders made on 19 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked whether the discretions conferred on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by the amendments to section 40.1.0 are subject to independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of section 40.1.0 set out the requirements that an applicant for an endorsement must meet before the CAA is permitted under subregulation 5.23 (2) of the Civil Aviation Regulations (the Regulations) to issue an endorsement to the applicant. The Order sets out alternative requirements to be met for each endorsement. One of the alternatives is that the applicant holds an overseas aeroplane endorsement that the CAA is satisfied is at least equivalent to the endorsement sought. If the applicant does not meet any of the alternative requirements, and the CAA is not satisfied that his or her overseas endorsement is at least equivalent to the endorsement sought, it must not issue the endorsement (refer subregulation 5.23 (3)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been advised that, under regulation 297A, any decision by the Authority not to issue an endorsement is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This allows for a review of the discretion that has been exercised where the CAA's reason for refusing to issue the endorsement is that it is not satisfied that the applicant's overseas endorsement is equivalent to the Australian endorsement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome this opportunity to table the 336th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. At the outset, I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their sterling efforts in support of this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background to the Inquiry</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is the result of the committee's inquiry into the commercialisation of public sector operations, which began nearly two years ago. In setting up the inquiry the committee was responding to concerns at that time about the operation of certain government business enterprises, GBEs, particularly the monopoly businesses of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. The committee was also aware of a series of reports by the Auditor-General about difficulties with the introduction of commercialisation in departments of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee decided to limit its inquiry to examining commercialisation in GBEs and business units in departments of state, and to focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of commercialisation and corporatisation, particularly in the FAC, the CAA and the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Efficiency and effectiveness, and the framework for commercialisation and corporatisation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took evidence from 14 of the Commonwealth's 19 GBEs and five of the nine departments which have business units. We concluded that commercialisation and corporatisation have been successful in increasing the efficiency with which GBEs and business units deliver goods and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness reflects the fact that, generally speaking, appropriate frameworks for commercialisation and corporatisation have been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The framework that has been established for the operation and oversight of GBEs has proved functional, and was finetuned with the issue of new guidelines in 1993. The oversight arrangements will be locked in and extended to cover government companies as well as GBEs with the passage, hopefully within the next month or so, of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you may recall, Madam Deputy President, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has played a central role in the development of this legislation, first recommending that it be prepared in 1989 and then considering the bill in detail in report No. 331, which was tabled in September last year. In contrast to GBEs, business units in departments of state are more recent creations and the framework for their operation is less well established and is still being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the Department of Finance should be taking a more prominent role than it has up to now in assisting departments to set up their business units. It should be putting more effort into monitoring the problems that arise in the course of commercialisation and identifying and disseminating best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also noted that business units in departments of state are currently disadvantaged by the requirements that being part of a department of state imposes. Given that corporatisation provides increased flexibility of operation, the committee has recommended that corporatisation should be extended to successful business units. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Key issues in commercialisation and corporatisation in the Commonwealth public sector</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee examined many aspects of the operation of GBEs and business units&mdash;more than I can cover now. I have therefore selected three topics of importance on which I wish to concentrate&mdash;they are: Firstly, safeguarding the public interest functions that were once required of what are now government businesses; secondly, the need for GBEs and business units to have clearly defined, non-conflicting, commercial objectives; thirdly, whether the arrangements for ministerial oversight of government businesses are fully appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In choosing to concentrate on these topics, I do not wish to give the impression that other matters were not considered. The committee's report also covers, for example, the accountability and financial regimes that apply to GBEs and business units, their performance in competing with the private sector, and the impact that commercialisation has had on staff. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The public interest: community service obligations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the government has become involved in providing essential goods and services when they were not available under reasonable circumstances from the private sector. When the provision of these goods and services is commercialised, charges are levied for them which may be too expensive for the consumer. In this case, the consumers' access to these goods and services has been safeguarded by the government imposing community service obligations&mdash;CSOs&mdash;on those relevant businesses to supply what is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee examined the system by which CSOs are identified, costed and funded, and has recommended that more attention be given to defining CSOs so that the social outcomes that the government requires are precisely known, and the methods of costing and funding them are clear. This observation applies whether the CSO is being delivered by a government-owned business or by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One avenue for monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of CSO programs is through so-called performance audits. The committee believes that there are strong arguments for the Auditor-General, who is at present effectively barred from carrying out performance audits on GBEs, being able to examine the delivery of CSOs. Scrutiny of the operation of CSO mechanisms by the Australian National Audit Office may bring substantial improvements to the efficiency with which CSOs are delivered. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the prerequisites for commercial success when parts of government departments are commercialised is that they are able to focus single-mindedly on their commercial activities. Thus, when a government business is commissioned to perform a social function, it is important that the business's commercial focus is not unnecessarily blurred by its social responsibility. Conversely, it is equally important that a businesses' commercial activities not impinge on its social welfare functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the now commercialised sections of government departments formerly had policy and regulatory roles as well as social welfare responsibilities. With the introduction of commercialisation, these policy and regulatory roles need to be removed from these businesses and either transferred to other agencies or, if the government considers it appropriate, be dropped altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it was frequently quoted to the committee, it was not clear that the full implications of this principle of separating different functions had been grasped and that adequate steps had been taken to implement it. The committee acknowledges that the government's businesses now no longer have regulatory functions in areas where they now compete with the private sector. However, the experiences of the CAA have drawn attention to the problems that can arise with the combination within the same organisation of a commercial function&mdash;for example, air traffic control&mdash;and a regulatory function that does not have a commercial focus&mdash;for example air safety. The committee found that this situation has led to confusion among the CAA's clients and within the organisation itself. The committee welcomes the government decision to separate those two functions and has recommended that agencies with similar combinations of functions should be so reorganised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two other businesses that came to the committee's attention where the potential for a conflict between different objectives appeared possible. One such business is the legal practice of the Attorney-General's Department, which provides legal services to the government on both a commercial and public interest basis. The other business which is perceived as being caught in a conflict of interest is the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group, AUSLIG, with its large public interest function and a smaller commercial one. In both these instances there may be a case for separating the functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some circumstances it may not be possible to separate different functions. With such cases, very clear guidance must be provided on structures that can be set up to minimise conflicts of interest and to manage any conflicts that do arise. It may be appropriate at times to provide an independent review of areas where apparent conflicts of interest are causing concern. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Oversight of government businesses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime responsibility for the oversight of a GBE's performance lies with the minister responsible for the industry sector in which that GBE operates. In carrying out this responsibility, the responsible or portfolio minister liaises closely with the Minister for Finance on the financial aspects of the GBE's performance. In this arrangement the portfolio minister has a diverse range of interests&mdash;for example, he or she is interested in the financial performance of portfolio GBEs, sets policy for the industries in which the GBEs operate, and ensures that appropriate regulation is in place. By analogy with the considerations that I have just raised in relation to the CAA, the legal practice and AUSLIG, it appears that such an arrangement may expose portfolio ministers to a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was interested to learn during a visit to New Zealand that in that country a different system for GBE oversight has been established. In the New Zealand system, responsibility for policy affecting state-owned enterprises rests with a different minister from the one who is responsible for their financial performance. In fact the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises are joint shareholders of all state-owned enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first glance, the committee felt that the New Zealand model had much to commend it. Compared with the Commonwealth's arrangements, this model appeared:</PARA>
<PARA>.to allow more consistent monitoring of GBE performance;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee explored these points with a number of Commonwealth agencies and GBEs and found little support for any of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The agencies argued, with a consistent voice, that there should not be too great a focus on the commercial performance of GBEs. For example, a sole focus on commercial performance of the CAA's air traffic services might jeopardise its emphasis on safety and erode public confidence in the safe operation of Australia's air traffic services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.They argued further that, with the Commonwealth's current arrangements, the strategic direction for each GBE is set by negotiation between the GBE's board and the responsible minister. This minister is said to be knowledgeable about the circumstances under which the GBE operates in a way that would not be possible for a minister who had responsibility for all GBEs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Furthermore, it was pointed out to the committee that the involvement of the Minister for Finance in GBE oversight provides a check on the portfolio ministers, and any conflict between them can be brought to the Cabinet and resolved there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee concluded that at present there is no compelling evidence that major changes need to be made to the Commonwealth model of GBE oversight. While the New Zealand system of GBE oversight has worked well in that country, so too has the Commonwealth model in Australia. Government businesses, central agencies and portfolio departments all reported to the committee that they were satisfied with the way in which the current arrangements are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before finishing I would like to refer briefly to the question of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">whether the government should be involved in business at all</EMPHASIS>. The committee accepts that it is appropriate for the government to be involved in a range of commercial activities. For example, it is appropriate for the government to operate businesses so as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to provide services that are not available from the private sector; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to foster the development of emerging markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By being involved in business the government can also maintain the sort of expertise needed to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.facilitate the work of the private sector through joint ventures, export enhancement and technology transfer; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.develop effective monitoring and regulatory regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the judgment of precisely how involved the government should be is difficult and is subject to change over time. The committee notes that in recent times the government has moved to sell a number of its GBEs. The program of asset sales is based on considerations of whether the public interest is best served by owning these businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the considerations are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether significant competition already exists in the market in which the GBE operates;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether increased market exposure would bring improved performance;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether the enterprise would benefit from the sort of strategic partnerships and capital injections that can be negotiated in the marketplace; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether social objectives are still dependent on public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee believes that the government's commitment to a continuing examination of its involvement in commercial activities is appropriate. I note in passing that the Auditor-General is currently conducting a performance audit into the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedures used in the sale of Commonwealth assets. Given the magnitude of the returns expected, and already achieved, from the asset sales program, it is important that the sales process be conducted as efficiently as possible. The committee awaits the Auditor-General's report with interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the committee believes that government businesses have greatly improved their level of performance since the introduction of commercialisation and corporatisation. There is evidence also that they are determined to improve further still. In this they will be assisted by the recommendations contained in the committee's report, particularly those which call on the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to update the operating framework for government businesses;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to clearly define, cost and fund CSOs; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to avoid imposing on government businesses conflicting commercial, policy and regulatory functions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee's fourth report for 1995 relates to the refurbishment of Australia House, London. The proposal includes the implementation of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment, and providing office accommodation which meets current data and communication needs; and the refurbishment of areas surplus to High Commission requirements for leasing to state governments and other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the work proceed at an estimated cost of $14.25 million at May 1994 prices. Australia House has been Australia's showcase in central London since it was officially opened by King George V on 3 August 1918. Peak occupancy occurred during the post-Second World War immigration boom. However, continuing staff reductions since that time have resulted in surplus space in Australia House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, you might be aware that there was some talk a few years back about selling Australia House. That would have been an absolute disaster because it is such a fine building. But it has run into disrepair and so I am pleased to see that at last the government has seen fit to do something about it. Australia House is Australia's oldest overseas mission and a London landmark building classified by English Heritage. The building was constructed during 1913-18 using substantial amounts of Australian timbers and marble. It is the oldest originally occupied chancery of any foreign mission in London. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years various parts of Australia House have been renovated on an as-required basis, but no comprehensive renovation program has been undertaken since it was completed&mdash;although the public areas have been maintained at a high level. Whilst the exterior has been comparatively well maintained, the interior condition is variable and many of the building services are at the end of their safe and useful life. At the request of the committee, the Overseas Property Group examined various options for the use of the sixth floor, which will be left vacant due to the movement of communications facilities to the third floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has concluded that, on the evidence provided to it from the Australian High Commission in London, the sixth floor of Australia House is not suitable for conversion to provide long-term residential accommodation but is suitable for transit accommodation or office accommodation. The committee has therefore recommended that the sixth floor should be converted for use as transit accommodation or office accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's fifth report from 1995 refers to the proposal to relocate the Victorian based activities of the CSIRO's Division of Food Science and Technology from Highett to the Werribee technology precinct. The proposal is part of a program of integrating food research activities in Victoria. The new facilities will be constructed in an area immediately adjacent to those of the Victorian government's Australian Food Research Institute. The complex has been designed recognising the need to develop a close working relationship with the Australian Food Research Institute. Buildings have been sited to encourage staff interaction between the two organisations. The proposal which has been recommended by the committee is estimated to cost $10.1 million at September 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO advised that remaining at Highett was not considered to be sustainable because of the continued fragmentation of research for the dairy industry whilst occupying different sites; the increasing costs of support activities which are detracting from research funding; the potential for reduced support from the Dairy Research and Development Corporation; the need for a capital injection of approximately $5.8 million for refurbishment of the laboratory; and the fact that some facilities at Highett are cramped and, even with a half-life refit, the continuing location of the laboratory at Highett will isolate it from other food activities at Werribee and reduce industry focus and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there was widespread support for the proposal from the Victorian government and industry groups, the CSIRO Division of the Community and Public Sector Union raised concerns regarding the proposal, particularly the impact on the research program. The committee, having carefully considered all the evidence presented to it, is of the view that relocation to Werribee is the most viable long-term option. Mr Barry Jones had quite an interest in this project and he gave evidence to our committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that collocation at Werribee with the Australian Food Research Institute will lead to advantages in research collaboration and in reduced infrastructure costs through the sharing of common facilities such as the library, canteen, auditorium and workshops. In addition, relocation to Werribee offers the opportunity for collaboration with a wide range of both public and private research bodies which are or will soon be established in the Werribee area. The committee is also aware that the Dairy Research and Development Corporation has offered CSIRO a grant of $4 million towards equipment at Werribee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee accepts and understands the reluctance of staff to relocate to Werribee and also agrees that the relocation will have some temporary adverse impact on the research effort, the committee believes that the relocation will have a positive long-term impact on the work of the laboratory. In particular, the project provides opportunity to develop a coordinated research and development centre for the food industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third report which I have tabled deals with the proposed redevelopment of housing for service families at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS>. My colleague Senator Newman would know just how long overdue that is. By way of background, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> is a significant and expanding Royal Australian Navy training establishment located at Western Port. There are currently 554 families located both on board HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> and ashore in the surrounding area. And it is approximately five miles from the Stony vineyard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal which the committee examined is aimed to partially redress the imbalance in housing available on board compared with ashore by increasing on board housing from 109 to 152 in accordance with the DHA mission to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the works examined by the committee is the provision of an additional 55 houses on new and revised lots, the provision of 45 houses as replacements for existing substandard houses, substantial upgrading or replacement of 10 existing older brick houses and the retention of 27 existing houses which require less substantial works. When referred to the committee, the estimated cost of the proposed redevelopment was $14.2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending that the redevelopment should proceed, the committee has concluded that there is a need to replace or modernise existing on-board housing at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> to match contemporary standards and expectations. Many of the on-base houses are well below acceptable community standards. I must say that some of the old brick houses that are to be refurbished should be heritage-listed; they are magnificent homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the overall scope of the project, the committee has concluded that it is soundly based, the extent can be justified on the grounds of reduced cost penalties associated with the payment by Defence of isolated establishment allowances, will enhance personnel efficiencies and makes good use of available land. A number of design features were commented upon during our inquiry and the committee therefore believes that the Defence Housing Authority should continue consultations with the tenants consultative group concerning the provision of features and fittings which will enhance the habitability of the houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is planned that the housing area at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus </EMPHASIS>may be excised from the base sometime in the future.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Housing Assistance Act 1989; and the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation (The Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982, The Homes Savings Grant Act 1964, The Homes Savings Grant Act 1976).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, I would like to explain the provisions of the bill in relation to the Housing Assistance Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is unequivocally committed to the principle that housing is a basic human right and that all governments have a responsibility to ensure the housing needs of all Australians are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this commitment the Commonwealth provides untied financial assistance to the States under the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to deliver housing assistance, predominantly for building or purchase of public rental housing stock but also for home purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA). The current CSHA is at Schedule 1 of the existing act; the CSHA is up for renegotiation with the aim of having a new Agreement in place by 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSHA requires States to match Commonwealth untied assistance on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with at least half of the matching provided through State grants and the balance through the value of loans made under home purchase assistance (HPA) schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulties with matching have arisen in recent years for States as a result of increased attractiveness of commercially available loans in the current economic climate and a poor public image for some State products, leading most States to reduce their home lending activities. The affected States have been unable to provide additional grant funding to meet their matching obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to amendments made to the act last year, the Commonwealth was required to recover financial assistance provided in earlier years from States that did not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance schemes. Similarly, where some States indicated that they were unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements, the act, prior to amendment, required that the Minister not provide unmatched funds, reducing untied grants to the level that would be matched.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considered that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided was undesirable. It would reduce funds for public housing and disadvantage those most in need of assistance. It would also be undesirable to pursue such action where States are genuinely unable to meet such requirements because of changed market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was for these reasons that the amendments to section 15 of the act which allowed the Minister to waive these provisions were made last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not expected at the time of the previous amendments that States would continue to have matching difficulties. The amendments outlined in this bill extend these waiving provisions for what is expected to be the final, and seventh, year of the current CSHA:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to subsection 15(2A) of the act extends its application to the seventh grant year (1995-96), in addition to the sixth grant year (1994-95) of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 15(2A) of the act enables the Commonwealth Minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular State, even if the Minister cannot ensure that the State can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with paragraph 13(2)(b) of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to subsection 15A(2) of the act extends section 15A to the seventh grant year (1995-96), in addition to the fifth (1993-94) and sixth grant years (1994-95)of the CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 15A enables the Minister to make a determination to effectively waive or reduce a State or Territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance, provided by the Commonwealth to a State, from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs in a grant year where that State has not been able to meet the level required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any decision to waive or reduce the home purchase assistance matching requirement will be taken after careful consideration of the circumstances leading to the need for such a course of action and determined on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The longer term issue of matching will be addressed in the process of renegotiating a new CSHA. The amendments will not result in any additional Commonwealth outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to turn to the provisions of the bill relevant to the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Budget Speech of 21 August 1990 the Government announced its decision to terminate the First Home Owners Scheme as a part of its plan to restructure Commonwealth home ownership assistance arrangements. Legislation was introduced amending the First Home Owners Act 1983 so that it would not have effect in respect of homes acquired after that date. That legislation also fixed 30 June 1991 as the last date for applications for assistance under the act. However, applicants coming within those deadlines remained eligible for a stream of monthly assistance payments over five years from the date of acquiring their home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in 1994 to the First Home Owners Regulations allowed final payments to remaining eligible clients to be aggregated and brought forward. The bulk of these payments were despatched in November 1994 and after 30 June 1995 there will be ongoing administrative activity only of a minor nature. Accordingly, this bill amends the reporting requirements of the act, to provide that no annual report on its administration and operation will be required after the 1994-95 report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently, no time limit is prescribed in the act for appeals from decisions made under it. To assist in winding up the Scheme's administration this bill sets 31 August 1995 as the cut-off date for such appeals. For the few appealable decisions which may be made close to that date or thereafter, a period of 28 days from the date the decision is furnished to the applicant is proposed. Further, the bill curtails the power of the Secretary of the Department to reopen applications for reconsideration after that date. Notifications of decisions under the First Home Owners Act have always been required to include an explanation of the client's right to seek review, including by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Few decisions have been made since the two years after the cut-off date for applications. With few exceptions, applicants now have had a number of years to consider decisions affecting them and to lodge an appeal. It is now time to draw this Scheme to a close.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, any decisions still to be made will be subject to the proposed 28 day limit to seek Departmental review; the existing right and time limit will continue to apply for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from decisions of the Department. Similarly, the legislation does not affect the review procedures available to individuals under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also add that the Government will undertake appropriate action to notify clients of the time lines for the revised review procedures. This will involve advertisements in national newspapers over a two week period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier first home ownership assistance schemes are governed by the 1964 and 1976 Homes Savings Grant Acts and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. These, too, contain no time limits for appeals from decisions made under them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, to assist in winding up their administration, the bill proposes arrangements similar to those proposed for the First Home Owners Act 1983. The bill also incorporates machinery amendments to the provisions of the earlier acts relating to making and notification of decisions under them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aside from modest costs associated with the campaign to publicise the cut-off date for appeals, the amendments to the first home owners assistance legislation have no identifiable financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

It is a matter of working as hard as we can with doctors, hospitals and funds towards the desired outcomes.

Ostensibly, it is a tax on health insurers to pay for this complaints procedure. But, like everything in life, somebody has to pay for it. Ultimately, it will be the contributors to insurance who will pay for this. It sets a precedent in so far as it is expecting consumers to pay for a committee that is established by the industry&mdash;but the consumers are the industry; so the tax is on them. For that reason we are opposing this legislation. We are not against the establishment of a complaints procedure or a complaints commissioner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 does not address the major problems affecting the delivery of health care in this country. They should be well known to everybody. There is an inability of the public hospital system to cope with the demand. There is a rapidly ageing population. As an aside, this is important electorally to all political parties in so far as 40 per cent of electors are now over the age of 50. So it has relevance in that regard. Not only do we have a rapidly ageing population; we also have the increasing use of technology and the inevitable cost increase that occurs with the use of that technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public hospital system in Australia is in a shambles. Waiting lists in my state have extended rapidly because of their inability to cope with the demands made upon them. This legislation introduces a number of features, one of which is casemix funding. Only time will tell whether that makes any difference in terms of an ability to constrain cost. It is almost like King Canute trying to stop the waves when this demand is being placed on the systems by an ageing population, increasing technology and the rapidly declining ability of the public hospital systems of Australia to cope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One answer to it is to make private health insurance more attractive so that people will move into the private hospital system. We have in Australia a very well advanced and, in some respects, technologically superior private hospital system in so far as there are approximately 900 hospitals in Australia, two-thirds of which are public hospitals and one-third of which are private hospitals. But public hospitals also cope with some private demand and treat private patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this government has been in power, we have seen a rapid decrease in the number of people privately insured and accessing the private hospitals. There has been a decrease from 70 per cent to now less than 40 per cent; it was 36.3 per cent in December last year. In my state of Queensland, it is below 30 per cent. It is fatuous to say that this does not produce an enormous demand on the public hospital system. Why has this occurred? What is the reason for the decrease in the number of people who are privately insured?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer is fairly simple: they cannot afford the premiums, particularly young families. We have just been through the worst recession in 60 years&mdash;the so-called recession we had to have, produced by this government. More importantly, they have been ideologically driven to try to force people out of private health insurance. It is within that background that this legislation came forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This legislation has three principal components. Honourable senators will recall the speech given by the minister. She said that the bill was aimed at reducing premiums. It was aimed at making private hospitals cheaper, and it was aimed at lowering the return to private hospitals and the income of doctors. It was ideologically driven to a large degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the introduction of this legislation, the private hospitals have contracted to insurance companies virtually throughout Australia. Some had already done so, and I suppose it could be claimed that this legislation accelerated that. The important point is that it occurred regardless of the legislation. Half the legislation will not be applicable in that regard in so far as it has been achieved. A bit like the budget a few days ago, it was smoke and mirrors. One of the large insurance companies actually increased its premiums. It changed the names and produced different tables. That was the government's own insurance company, Medibank Private. The premiums for the principal table that would give 100 per cent cover increased by $2.30 a week. It was a change of name but an increase in cost. This will inevitably lead to a decline in the number of people privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not address the major reasons why Australians are leaving health insurance. Even the Executive Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association said that all he believed it would achieve was a slowing in the increase of premiums, not that it would reduce premiums for health insurance. The secretary to the department acknowledged that he did not know the outcome of this legislation. That is a very valid point. Inevitably, as I mentioned, the prices for similar coverage have already increased. Even if private hospitals could become 10 per cent more efficient, it would potentially reduce premiums by less than $1 a week. They have already increased by that in the last week or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that this legislation will end community rating. The bill encourages funds to provide  reduced coverage, reduced services or reduced choice. These are the only products that can possibly be made cheaper. If, as the minister says, this legislation will make less money available to private hospitals, there has to be a reduction in the quality of care provided or a reduction in the services provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third point is that it delivers the private hospital industry into the hands of large private health insurers. The default payment will only mean that a hospital goes broke more slowly because it cannot exist on the default payment, which is the payment that will go to the hospital if a patient goes there and the medical practitioner and/or the hospital do not have a contract with the health insurer. If the insurer does not want to contract, the Trade Practices Commissioner can do nothing. We have had that in the letter from him. The spurious defence that there is a Trade Practices Commissioner at the end who can act as an arbiter between the two bodies does not stand up in the light of the submission from the Trade Practices Commission itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, if an insurer acts unfairly or misuses market power, the Trade Practices Commission can certainly investigate but will find it difficult to prove. And, of course, while that is going on, the hospital has gone broke. So that defence is spurious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that within that context of delivering the private hospital industry into the hands of large private health insurers, hospitals and doctors cannot negotiate in groups without authorisation. Authorisation takes months, it is very costly and there is no guarantee of success. The complaints commissioner&mdash;the body that we have just established by the passage of that last bill&mdash;can only recommend even if the Trade Practices Commission says that it is investigating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real bottom line of this legislation is that it puts hospitals and insurance companies under greater control of government&mdash;the ideological premise of which I know the government and, I suspect, the Democrats are totally supportive. They must be aware that this will occur because everything goes back to government control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucrats love it&mdash;more bureaucracy! I notice a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> today that Mr Johns in the other chamber said that there will be less bureaucrats around. He has not seen this legislation. I think they will be compensated for by an increase in the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already 6,000 federal bureaucrats in the Commonwealth department of health pressing computer buttons&mdash;I do not know about paper. This will be another bureaucratic bonanza for them. No wonder the department is very much in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost in premiums and the types of products offered have to be ratified by the department of health. It knows best, government knows best&mdash;not the marketplace, not the patients, not the doctors, not the hospitals. The department of health ratifies everything and, of course, the minister can decide what is acceptable treatment in a hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you might think that fatuous and you might think that is rhetoric, but I have before me an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Philadelphia Enquirer</EMPHASIS> of 21 March this year entitled `Shift to HMOs brings warnings on abuses', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Critics allege that care is being delayed or denied. The Justice Department has formed a task force.</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation is leading us down that same path. God knows why we have to adopt American systems at the very time that they are going out in the States. We seem inevitably in Australia to believe that something done overseas has to be better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian health care system, while seriously ill, and some would say terminally ill, can be resuscitated, but it is not going to be resuscitated by this legislation. It does open itself up to an enormous number of changes&mdash;and I quote from this article again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a growing chorus of criticism from legislators, patient advocates, consumer groups and doctors that health maintenance organisations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>you can read `preferred provider organisations' if you like because it is the same thing; the same girl, different hat&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because HMOs are delaying or denying care to save money, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critics contend that the same practices that enabled health maintenance organisations to provide health care savings may also create financial incentives for providers to skimp on care so that they can maximise profits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the direction in which we are heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth department receives identified, commercially sensitive data from private hospitals and private insurers, as does the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council. One amendment that we achieved on this side, with the support of the Australian Democrats, puts at least some constraints on that information. We look forward to further constraints being put in place as a result of other amendments that were carried. Privacy protection is of vital importance but it has not been sufficiently acknowledged in this legislation. We will continue to press for that when the legislation comes up for review before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is now largely unnecessary as contracts between hospitals and insurers are almost complete. It offers the opportunity for contracts with doctors and, provided these are voluntary and without duress, the opposition has no difficulty with them. But the bottom line is that if cost savings are to occur, as the minister believes they will, inevitably, there will be pressure on the doctors to change the types of treatment they order as a way of maximising profit. If anyone does not believe that, they only have to look at what has happened in relation to general practitioners and bulk-billing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence shows that the number of radiology and pathology services ordered has raced away and that the number of patients seen in major bulk-billing clinics has also raced away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this bill is just another fiddle by the government, pretending it is doing something about the health system when it is really doing nothing. This seems to occur every two years. I have been here for five years and there have been three health ministers in the last three years and three heads of department&mdash;the current one has only just been appointed&mdash;and here we go again. In 1989 we had the re-insurance changes. In 1990-92 we had the national health strategy. In 1993 we had the Richardson reforms. Mixed in with all of that was the attempted introduction of co-payment in an attempt to put some constraints on the system. There was a shift in the Left, factional fighting within the Labour Party and we got a new Prime Minister out of that. And here we are today with yet another fiddle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this legislation is to let the private health insurance level fall so that more Australians have to rely on Medicare. Meanwhile, the states are screaming about extra demand and are trying to solve their lack of funding by measures such as casemix and cost shifting. We have not alluded to cost shifting in this legislation but one of the major problems with regard to health care is the cost shifting that goes on between states. There are other measures in the budget that attempt to penalise the states where they practice cost shifting, for example, by having pharmaceuticals dispensed outside the hospital system so that they become a charge on Medicare rather than on the state hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2000, if present trends continue, the Medicare levy will have to increase. It is now producing only about $3 billion of the $18 billion that is spent on health care by the Commonwealth government. With this budget we have just another Medicare tax, another burden on the taxpayer and&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing illustrated by this legislation is the fact that we have had 96 amendments in this chamber. Obviously that matter should have gone off, as I asked in my motion, to a legislation committee. We had a quick and dirty look through by a legislation committee, which reported back. Even after that&mdash;and the majority report was supported by the Democrats in that regard&mdash;we had 96 amendments introduced on the floor of the chamber, 54 of which were introduced jointly by the government and the Democrats. There should be no complaint from the Labor Party whip or the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) in this regard. Those amendments obviously should have gone off to a legislation committee, which was my original intention. That motion was not supported by the Democrats, so they cannot complain about the processes of this legislation either. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook asked me, `What's the answer?' The answer, Senator Cook, is to make private insurance more equitable and more attractive to people because of this drop-off in private insurance. There is a need for an increase in private health insurance in this country, as I mentioned. Medicare has meant, of course, that the GPs are totally dependent on the government for their payments. What is happening to them? If anybody has ever been dudded, it is the general practitioners of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers stated that there is going to be an increase of, I think, 1.7 per cent in the Medicare refunds&mdash;the GPs are going to get half of it and the rest is going by capitation, just as it did in the last budget. If that is not government control, nothing is. So the government is heading in that direction. We will end up with most of the population relying on public hospitals. Private hospitals will have to take public patients or they will go broke. We will get private hospitals becoming public hospitals. Specialists will spend most of their time treating patients by whatever method the government decides, and probably on sessional rates. It is a very grim picture that faces the country through the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

I look forward to the review in a year's time as to what will occur in relation to this legislation. It has no chance of achieving what you believe it will achieve. Half of it has been gutted by the fact that the private hospitals have taken out contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that the minister talked about consultation. If there had been consultation, we would not have been through this process of amendment that we have had in this chamber over the last few days. The consultation did not occur. The argument that consultation had occurred was spurious. There was a long list of various people who had been notified. When we looked into that, of course, we saw that the list included bodies that had been involved in the ACTU caucus working paper, the Richardson discussions that had occurred and the various bodies that were announced. Then, out of the blue, this legislation was produced without anybody being aware. That was the evidence that we were given by everybody who appeared before the legislation committee&mdash;short as those hearings were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a mishmash of legislation. The secretary to the department acknowledges that he does not know the outcome of it. The very night that we were discussing this legislation, the budget came down and the Medicare levy was increased. This inevitably puts further pressure on private health insurance because every time&mdash;and this is an historical fact&mdash;the Medicare levy goes up, the numbers of those privately insured drops. There is no way that that will not occur in the future as a result of those budget changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other crazy part about it in relation to doctors is that if the funds could persuade doctors to work for no cost to the funds&mdash;that is, for only 75 per cent of the government schedule and forgoing the 25 per cent paid by the funds&mdash;premiums would be reduced by only 5.9 per cent. If the funds could persuade the doctors to take an across-the-board cut of 10 per cent in their medical fees, this would reduce premiums by approximately 2.3 per cent. The likely outcome is that in many specialties and in many regions&mdash;the minister acknowledged this&mdash;doctors will be able to win higher fees on average from the funds than they now charge. Again, it is a spurious argument that it is going to lower costs. The minister said in relation to an amendment that it will mean increased fees for many specialists, so how can you increase the fees and not produce increased cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, premiums will rise as a result of the legislation. According to the department's own figures, hospital gaps currently amount to about $200 million a year. Again, according to its figures, medical gaps amount to $136 million. The effect of offering no gaps tables will be to transfer these charges from the individual to insurance premiums for all those who take out no gaps packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Private Hospitals Association has always said there will be a high level of no gaps hospital contracting, so it would be reasonable to assume that in the first instance all hospital charges will remain roughly where they are now and the $200 million will be absorbed into increased premiums. That will be the effect of this legislation. It will mean increased premium costs. It will mean a drop-off in private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us suppose, for example, that 25 per cent of specialists would be interested to the extent that they would be forced into signing contracts with health funds. Let us make an assumption that these doctors would contract at roughly the same level of fees that they presently charge and that they are a representative group in terms of gap medical charges. You would need to absorb another $34 million into the premium cost. So you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say on the one hand it will reduce the income of doctors and on the other hand they will be getting higher fees from this legislation. It does not make sense, just as many of the other measures in this legislation do not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take into account the government's own figures, the full impact of all those measures will be a cost of about $400 million and that will require an increase in premiums of at least 10 per cent. Of course, that would be a disaster for the industry. The only way in which increases could be avoided would be by reducing the range of services covered or by reducing quality. The minister will recall that I asked the then secretary to the department&mdash;three secretaries ago&mdash;how one defined quality, because the word `quality' did not appear in the department's report. Not once did the word `quality' appear. Magically, it appeared in the next annual report of the department, all over the place. `Quality' was dripping out of it next time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, when I questioned the measurement of quality, it was the provision of technology. It showed complete ignorance of what occurs within private hospitals, and the rapport that doctors have with their patients and patients with doctors. You choose a doctor with whom you have rapport, or you do not. This will restrict choice of doctor because it inevitably restricts your choice to those who have contracts with private hospitals. It restricts your choice to those who have contracts with insurance companies. You cannot get around that. It restricts choice and that is another price that must be paid by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will increase cost shifting, as I have mentioned before. It will inevitably change the mechanism of referrals of patients to doctors. That has not been considered. It will do so because this complex process means that the condition needing treatment must be covered by a particular policy held; the preferred doctor must have arrangements with the patient's insurer; the insurer must have arrangements with a conveniently located hospital; the surgeon must have arrangements which include a convenient hospital; and an anaesthetist who visits that hospital must have an arrangement with the fund. And so it goes on and on. That is what this legislation is bringing in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked what the opposition will do in relation to this legislation. Inevitably this legislation will pass because of the support of the Australian Democrats. We reserve our right to review and amend this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Senate&mdash;indeed the parliament as a whole&mdash;is dealing with legislation, its primary concern must be for the sick person. I am concerned that that is not the priority in this legislation. It appears to me that the government is concerned&mdash;and probably correctly concerned&mdash;about the flight of people from the private health insurance funds. This legislation appears to be one response to that concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sick, the frail aged, the chronically ill and private psychiatric patients should be distressed that matters of their welfare, health and well-being are not going to be determined by themselves, their families or their medical practitioners, but by economists in the insurance companies and by bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has not really been addressed in this legislation. There are some unexceptional provisions in this legislation which I would support. I was hoping to be able to support the whole of the legislation, but this particular matter is of such concern to me that I would not be able to do so. This bill provides for contracts to be undertaken between insurance companies, doctors and hospitals&mdash;contracts that will be determined by the insurance industry and the bureaucrats. If we go along the case payments path the patients' well-being and health will be at risk. I say this with some feeling because I am aware of a number of people who are chronically ill and a number of people with severe psychiatric problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go along the path of a diagnostic approach, that is to say that insurers will fund the hospital for the diagnosis rather than for the care of the person and for an assessment of the extent of that person's illness, then these are matters that will be determined by health bureaucrats and insurers particularly. We will then be taking user-pays and economic rationalism to its extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are quite a number of other things that I would like to talk about but I will not do so at this juncture since this is the third reading and not the time to do this. I will give an example that has been given to me by a person whom I know quite well who is rather concerned about this situation. That person is rather concerned about the fact that there will be, as a result of this legislation, a situation where patients will be discharged before their time, when they will be discharged sooner and sicker. Of course that is not the way to deal with people; it is not a very economical way to deal with the situation in the long run in any event. </PARA>
<PARA>There could be distressed patients waiting for days for admission and treatment. There could be patients lying in unrelieved pain or discomfort. There could be patients in a wet bed for hours due to lack of nursing attention. There could be chronically ill patients who are denied admission and who are not entered into the collective data. Because of this economically-driven rationalism, there could be an inferior prothesis being used which is subject to a greater risk of breakdown. Patients could be sent home unable to care for themselves or sent to a stressed household, or left alone or entirely neglected. </PARA>
<PARA>Those matters that I have just mentioned appear to be matters which are ignored in the assessment of efficiency. I hope the government will correct me if I am wrong but, as I understand it, when the assessments for efficiency are taking place those matters will be ignored. That does give me a considerable amount of concern. I hope I am wrong. I hope that this legislation does not have that effect, but it appears to me at this point in time that they are the possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Another problem that I foresee is that there will be many different contractual arrangements made between insurers, hospitals and doctors. That is going to be confusing for ordinary parents&mdash;the mothers and the fathers&mdash;who make these decisions on behalf of their families. They are unlikely to have access to details of the agreements entered into between the hospitals and the health insurance funds. They certainly would find it most difficult to make those particular decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many burdens now being placed upon those families by the government. As I indicated in my response to the budget, these families are being adversely affected by the government's budget. In fact, this budget will have the effect of requiring more families to have both parents forced into the paid work force just to make ends meet. In those sorts of situations there does arise a great deal of stress. When decisions upon these matters need to be taken, where there will be such strength, I suppose, and such control given to economists in insurance companies and to health bureaucrats, then there will be a lack of faith in the insurance industry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, this legislation will do the opposite to what the government intends. As a result of this legislation, in my view, there will be more people abandoning their private health insurance and simply going onto the public health system. The result of that will not be what the government wants. The result of that will be an extension of the waiting list for public hospitals. That is what concerns me. Again, I hope I am wrong and that that does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be very interested to see the results of the review of this legislation which will take place within a period of 12 months. I do not normally stand up in this place and say, `I told you so.' I sincerely hope, if I am around at that stage, that I do not have to get up in this chamber and say to the government, `I told you so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to keep a very close monitor upon what is taking place between the private insurance industry and the hospitals. I ask the government to monitor this from the point of view of the immediate and the direct health and the long-term health and wellbeing of the patient and his or her family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly in relation to this legislation simply to place on the public record the position of the Greens (WA). As mentioned by Senator Harradine, our primary point of reference&mdash;and I am sure the underlying motivation of all people who have contributed to the debate&mdash;is the wellbeing of community members on whom this legislation will impact. I share some of the concerns that Senator Harradine has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach taken by the government in this legislation is not the preferred position of the Greens. However, by ascertaining, on balance, the legislation and the opposition's approach to it, we have decided that we are closer to the government's position than that of the opposition, as expressed in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe that access to a comprehensive health system is a fundamental right. We support the continued development of a publicly funded Medicare system to include dental health, mental health promotion, public health, family planning, occupational health and alternative forms of health care. Maximum diversity and choice in forms of health care is of major importance to us. In order to ensure an equitable society, the best quality health care must be equally available to all Australians. Individual health is connected to the health of all of us. Exceptional health care is both a human right and a common good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interrelationship of Medicare and the private health insurance industry is relevant to the Greens, primarily as this relationship affects the public health system. However, we do care that consumers of private health insurance also get the best possible health results. Reforms to the private health insurance industry are therefore necessary to empower consumers. This bill will provide individual fund members with a better capacity to complain and seek redress. The private health insurance industry needs to become more efficient and provide a better product. We believe that the accountability of the private health insurance industry will be, and should be, enhanced if this legislation is effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical purchaser-provider agreements may eliminate a privately insured patient's out-of-pocket expenses owed to a medical practitioner by providing for full payment by a health benefits organisation of the costs of an in-hospital professional service. The Greens are extremely concerned that casemix funding should be at an adequate level. We are concerned as to how patients will fare under the managed care contracts. We, too, will be monitoring the way in which this legislation is put into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are even more concerned about the increasing trend to commercialise the delivery of health care. Health care cannot be made subject to the same market forces as are clothing and motor vehicles. If a two-tier system develops, the potential for discrimination against those who cannot afford the private system can result in public services being reduced, unresourced or stigmatised. The two-tiered system is anathema to Australian ideals of social justice, equality and egalitarianism. Exclusion of the poor and powerless from the highest standard of health care is an intolerable prospect. Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of ill-health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned over the increasing trend to commercialise the delivery of health care. The dominance of economists, planners and accountants involved in social policy is leading to health care being made subject to the same market forces as fashion, restaurants and motor cars. Instead, Medicare must be strengthened and supported. Medicare offers the most positive answers to the best possible health care to all Australians. As a compassionate community, we must be ever vigilant to any erosion of human rights. In our view, Medicare must be supported and strengthened to ensure that all residents have reasonable access to basic medical and hospital treatment. It is important that the integrity of Medicare be preserved in any major reform of the system, and this includes its essential principles of universal access and a degree of public control over health service costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view that has been put forward by the government is that one way of addressing the pressure on the public health system is to allow those who have the capacity for private health insurance to have an incentive&mdash;the gap payment&mdash;that will allow them to exercise both choice and that particular convenience. The medical profession has been trying to address some of the problems of the failure to account to the community for the fee system and fee structure of its own professionals. However, it has not been able to address it specifically from the point of view of the individual consumer. That is one advantage that this legislative system may put in place&mdash;that we can actually assess the burden that goes to individuals as a result of the different fees charged and schemes that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I commend the hard work and thoroughness involved in this legislationand debate, particularly by Senator Meg Lees. I thank her for keeping me informed about the amendments of the Democrats and the government and about the submissions and criticisms that have been made. I also appreciate the information provided by the opposition and by the minister for health and her staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are fairly stretched in trying to cover all the portfolios. We do not believe in duplication of a job when it is being well done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill, which is now before the chamber, follows the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS> which was produced by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in June 1994. This was a particularly noteworthy report by the joint standing committee in that, in the tradition of that committee, it was a bipartisan report on a very sensitive issue, the funding of parties and their disclosure rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill adopts most of the committee's recommendations to simplify and improve the operation of funding and disclosure rules. However, it has gone somewhat further than the committee report in several respects. To that extent the bill is of some concern to us. It has failed to do some things which we believe would improve the Electoral Act. However, we will move an amendment&mdash;I understand that it has bipartisan support&mdash;that will eliminate any possibility of retrospectivity in the operation of this bill. We support the bill, but with some reservations to which I will refer in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition now accepts that there is a need for some form of disclosure regime. There is no doubt that the 1992 amendments to the regime were unduly complex and placed basically an impossible burden on the political parties, which have simply not been able to meet them. It is my very strong belief and that of my party that healthy, strong, active political parties are essential to the proper and effective functioning of a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political parties comprise thousands of ordinary Australians who volunteer their time, energy and effort to contribute to the political process and democracy. It is very important from our point of view that any legislation in this area governing the political process encourages the active participation of ordinary Australians in the political process. We regard that as essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our perspective that the 1992 amendments to the disclosure rules were a very big disincentive to grassroots involvement in Australian political parties. It is our very strong view that the law should provide incentives to grassroots involvement in the development of mass-based parties and thus reduce what we regard as the dangerous reliance of the parties on funds either from big business, unions or the government itself. It is my strong view that my party has been too reliant on big business and rich individuals. The ALP has certainly been far too reliant on the trade union movement for its funds. There was an example of this problem in South Australia&mdash;my state&mdash;recently with the controversy over the South Australian Liberal Party's acceptance of donations from rich foreign individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very wary about the parties becoming increasingly reliant on government handouts. It is a disturbing trend in Australian society today that increasingly more and more volunteer community groups are becoming reliant on government largesse for their very existence and thus becoming part of a dubious political process. I would be very concerned&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will ignore that interjection from Senator Crowley. It is true that there is a problem in both political parties and other groups becoming reliant on government funds for their very existence. It is a trend that I do not want to see develop. To the extent that this legislation eases the burden on political parties to record and report minute details of their income and expenditure, certainly the bill is to be welcomed. It contains sensible, practical amendments to remove requirements that were often impossible for party volunteers to meet. This bill will, to some extent, assist the parties in retaining and recruiting volunteer workers into their ranks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, this bill proposes that only where individual transactions exceed $500 will particulars of those transactions be required to be recorded. This is probably the most important change in the whole bill. It is the area that has caused the parties the most agony and problems. Our party recommended to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that that threshold be $1,500, given that this figure is a prevailing threshold in other parts of the act. We retain the view that $1,500 is the desirable threshold. But certainly the $500 threshold in this bill is a big improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have a few problems with the bill. I will refer to them. The bill requires donors to political parties to lodge annual returns rather than election returns; that is, a return every year rather than simply a return after an election. It reduces the threshold for the requirement to lodge a return from $4,500 to $1,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposition contradicts a bipartisan recommendation of the joint standing committee that donors be not required to lodge a return. The ALP members agreed with us that this was an utterly redundant proposition. There should be no requirement on donors, given that the parties have to record and report all their donations. So we are concerned that this bill goes much further than the current legislation and totally contradicts what the joint standing committee recommended to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns us because it may operate to some extent to deter small and medium donors to political parties from making donations if they are required to lodge annual returns showing their donations. This contradicts what I was saying before. We should be encouraging small and medium donors to political parties and thus reducing reliance on the big donors. It is an unfortunate part of this bill which I hope we will look at when we are in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most controversial part of the bill is that which extends the disclosure requirements to `associated entities', which are trusts and other similar bodies, that contribute to the parties. Under this bill, they now have to disclose the sources of their capital. Previously, organisations such as trusts were only required, like other donors, to disclose that they donated to a political party. They were not required to disclose the sources of their funds. It was our view that that was a proper arrangement in a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed extension was not recommended by the joint standing committee. We debated this issue at some length. The ALP members agreed with us that it would be improper to go down this track. We are surprised and disturbed that the government has embarked on this course. It is a disturbing extension of government regulation of the political process&mdash;the danger that I pointed to earlier. It is an example which we have seen in the United States; that is, once you start going down this disclosure path, there is no end to it. You keep having to legislate to cover your tracks. It becomes a vicious cycle. Unfortunately, this part of the bill is an example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the joint standing committee hearings, requiring trusts to disclose the source of their capital if they donate to a political party is akin to requiring BHP or Fred's corner store to disclose the source of their income if they make a donation to a political party. I think this is a very dangerous path that this legislation is going down. We are not actually opposing this particular proposition in the bill in a formal sense, as long as the elimination of any retrospectivity is agreed to, which we understand is the case. This measure was not recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and I think it takes this law into a very dangerous new area, an extension that has great difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, in terms of our problem with this bill, it reintroduces a requirement that the parties lodge returns of electoral expenditure. We think this is unnecessary. It is a consequence of the change of public funding from a reimbursement scheme to a direct payments scheme. We welcome the abolition of the reimbursement scheme. We agree that the requirement to lodge claims for public funding is unnecessary and that a direct payments scheme is probably better. I am sure the Democrats would welcome this change as well, given a report in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of 30 April which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police have recommended that at least 13 members of the Australian Democrats be charged with fraud and conspiracy to defraud over alleged misuse of $200,000 of election funding.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding is that this relates to the Democrats' claims for public funding, where you are required to substantiate expenditure. I am not sure what will happen to those charges. No doubt, the Democrats will welcome the change to a direct payments system, which will mean that the parties will no longer be required to prepare claims for public funding. In principle, that is a proposition that we support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not convinced that, as a consequence of the change to a direct payments system, the party should be required to lodge returns of electoral expenditure. After all, all electoral expenditure in an election year must be reported in the party's annual returns. The parties are required to lodge annual returns of their expenditure. That has been the ongoing arrangement for some time now. In an election year, all electoral expenditure will be covered in the return for that year. There is absolutely no point whatsoever in requiring the parties to lodge a separate electoral expenditure return. It serves no purpose whatsoever. There is also an idiotic anomaly introduced as a result of this: election returns have to be lodged within 15 weeks of polling day, while the annual returns, which the parties do every year, must be lodged within 16 weeks of the end of the financial year. It is stupid to have different time periods for these two returns. I hope at some stage that anomaly will be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fourth problem that we have with the bill, although we will not be opposing it, is where the government has not addressed the adequacy at all of the current $100 tax deductibility limit for political donations. That tax deductibility provision was part of the 1992 package and was a very welcome part of that package. We have believed for a very long time that there should be an incentive in our tax system for ordinary Australians to contribute to the party of their choice and thus enhance the democratic process and the involvement of ordinary Australians in it. At that stage, a limit of $100 was set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have argued strongly, and did so at the joint standing committee hearings, that the tax deductibility limit should be increased to $1,500 consistent with the other thresholds in the act which are essentially on the $1,500 level and allowable for both individuals and corporate taxpayers so that small business has some incentive to involve itself in the political process and to support the party of its choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $1,500 level is a general threshold in the act. The increase from $100 to $1,500 is certainly a more realistic threshold that would overcome the problem of the parties becoming far too reliant on trade unions in the case of the Australian Labor Party or big business or rich individuals in our case. So I hope the government in its remaining few months will look at this; we certainly will when we assume the reins of office within a year's time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth area that needs reference in this bill is foreign donations. Neither the joint standing committee report nor this bill makes any reference to foreign donations, but it is referred to in an interesting document which a number of us have had a look at. It is a parliamentary research service paper, No. 21 of 1994-95, entitled, `Election funding disclosure and Australian politics: debunking some myths', which is an interesting review of the operation of public funding and disclosure in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reference to the issue of overseas donations in that document on pages 41 and 42. The report's author suggests that foreign donations are `an obvious future loophole and warrant continued scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the possibility of Australian parties becoming reliant on foreign donations. That would be a dangerous trend for the parties and a retrograde step. With the ALP we saw the shemozzle over the Iraqi donation scandal. It has certainly been my party's longstanding view, at least since that time, that one should be extremely careful about foreign donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly in self-regulation by the parties rather than any legislative regime, which is what I think the author of this particular report is proposing. We should all resist that, but we will only resist that if we all operate with extreme care in the area of foreign donations. It is a responsibility of the parties to ensure they know exactly whom they are getting their money from and that it is all above board. In that way we will be able to prevent the further extension of the law into the internal operations of political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill introduces some sensible reforms to the disclosure rules. It will enhance the capacity of the parties to encourage voluntary grassroots participation in their operations. But a number of areas remain where the rules could be further improved to preserve and enhance the vitality of our parties without compromising the integrity of the electoral system. </PARA>

I want to address a number of general matters relating to the form of the electoral system. This legislation and the legislation in the other chamber do not deal sufficiently with the changes to the existing act that are actually needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address the matter of electoral reform far more comprehensively than has been done so far. The changes in this bill and in the bill that will come to us are basically minor technical changes, tinkering at the edges. We need far more comprehensive reform to the whole electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our electoral system is based on two fundamental principles&mdash;access to the roll and the integrity of the roll. In its approach to electoral matters, the government puts a very strong emphasis on access to the roll. It does that because it argues that in a compulsory voting system it must be as easy as possible for people to cast a vote. We do not dispute that principle but we run into trouble with what the government has done because that principle often cuts across another principle&mdash;the integrity of the roll. We have to ensure that only those people entitled to be on the roll and to cast a valid vote are on the roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, in the government's eagerness to allow easy access to voting, it has compromised the integrity of the roll and I will give some examples of the way that has happened over the last 12 years. There is no check on ID when people enrol in our electoral system. My daughter, who is well over 18, changed her residence and was eligible for enrolment in the very marginal seat of North Shore in New South Wales. I asked her if she was on the roll and she replied that she was not. I then went through the enrolment process with her. She picked up the forms and filled them out but at no point in the process was she required to prove in any way who she was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a person who was greatly concerned about the last election in 1993&mdash;so concerned that that person carried out some tests on the integrity of the roll by actually enrolling in five different seats. This was not picked up in any way in the system because the way the Electoral Commission handles this matter is that, if you enrol with no proof of who you are, it sends a confirmation letter out to the address that you have listed as your place of residence. If the letter does not come back, the commission assumes that you live there and that you are validly enrolled and it leaves you on the roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All people have to do is set up this little system with a friend in that particular seat. This is what we believe&mdash;and we have evidence&mdash;happens on a fairly widespread basis. When the letter comes, the person who knows about what is happening just does not return it. What does the Electoral Office do? It just leaves them on the roll and that person can turn up in the incorrect electorate, the electorate they do not live in, and vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stage is where you turn up in the electoral booth to vote. What is the question they ask you? They say, `Have you voted today?' They do not ask you who you are. They do not ask for proof. They ask, `Have you voted today?' Most people say, `No.' One lady told me she went up to one of the polling clerks and said, `Yes, I've voted 20 times today.' The polling clerk was a little perplexed and taken aback but still handed her the ballot-paper&mdash;no questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way in which the system has been loosened which challenges the integrity of the roll is the move from having votes in subdivisions to allowing people to vote anywhere in the electorate. In theory, you could wander around to all the 50 booths in your electorate and vote in each of them. I would not have to say that I was John Tierney. I do not have to put any proof in, do I, at any point in time? I could say I was Paul Calvert, for example, and they would not require me to prove otherwise. So when the commission gets these 50 votes that I have put in under the name of Paul Calvert, it will then challenge him and he will say, `That is a nonsense.' I am trying to illustrate with those two stories how open to abuse the system is in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC has staff who go and check to see if people live in particular areas, and it does what are called roll cleanses. The government has made this process even more difficult for the commission in recent years by cutting back on staff. So, whereas these electoral offices used to have three people, they now have about 2.2 people and they can use the 0.2 in times of higher demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the 1993 election, 6,000 cases of voter identification and address irregularities were admitted to the joint committee. How many people have been prosecuted? How significant are the 6,000 votes that are admitted? The election was lost by only 1,500 votes across about 13 seats, so the change in those votes could lead to a very different outcome in the federal election. The limp excuse given by the AEC about this violation of the roll's integrity was that there was insufficient proof and the cases were too expensive to solve. That is not good enough when a very small number of seats and a very small number of votes in each of those seats can actually change the outcome of the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the best ways in which we can solve this problem quite easily is to improve voter identification both at the point of enrolment and at the point of voting. The present system is unbelievable in a society in which virtually anything that you do in terms of establishing your name in some sort of system or organisation requires proof of who you are. My 13-year-old daughter recently went to a bank to set up a small bank account. She had to come up with a hundred points of identification to prove who she was in order to open the account, yet the electoral system does not require that sort of proof. It does not require any proof at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the coalition has advocated, particularly through the joint committee report which has looked at the whole electoral issue, is that we should trial voter ID cards. Another thing we should do is introduce subdivisional enrolment to minimise the multiple voting issue. </PARA>

There are plenty of ways in which you could provide proof, yet when we get to our electoral system we do not require any proof at all. I would like to see a government senator get up and justify that system. The government is leaving it wide open to abuse. Justice in a system must not only be done; it must be seen to be done. It is not going to be seen to be done if the system is left so wide open to fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what happened in the last election with this particular problem. I have indicated that it is so easy with a small group of people organising things in a certain way to have the election result changed. How many votes does it take to change the outcome in a seat? In the seat of Bass it took 30 votes; in Page, 100 votes; in Macquarie, 167 votes; and so it goes on around Australia, with just a few hundred votes changing the outcome in each seat and then changing the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that needs strengthening in the Electoral Act, and in our system as a whole, relates to the processes that lead up to the election. Particularly, in the case of the 1993 election, the government developed a series of ads that were totally and blatantly untrue. If this were done by some other organisation or company, many of them would find themselves in court or certainly on the program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investigators</EMPHASIS> because what they were doing was so incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had cases where people were actually sent bogus electricity bills which showed the supposed effect of the 15 per cent GST, by adding that amount to the bill. Obviously, on any simple understanding of that proposal there would be a whole lot of cost drops and the bill would not go up by that amount. That was just one example out of thousands of examples of misleading advertising around the whole country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major problems with our electoral system. It was most disappointing, having carried out a review over 18 months, having heard from witnesses right around Australia and from the Electoral Commission, that there was very little, apart from tinkering at the edges, that the government was prepared to change in relation to the Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major reform is needed but every time a reform was proposed&mdash;about 40 major reforms were proposed&mdash;the Australian Electoral Commission took the attitude that they were all too difficult and hard. As a matter of fact, they produced a document for the committee in which they put down 40 different changes that could be made to the Electoral Act to strengthen and improve it. Under each one, they listed all the reasons why it could not be done; why it was not desirable. In other words, they wanted to keep the act exactly as it was. The outcome of that is an act that is totally open to abuse and one which can change who is governing the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not acceptable. We ask the government to again consider the contents of the minority report in relation to the reform of elections in Australia. Seriously, I do not expect the government to look at these matters and act on them. The system as it exists at the moment suits this government right down to the ground. The system can be rorted on the margins. It can be used to help the government win federal elections. It is regrettable that we will have to wait until we are in government next year to introduce a proper electoral amendment act containing reforms which will not only improve the system but also improve the integrity of the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief comments on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1995. I welcome the recognition that this bill gives to the Senate. The bill provides an equal degree of funding for each Senate vote. This situation already applies to the House of Representatives vote. I always thought that that was an anomaly and was something which did not give the appropriate regard to the Senate. I am pleased to see that that has now been rectified and I welcome that amendment to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect that I wish to address is the more realistic approach to accountability in relation to fund raising by political parties. Prior to coming into this place I was state president of the Liberal Party in my home state of Tasmania. I recall going to seminars arranged by the Australian Electoral Commission which explained how the new disclosure rules would apply and the very strict rules that would be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was simply beyond the realms of what the normal volunteer would seek to do in relation to, say, having a barbecue that might raise $500. In that event, the organiser would need full accountability of how much was spent at the butcher shop, how much was spent at the bakery for the bread and how much was spent at the local bottle shop for the alcohol. You then had to tick off the names of everybody who paid money and indicate how you came to the end result. You then had to have all that up at party headquarters ready for an audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of volunteers simply found that to be frightening as well as a lot of hard work. It was of no real benefit because at the end of the day those sorts of party functions would raise only a couple of thousand dollars at the most. I could never see the reason or rationale for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the reason for public disclosure is to try to overcome the corruption within the political process by money being handed over for certain policy changes or for certain political actions. Quite frankly, I would have thought that anybody who was in the game of bribing politicians or who was wanting to effect certain outcomes with money would not be spending that money at a branch barbecue and trying to influence policy or direction in that area. Indeed, it has been my view that those who engage in that sort of grubby activity within politics would not be channelling their money through the political party process but would undoubtedly be channelling it through brown paper bags, or in other ways, to individuals and not to the actual party administration where it would be receipted into the accounts and could be traced in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still remember asking questions at this forum put on by the Australian Electoral Commission as to the impact of those new disclosure rules. I also recall our former state director, who was a former manager of BP within my own home state of Tasmania, having to put in the return. He had some expertise in bookkeeping and accounting and in being able to prepare financial reports. It really was a major trauma for the Liberal Party within my state&mdash;for the state director and for myself&mdash;to abide by the disclosure laws that had been previously set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relaxation that now is to apply is to be welcomed. I think it is more realistic. What occurred previously I think was trying to crack a nut with a sledgehammer. Undoubtedly the Australian Labor Party found the same difficulties when its rank and file were trying to raise a bit of money through the odd raffle, barbecue or dinner. The amendments that have now been made I think are more realistic, more appropriate, and will allow those genuine volunteers&mdash;the thousands of them within all the parties around Australia&mdash;to get on with the activity again of trying to raise money for their political parties and for the causes in which they believe so passionately. In the past the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act really were a great disincentive for people from all parties and of all political persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that I wish to address relates to seeking to determine where the actual capital sums came from that are in trust funds. I understand that there will be an amendment during the committee stage to ensure that there is no retrospectivity in relation to that. If that is the case, I welcome it. I look forward to the committee stage to see whether that eventuates. I trust that it will, because it is only fair that those people who donated money to a trust fund, possibly people who are now deceased, should not have their names brought up in public 30 or 50 years after they may have made a contribution on the basis that the law would not require their names to be disclosed. If these amendments now come through, then those people who give in the future will of course be on notice that their names may be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly turn to one criticism of the legislation regarding the requirement for donors to lodge their returns each year when they donate over $1,500. I would have thought, given the reporting conditions required anyway under this legislation to put an onus on a donor to also report but on an annual basis, that that is somewhat onerous and that it will once again militate against people who wish to make small and modest donations to the political party of their choice. I would have thought in general terms that would affect mainly the Liberal Party, the National Party and, I would also assume, the Greens and the Australian Democrats because we are the parties who usually get funding from smaller-type donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, just by way of example, that in 1993 the trade union movement gave the Labor Party $2.1 million. In addition, individual unions acting as third parties spent significant additional amounts on election-related advertising. I quote from research paper No. 21 of 1994-95 headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Election funding disclosure and Australian politics: debunking some myths</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, unlike previously&mdash;and this still occurs&mdash;that the trade union movement will not have such onerous responsibilities in relation to disclosure. It can simply make a donation and that then will be where the inquiry will stop. Nobody looks behind to see how many trade union members actually signed up or how the trade union got the money to be able to give it to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that they do not, there may be some difficulties with the Australian Electoral Commission. The chances are that in the future they will say that it is all too hard, it is all too difficult, why bother or they will reduce the donation size to below $1,500 per annum. So that aspect is still designed to scare off the small contributors to the political parties. At the end of the day, the survival of the political parties is on the basis of the support they get from within the community and from individual electors and small businesses and enterprises who believe in a particular cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the government has not addressed this matter in a more appropriate way to ensure some degree of equity. In relation to these donations, if the Liberal Party were to have a front of some organisation&mdash;let us say the Kemp foundation&mdash;where we could all donate money to and then the Kemp foundation gave the money to the Liberal Party, the Australian Electoral Commission would look behind the Kemp foundation to ascertain who had been funding the Kemp foundation. But no such rule applies when a trade union gives money to the Australian Labor Party. There is an inequity in relation to that within the legislation and it indicates once again this government's unacceptable favouritism towards the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are dealing with the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and legislation and amendments pursuant to that act, we ought to have principles applied equally across-the-board so that we play on a level playing field and do not continually amend the legislation to seek to hurt the cause of one side or the other for political advantage. I believe the previous amendments in relation to disclosure were clearly designed to hurt the Liberal Party and the National Party. I think it came back to haunt the Australian Labor Party as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1995 gives effect to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters by proposing numerous amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. As my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) observed in the House, the June 1994 interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was very important because it was the first time since 1984&mdash;when the present government first introduced electoral funding into federal legislation&mdash;that the process had been reviewed in some detail by an appropriate committee of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS>, recommended that section 294 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that the same amount of public funding is payable for a Senate vote as for a House of Representatives vote. The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended as necessary so that $500 is set as the threshold for  disclosure of individual amounts received and paid by or on behalf of political parties. These recommendations have been given effect in the bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite our opposition to the retrospective element it contains, the coalition supports the basic thrust of the bill for a number of reasons. As my colleagues observed earlier in this debate, it will make reporting much simpler for political parties. Intricate details of financial transactions and annual returns will not have to be reported by registered political parties. For example, under the old rules, the annual return of a political party was required to include a list of bank interest received by every individual branch or committee, even if the amount earned by a branch or committee was just a few cents. Fundraising events such as small raffles or afternoon tea parties needed to be reported on in detail with both proceeds and expenses listed. Anything less than such a detailed reporting could render party members liable to quite draconian action under the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of branches and committees in political parties across Australia. Expecting ordinary Australian men and women from essentially a voluntary organisational structure to face such onerous political and legal risk is quite unreasonable and at last the government seems to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of those who donate individual amounts of less than $500 now do not have to be disclosed. There are corresponding requirements in relation to payments. Donors of gifts of $500 or more, totalling $1,500 or more in any financial year, will have to be disclosed in the annual return of a political party. Donors of gifts to a political party which total $1,500 or more during a financial year must themselves lodge an annual return. The effect of this amendment is to require dual reporting of donations by having donors' returns cover the same time frames as party returns. We are at a loss to understand the public benefit of such duplication. These donors will have had details of their donations disclosed by the relevant political party and then find themselves obliged to undertake the purely administrative task of lodging a return themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the rate of election funding reimbursement will be amended so that a Senate vote will be funded at the same rate as a House of Representatives vote. This rate will be increased to $1.50 per formal first preference vote, indexed each six months to rise in the CPI. Based on the payments made to the 1993 election, the charges will provide an extra $14 million of public funding for registered political parties and entitled candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged by all parties that the disclosure provisions under this act have significantly affected the willingness of individuals and organisations in the community to contribute to political parties. I thought my colleague Senator Abetz expressed it rather well when he said that the original efforts by the government to amend the act were designed to affect the Liberal Party and its traditional sources of funding. It turned out that it also affected the Labor Party. There are concerns with the disclosure provisions, which is one of the reasons why it has become increasingly difficult to raise voluntary contributions to party funds. </PARA>

It is just another example of the low level to which Mr Keating has brought public life in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also concern about the issues of privacy. Many people would be happy to contribute to political parties but, for perfectly proper reasons, are unwilling to see their names bandied around in public documents. Other factors which have affected the funding for political parties include the recession that Mr Keating said we had to have. Cash flows of companies are still being rebuilt in many cases and contributions to political parties are, quite frankly, not the first priority. Finally, increasing foreign ownership in this country has made some companies less likely to contribute to domestic political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, significant funds of money are required to fund the operation of political parties to maintain balance and competition in a democracy. Both the ALP and the Liberal Party, and indeed the National Party, receive money from corporations. The Labor Party is also the beneficiary of funds from the trade union movement. In the old days, the Labor Party was happy to describe itself as the political arm of the trade union movement.

Payments of election funding entitlements will be able to be made to the national secretariat of a registered political party with the agreement of the state body. The amendments will also enable a party agent to request that an amendment be made to a claim or return. Under the legislation as it currently stands, only the person who finished the claim or return can have that claim or return amended. The amendments also specify that organisations such as trust funds which are closely related to political parties will be required to furnish annual reports to the Australian Electoral Commission. They will also be required to detail the source of capital contributed even before the date of effect of this amendment where income derived has been used wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, as my colleagues have mentioned, believes the retrospective element in the provision relating to annual returns of associated entities, as they are called, will require details of the source of capital, even though that capital was contributed when there was no question of disclosure. Contributions of capital made years ago, when disclosure was not an issue, were made under completely different rules. It is grossly unfair to require details of these donors, some of whom may well be deceased, to be made public under a new and unnecessary law. The amendment we propose will address this issue. It removes the need for disclosure of capital contributed prior to the date of effect of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 March 1995, the government moved a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, including some relating to the payment of political parties after an election.

It was brought rapidly into the House of Representatives; and we are now dealing with it in the Senate. </PARA>

This amendment will prevent the present situation in which the payment of public funding arrives long after an election, because of the highly detailed claims which are required. While waiting for election funding to come through, parties often have to pay election expenses and rely on bank overdrafts, incurring the costs that involves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although, as a result of this bill, there is some lessening of the burden of detailed disclosure required of registered political parties, it should be noted that the bill does not reduce other impacts of the existing disclosure law; and the basic thrust of the original legislation remains.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to add to what Senator Kemp has said. The problems for the Australian Democrats are considerable because we are a totally voluntary party, with very few exceptions. Some of the very onerous requirements that have been placed on our branch officers, branch treasurers in particular, and transferred through to state level to members of the executive, have led to there being a lack of volunteers for some of the very critical work of raising money in the first place and then accounting for it in great detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will still have to be done in that we will still have annual returns to furnish. But the minuscule detail of accounting for who is buying raffle tickets, who is buying goods at an auction sale or who has been attending functions, to the point of tracking through a dollar here and $3 there, has been very onerous. It has been difficult to add up all those amounts. So the Democrats will be supporting the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1995. We have a strong and enduring policy commitment towards transparency in electoral funding. We demonstrated that commitment in our original support, amid some controversy, for financial disclosure and reporting by political parties. </PARA>

We have not been able to gain the kind of widespread debate which we believe such a change in policy deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look first at the bill. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 9 November 1994. It was brought on for debate in the other place on 9 March 1995. On the morning of the debate being brought on in the House of Representatives&mdash;something like 35 minutes before the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker)&mdash;the government circulated amendments which do several things. It changed the name of the bill from the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, it changed the way that payments were to be made to registered political parties. These changes increased the costs of the public funding of elections, which are imposed on the Australian taxpayer, by over $15 million per year to nearly $30 million each election. These figures are based on the votes in the last federal election. It was really interesting that, following these fairly dramatic changes in policy, three weeks later the government put on the bill&mdash;I believe that there was some concord in the Senate&mdash;a motion to allow us to debate and pass it. Fortunately, because of the other matters on the program and our failure to reach that point, we have had some additional time to provide more public scrutiny and to have an opportunity for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter has been taken back to the Greens (WA). But because it has been a fairly small time since those amendments were raised in March and the groups work at a local group level, it has been fairly difficult to reach a consensus. However, there are some matters on which we are very concerned. We want to put on the record our disagreement with the way in which this matter has been handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very misleading for any members of this chamber to believe that all the measures in the bill were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am a member of that committee. Several of my colleagues who have already spoken are also members of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain matters were put to the government in a report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. They were responded to by the government following our report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Reporting by Political Parties</EMPHASIS>. Most recommendations of that report were agreed to by the government. One recommendation of relevance was that the same amount of public funding be payable for a Senate vote as for a House of Representatives vote. In the past the funding payable for each vote was unequal, being 50c per Senate vote and $1 for a House of Representatives vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee felt there was no need for this discrepancy. The Greens supported this change because Senate campaigns, which often have to reach across a large area of the country, involve an equal or greater difficulty in reaching the community as a House of Representatives campaign. An equivalent vote rebate between the House of Representatives and the Senate is not a problem. That was a recommendation of the committee. However, no particular amount was set. Whether it was to be equalised to 50c per vote or $1 per vote was not an issue. We believe there is no reason in principle why the Senate vote should be half the amount of the House of Representatives. Thus, the Greens (WA) supported that particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seeing minor parties stand a greater chance of success in the Senate and are thus more likely to stand Senate candidates, there is good reason to support it in the interests of both diversity and democracy. We did not at the time realise that two other changes would occur. First, in order to make the House of Representatives feel that it was not being ignored as a result of the Senate having its vote rebate doubled, the amount was increased to $1.50 for both chambers. That not only addressed the recommendation of equality in the report but also increased the amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this matter should be questioned. It needs a bit of research. There should be research into the amount that major parties spend on general elections. It seems reasonable to support an increase in the dollar per vote in accordance with the principles of relating it to CPI increases and expenditure keeping up with inflation. Our understanding is that this increase takes that into account as well. We should be checking whether the increase in the amount can be justified in terms of its impact on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The main concern I am expressing here is that although the normal process for changing the way in which public funding and the funding disclosure provisions is for recommendations to come via the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, this was not the case with the changes in this bill. The amendments to the bill referring to public funding which the government moved in March were not recommended by the joint committee. My understanding is that they were part of a private deal which appeared to be engineered by the Federal Secretary of the ALP and agreed to in letters to the Minister for Administrative Services from the Liberals, the Nationals and the Democrats. That is what I was informed, but they may wish to verify this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that was the mechanism of the arrangement because I was asked to sign that letter and was informed that all the other parties had signed it. I refused when approached to do so. I believe there is a concern that needs to be addressed; that is, the public is not aware that all the political parties&mdash;and the Greens are no exception&mdash;will become enormous beneficiaries of this legislation. I am searching through my notes to find a very interesting table which indicates the kind of windfall that we should all be expressing extreme gratitude for if we base our public funding expectations on the votes that we gained in our last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I would not like to see any of this matter that is under debate related to preference distributions either. I would be very loathe to see anything like that occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the principle of public funding to encourage democracy and to encourage political parties not to be subject to pressure from big financial donations. However, this bill actually increases public funding and increases the accountability and transparency of funding disclosures. It certainly brings about changes that are very different from the past policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Electoral Act the rule has been that political parties would gain a rebate for all their campaign expenses, or on the number of votes they received according to the 50c and $1 per vote public funding calculation, whichever is less. The dramatic change at this point in the legislation is that the political parties will get it up front anyway regardless of their campaign expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read the amounts that we would hope to get if we maintain our present level of support. In the federal election on 13 March, the ALP would have been able to receive $7,098,642 on the basis of their vote; the Liberal-National Party coalition $6,971,722; the Australian Democrats $459,815; the Greens (WA) $65,886; and Independents $63,855. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody is going to have at least a doubling of their funding. I will now start from the smaller amounts and use round figures. The Independents' vote, which would have led to the $63,000, can expect to be doubled with this bill to $123,000. The Greens (WA), instead of their $65,000, can expect $164,000. The Australian Democrats, as opposed to their $460,000 or more, can expect $1,446,000; and the Liberal-National Party coalition can expect to get nearly $14 million rather than $7 million as can the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that we can just push through this chamber legislation which allows an extra cost of $15 million minimum to the taxpayer without explaining that we are now funding political parties on the basis of their popularity rather than on the basis of the expenditure incurred during campaigns by those political parties. This is a matter of concern&mdash;it has been raised with me that the Greens in other parts of Australia, not just the Greens (WA), are concerned about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) did consider asking me to put up an amendment that if it is going to put an emphasis on public funding, then we should be fair to everybody and drop the threshold from four per cent to two per cent of the vote for parties that would receive this kind of public funding support because that would be in the democratic interests of the community. Of course, that would add to the expenditure we would be asking from the community at large and from the public purse&mdash;something that has to be taken into consideration very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Greens communicated with me expressing their grave concern that this kind of increase in funding which is being pushed through the Senate could actually communicate to the public an extreme cynicism. For example, the land fund took many hours of debate and in the end provided only $24 million a year extra funding for land acquisition and management to redress the injustice of 200 years of white settlement in Australia. Yet we can push through an increase of over $15 million for each election with the minimum of fuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also am making a minimum of fuss. I realise that the Greens' vote will not change this situation, that we will be the happy beneficiaries of something we will be voting against, but there is a principle involved&mdash;that where a change in policy directly affects the public purse it should have the kind of exposure that will allow the public to decide whether it is a good or a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By making this token protest, the Greens are saying that our proposal to return funding to its original base of campaign expenses rather than the popularity of a political party raises the issue and gives the chamber the opportunity to discuss it. We are also expressing the views of those people within and outside the Greens who feel that it should not be so easy for political parties to get together and give themselves the kind of windfall that we see in the legislation today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I wish to make some comments in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1995. The changes that have been proposed are the result of debate surrounding the financial disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act and the hearings that were held last year by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems experienced by the parties and their grassroots members because of the existing disclosure provisions needed to be addressed. Clearly, if the concept of disclosure is to be a major part of our electoral legislation, we must make sure that disclosure is workable and reasonable. The public needs to know about the substantial donations, not the day-to-day expenses of the parties or a particular branch of a party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure to comply should be directed far more at the state and federal party administrators rather than the sub-branch treasurer. Volunteer party workers do not deserve to be placed under the degree of stress that they have been. The simplification of the process was supported by the committee and I am glad that it will be incorporated into the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public funding is also dealt with in this bill and is an important element of it. The fact that we are encouraging democracy to be less reliant on donations from outside sources should be seen as strengthening our democracy rather than draining the public purse. Connecting funding to the results of a party and ensuring payment is swift are fair principles for us to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual amount of funding represents a need to recognise the increasing costs of electoral activity and, of importance to the Senate, the fact that a Senate vote is of the same value as a House of Representatives vote. I see this as an important recognition of the fact that costs incurred by minor parties are also significant. Like the ALP, minor parties cannot hope for massive donations from corporations. Indeed, $100,000 donations from overseas do not come along too often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplification of the disclosure provisions do not weaken the thrust of the original commitment to disclosure. In fact, the changes to get rid of loopholes will make the legislation much tougher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money kept in trust funds, such as the Liberal Party's Free Enterprise Foundation and the National Party's John McEwen House Pty Ltd, must now be disclosed. Just as tax evasion undermines the fairness of our society, disclosure evasion undermines our democracy. This government is committed to a system where any donation that has any connection with a political party or an electoral outcome must be there for the public to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia we see a Liberal government giving projects to companies which have made donations. We also see overseas donations from donors of no fixed address. At least with financial disclosure we can see these connections and bring them to the attention of the public. Who knows what other secrets will be discovered when this legislation comes into effect. It is time for the spirit of disclosure provisions to be restored. I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

Today during lunchtime we are discussing a non-controversial bill, the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, and it is a sign of the coalition's goodwill that we do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will remind the government that its legislative program is in a mess, firstly, because it is not able to control the amount of legislation that it puts through this place; and, secondly, because the legislation that comes in is so often in a form which requires amendment afterwards. When Senator Ray was running government business we did not seem to have such a mess. My cry would be, `Bring back Senator Ray to organise government business,' because the state of the program for this session is in an appalling mess. When you look at the number of bills that are supposed to go through here between now and when we rise, it is a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a joke that this bill has taken so long to come before the house. I prepared this speech so long ago that I actually thought I had given it, and I had to go back through the records to check. I think I have come into the chamber a couple of times armed with this speech, ready to give it. I have looked at it so many times in getting ready for it that I was convinced I had given the speech. That might say something about what is happening to my brain while I am in this place; it might also say a lot about the government's management of business and legislation in this house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today&mdash;with the goodwill of the coalition and the Democrats, who will be speaking later&mdash;we are debating the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This bill amends the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the consequential amendments to the Social Security Act 1991. It implements legislative requirements of the reforms the Child Support Agency announced in April 1994 by the Assistant Treasurer, so it is implementing an announcement made in April 1994. That shows how swift of foot this government is!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this bill will expand presumptions of parentage and require social security clients wishing to enter into private maintenance agreements to have those agreements assessed for adequacy under the reasonable action for maintenance provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. It will enable the child support registrar not to enforce court ordered support in some circumstances and extend the circumstances in which social security clients can opt to make arrangements for private collection of support payments. The amendments contained in this bill will provide some relief to some clients of the Child Support Agency. For this reason, the coalition is not opposing the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to speak for a few minutes about the deficiencies in the operation of the child support scheme. Before I do that, I want to emphasise that the coalition supports the child support scheme and the principles underlying it. By way of background, the child support scheme was established in response to concerns that so many non-custodial parents were not paying to support their children. The burden for supporting these children was then falling on the social security system and, ultimately, the taxpayer. There was also concern about the adequacy of court ordered child maintenance and the difficulties which existed in the enforcement and collection of maintenance in Australia. The child support scheme has had a number of successes and, when we think back to the situation before the child support scheme, there is little doubt that what we now have is an improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total amount of child support which has been paid through the Child Support Agency demonstrates the significance of the scheme. Since 1 July 1988 to May 1994, a total of $825.7 million had been collected by the agency. This means that the scheme has saved the Department of Social Security and, hence, the taxpayer a very large amount of money&mdash;$161 million in 1993-94 alone&mdash;although, because of the burgeoning administration costs, the net savings have not been as high as were initially predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest success of the child support scheme is not the amount of money collected but the shift in community attitude. Before the introduction of the child support legislation in 1988-89, debate centred around the extent to which parents should support their own children compared with the responsibility of the community to do so through social welfare and whether it was possible to introduce a formula for the calculation of child support liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now an acknowledgment by the vast majority of the community that it is the primary responsibility of parents to support their own children and that the support of children in our community involves very high costs. To a large extent this shift has resulted from enforcing the collection of child support through the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, we should not get carried away with the successes of the scheme. These achievements should not overshadow the very significant problems and deficiencies that have become apparent in the scheme. Whilst the concept underlying the scheme is admirable, in practice the system has resulted in a deluge of complaints from custodial and non-custodial parents and from the subsequent spouses of non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the staff in our offices had the opportunity to speak in the chamber, they would attest to the number of telephone calls that come into our offices with complaints about the Child Support Agency. Complaints range from the fact that they cannot get through to complaints about money being lodged and then not being passed on to them. There is a never ending procession. You can list on your hand the sorts of issues that come into your office and you can bet your bottom dollar that there is a high likelihood when somebody rings up that it is going to be about the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an exaggeration to state that dissatisfaction with the operation of the scheme and its implementation through the Child Support Agency is unprecedented both in its intensity and in its quantity. This had to be borne out by the 6,000 or so submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues which conducted an inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the child support scheme. People often intend to write a submission but they do not get around to it. To have 6,000 submissions attests to the fact that there are problems and people have concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the joint select committee was tabled in November 1994. It is a scathing indictment of the government's failure to recognise and remedy the obvious problems of the child support scheme. It is an extraordinary arraignment of the chronic administrative problems of the Child Support Agency. The explanatory memorandum to the Child Support Assessment Bill 1989, dated 6 September 1989, stated that the bill was intended to establish a system which ensures that `access to child support is simple, timely and flexible and respects personal privacy'. It is now acknowledged that, by these criteria or any others, there are serious inadequacies in the administration, as well as structural anomalies and deficiencies in the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, two criticisms have emerged. There are those directed at the Child Support Agency itself and those which criticised the operation of the scheme; in particular, the formula applied to assess a non-custodial parent's liability for child support. To begin with, a high proportion of custodians do not receive any, or very little, child support yet there is no reliable detailed information as to why this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, all members of parliament have had dealings over a number of years with constituents who have had difficulties with some of the provisions of the scheme and in their dealings with the Child Support Agency. As the joint select committee report points out, this indicates that the government should have been more aware of the urgent need for change and action within the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to skim through the joint select committee report to appreciate the magnitude of the deficiencies in the operation of the child support scheme. I will note a few of the problems mentioned: the legislation itself is convoluted, complex and difficult to interpret; the Child Support Agency has chronic administrative problems and the main reason for this is the consistent failure of the CSA's management to identify and rectify its own poor administrative and management practices. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consistency of the types of complaints documented in the Ombudsman's Annual Reports from 1989-90 through to 1993-94 demonstrate that the CSA's management did not recognise and failed to accept responsibility for delivering an efficient and effective service to its clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another complaint was that there was a lack of national direction in the management of the Child Support Agency. There were complaints about deficiencies in national policies and guidelines, a failure to enforce consistent national practice, poor administrative practices at local branch level, communication problems, inconsistent advice, administrative errors, refusal to verify data, delay in action, appalling client service delivery, and a failure to give full effect to people's rights and entitlements under the legislation. Other complaints included claims that the existing branch office organisation provides poor accessibility to clients outside capital cities and a failure to meet the information needs of clients. There is a complaint that the Child Support Agency is insensitive and unresponsive to complaints raised by clients. The Commonwealth ombudsman, the child support evaluation advisory group and the Australian National Audit Office have all commented on difficulties in communicating with the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been suggestions that Child Support Agency staff do not adequately understand the requirements of the Privacy Act and have disclosed personal information without authorisation. That is totally unacceptable, especially given the sensitivity of the relationships that are involved in cases dealt with by the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child Support Agency staff have interpreted court orders incorrectly and have incorrectly registered applications to courts. That is totally unacceptable. There has been a lack of support from the Australian Taxation Office, the host department of the Child Support Agency&mdash;support which should have been there from the beginning. There has been a lack of dedicated and identifiable contact officers responsible for the administration for a particular case or client. There have been long delays between registration and receipt of the first payment. There has been delay or failure to recover arrears. No action to collect arrears has been taken until the debt reaches a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Setting aside whether the agency should be making judgment about what is wrong to warrant an effort to collect arrears, the real point is that the longer the arrears are allowed to accumulate the less likely full recovery becomes. The list goes on. This is an indictment of this government and its ability to organise anything. If this were a report by a company to its shareholders about the management of an organisation a lot of heads would roll. These are people&mdash;mostly women, but in a lot of cases they are husbands, male spouses or partners&mdash;who are being subjected to this sort of treatment, and it has gone on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done nothing about it. This bill has been listed over and over again in this place. That shows that the government does not have a great desire to do much about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We tend to forget that there are real people at the end of the process. We have to remember the woman who is trying to work in a factory and who goes to the telephone over and over again to ring the Child Support Agency and cannot get through. That is what is happening. These are people who have to ask permission to use the telephone. Many of them cannot do that easily. Then they cannot get through to the Child Support Agency. If they get through, they are often told to ring back, or they cannot get on to the person that they were last dealing with. That is the nitty-gritty of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget that there are people at the end. We must also remember the person who has put money into the Child Support Agency but who cannot find out why it has not been paid. The committee's report should not have been used. The Child Support Agency has been under fire for many years. Criticisms have come from the Commonwealth ombudsman, the Auditor-General, the parliament and the many support groups that exist to help clients who have been poorly treated by the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it is totally unacceptable that this government and the Child Support Agency have not been able to rectify these inadequacies. It is even more appalling that these problems are only beginning to be addressed now because of the JSC inquiry and report. Even so, government ministers are arguing amongst themselves about the report's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will say that the government has acted on a number of occasions to improve the child support scheme. It is true that there have been attempts to tinker at the edge of the scheme but, from the report and from constituent responses, we know that this has not been adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 that we are debating today is yet another attempt to fix the mess, but, once again, it does not attempt to deal with the major problems with the scheme and with the Child Support Agency.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, when the government gets around to responding to the report of the joint select committee, there will be a comprehensive overhaul of the legislation. I note that an interim government response is being tabled this afternoon. I will be interested to see that response, but, as I said, it is only an interim response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. However, we have a number of concerns which need to be mentioned. This legislation proposes changes that will give the Child Support Agency staff greater discretionary powers. In theory, this is a step in the right direction, but, given the appalling record of the Child Support Agency, the high number of complaints to the ombudsman and the findings of the Auditor-General and the joint select committee, it is questionable that agency staff have the skills to make the sensitive and responsible decisions that their work entails. I hope that situation is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must make sure that officers of the Child Support Agency are up to the job if this legislation is to be delivered and if the desired results are to be obtained. Staff of the Child Support Agency will need comprehensive training to effectively manage the issues and the additional responsibilities that this legislation raises. The problem is that the legislation does not provide for such training; it merely adds to the burden of those struggling with the impossible task of making the legislation work. Giving more work to those who are already not coping is not a solution. As I already said, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in 1986, well before the child support scheme began, Janine Haines, who was then the leader of the Democrats, gave a speech in this chamber in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worthwhile for us to remember that our primary concern about the breakdown of a marriage from which there have been children is that those children are adequately supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, we get rather excited about other issues resulting from the breakdown of a marriage, including relationships between the parents, problems with access, the damage that one parent can do by bad-mouthing the other, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing that, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that the most relevant factor is the welfare and wellbeing of the children of the union.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what Janine Haines, in 1986, wanted to see from a child support scheme: a scheme which had, as its first and foremost concern, the welfare and wellbeing of the children of marriages which had broken down. That is exactly what the child support scheme has delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that anyone can deny the value of or, indeed, the success of this scheme. I do not think that anyone can deny that the child support scheme is, at heart, an effective and sound scheme which has delivered good results. In other words, it is one scheme which has really made a difference. Many Australian children undoubtedly have a better quality of life and a higher standard of living thanks to the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as significantly, the scheme has challenged the attitude that maintenance payments are voluntary and that non-custodial parents are not obliged to support their children. That attitude has changed, and it is understood that non-custodial parents do, indeed, have a real obligation. It is also understood that their obligation is not to be an afterthought after other expenses have been met, but that it is to be the primary obligation of the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, it is no longer considered acceptable for non-custodial parents to simply wash their hands of their duty to support their children. Australians now expect the responsibility of child maintenance to be shared by both parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this does not mean by any stretch of the imagination that the child support scheme is now perfect. As the recent report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues shows very clearly, there is still a large number of problems with the child support scheme. There is still an enormous number of custodial parents who either receive no child support from their former partners or who struggle to obtain child support regularly. There is still an enormous number of parents who remain outside the scheme, and the level of arrears remains unacceptably very high. There is still a great deal of dissatisfaction&mdash;a lot of it justified&mdash;with the operation of the scheme and with the conduct of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems are not surprising. The child support scheme is fraught with difficulty. The nature of divorce and family breakdown means that the scheme operates in an emotionally charged climate in which people do not always behave sensibly, calmly or with patience and maturity. Right from the start the scheme was always going to be out there in the front line. It was always going to cop more than its fair share of criticism. While some of that criticism is justified, quite clearly some of it is driven by very real personal anger and frustration, rather than by any truly valid criticism of the scheme itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements the reforms of the Child Support Agency announced in April last year by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). It aims to provide more flexibility in the child support scheme. I want to cover four main areas very briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major change in the bill is the aligning of the child support legislation with the provisions of the Family Law Act in relation to the establishment of parentage in the first place. The object of this alignment is to broaden the range of circumstances under which clients of the Child Support Agency can lodge an initial application. Hopefully, this will speed up the processing of their applications, which is a desirable outcome given the joint committee's finding that significant delays are still occurring between the date of application and the receipt of the first payment for child support. The delay period has been an ongoing problem since the scheme began and anything the government can do to facilitate the processing of this application is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change is to ensure that DSS clients who enter into an agreement will now have to have that agreement examined for its adequacy under the reasonable action for maintenance provisions of the Social Security Act. This change has come about because of growing evidence that child support agreements are being drawn up for amounts which are substantially less than would be payable under a formula assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third change is aimed at building some flexibility into the situation where parents want to alter their child support agreement because the non-custodial parent's income has fallen below a critical level. The bill enables the agency to exercise some discretion in enforcing child support liability ordered by the Family Court and registered under the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth change proposed by the legislation is an amendment which will allow Social Security clients the option of receiving payments through either the Child Support Agency or by way of private agreement and arrangements. At present, some parents who are receiving income tested payments from DSS can elect to collect child support privately when they register with the agency. A significant number of custodial parents make that election and the agency only becomes involved when the private payment arrangement fails. However, once they are registered for collection with the agency, a custodial parent cannot revert back to a private arrangement at a later date. The change in the bill will enable all custodial parents in receipt of an income tested payment from DSS to choose private collection at any time after registration, provided the payer has a satisfactory payment record. If the private arrangement fails, once again the custodial parent will be able to elect to have the liability enforced under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Democrats support the legislation. That support is consistent with our ongoing backing of the child support scheme. As I said earlier, that does not mean we do not have some concerns about the scheme. Senator Spindler was a member of the joint select committee and the Democrats, like most members and senators, are well aware of the shortcomings of the scheme and the administrative problems of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not agree with everything the joint committee said, I believe the committee has produced a comprehensive and important report against which the government actions on child support can be measured. I also think that it is fair to expect the government to at least indicate during the current parliamentary session what legislative action it intends to take in response to that committee's report. In short, the Democrats look forward to a comprehensive government response to the committee's report. In our view, anything less than that is unacceptable. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology representing the Treasurer. Two days ago the Commonwealth budget brought forward a major new initiative in terms of Australia's comprehensive national savings plan. Can the minister inform the Senate what the role of national savings in the Australian economy is? What is the impact of the government's initiatives in terms of national savings? How will workers directly benefit from those initiatives?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="294" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable senator on his question. The measures in this budget represent a two-part plan by the government to directly increase the amount of national savings. By increasing national savings, this plan will reduce the pressure on the current account deficit&mdash;something that everyone has been calling for&mdash;will reverse the accumulation of government debt and, significantly, will take pressure off interest rates. That is very good news for Australian business and particularly good news for Australian home buyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit is the result of the fact that as a nation we have been buying more than we have been selling and we have had too low a level of national savings. By saving more, we address this problem as well as securing a quality of life for Australians in their retirement. The nation's savings are made up of savings by the public sector and the private sector. This budget works on both those fronts. The budget increases public savings by bringing the Commonwealth budget into surplus, a surplus of $718 million, and a surplus achieved three years earlier than was previously expected. No-one has tried to deny that the asset sales make a significant contribution to the surplus outcome. That is on page 1 of the Treasurer's budget speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other points that I would like to note. Firstly, as the senior analyst for Moody's Investors Service said on radio this morning, `Going into surplus is a good idea no matter how it is achieved.' Proceeds from asset sales directly reduce the overall level of government borrowing. Secondly, the budget will be in surplus, even excluding asset sales of special debt and capital repayments in 1996-97 and increasing after that. The budget balance will be restored with revenue much lower in relation to GDP than in the past. When we last moved into surplus in 1987-88 revenue represented 27.2 per cent of GDP, compared with an estimated 25.3 per cent this year, 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to private sector savings, this budget implements Australia's first long-term private sector savings program through employee superannuation. The government will support the inclusion in all awards of provisions for employee superannuation contributions beginning at one per cent of earnings in July 1987 and rising to three per cent of earnings in July 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, employee contributions will be augmented through the payment of the second tranche of tax cuts directly into people's superannuation accounts. The government will match employee contributions dollar for dollar&mdash;a government contribution of $4 billion when fully phased in. This will do more for national savings than a straight tax cut would have done and it will be done in a way that increases equity in this country by the government's contribution to those earning less than $46,000. Moreover, it is estimated that the cost of the superannuation package will grow faster than the cost of the tax cuts it replaces, eventually exceeding the cost of the tax cuts. Middle and low income earners in Australia will be better off having their tax cuts paid in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures build on and reinforce the significant achievements of the government since 1983 in transforming the role of superannuation in Australia. I have said it before, but in the Liberal era less than 40 per cent of Australian workers had superannuation cover; today the proportion is nearly 90 per cent thanks to the changes we have made. In 1983 superannuation funds assets were $40 billion; they are now $180 billion and they are growing. That is a huge pool for national investment purposes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for her question. I did announce in the budget this week that the Australian Sports Drug Agency will receive increased funding of $3 million over the next six years. This funding will be used to implement additional testing, education and international anti-doping programs. This will further enhance the world leadership role that Australia enjoys in anti-doping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time I announced the increased funding, I made it clear that I am determined to do everything possible to ensure that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games is drug free. This will involve both continuing our excellent work here in Australia and advocating an international level playing field. The size of our olympic teams that will be competing at Atlanta and Sydney will be the largest ever. Additional drug tests will therefore be conducted to ensure that we maintain the strong deterrent effect we have already achieved here in Australia. This increased drug testing initiative will be supported through enhanced education programs which will particularly emphasise that drug use is cheating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research has shown that 50 per cent of Australia's elite athletes perceive that Sydney hosting the 2000 Olympic Games will increase the pressure on them to use performance enhancing drugs. These enhanced domestic programs will ensure that this perceived pressure does not result in any drug use. I am aware that many of our top athletes are concerned that, in relation to drugs in sport, they are not competing internationally on a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased funding to the Australian Sports Drugs Agency in this year's budget will also assist the agency in arguing on behalf of our athletes for an international level playing field. This will involve the development of additional anti-doping agreements with other governments, as well as encouraging the implementation of drug testing programs administered independently by international sports federations on a year round basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be encouraging all sectors of the Australian sports community to support our international efforts. This will include the national sporting organisations, the Australian Olympic Committee and SOCOG. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is already working closely with the AOC and SOCOG in the pursuit of a drug-free Sydney 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All athletes from home or abroad are now on notice that ASDA's enhanced program will promote a sporting environment in this country before, during and beyond the Sydney Olympics that is free from performance enhancing drugs. Doping is undermining the credibility of sport throughout the world. If it continues, both government and non-government organisations will be less inclined to provide the necessary financial support to sport. There have already been many examples of sponsors removing their commitment to athletes as a result of positive drug tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector will be expected to make a major contribution to the financial success of Sydney 2000. Corporations will be more inclined to be associated with a games that is drug free than a games that is tainted in any way by drug misuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pursuit of a drug-free Sydney 2000 Olympics can re-establish the credibility of international sport. But this will only be a milestone in anti-doping. More importantly, it can provide a launching pad to take the drug-free sporting ethos into the 21st century. That is something that future generations of sporting men and women deserve to enjoy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Minister, is the Prime Minister right? Is it never going to get any better for small business? On the your calculations, how many of them should give up and go back to PAYE employment? Do you, as the small business minister, support the Prime Minister's comments?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen an extract of the remarks made by the Prime Minister. I do not think Senator Kernot has quoted them in their entirety. The Prime Minister said that growth is currently running at around five per cent and that we have inflation at 3 1/2 per cent. Those two figures together represent about the best we have ever had. Remember that growth is at five per cent and inflation is at 3 1/2 per cent. They are the two points that the Prime Minister was putting together. In that environment, small business and big business&mdash;all business&mdash;should be able to do well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Kernot&mdash;I am sure that she knows this&mdash;that there are over 880,000 businesses in Australia, of which well over 800,000 are small businesses. Over half of them are what we would call micro-businesses, which feature the self-employed and have a non-corporate structure. Many of them involve people who all the time move from employment into running a small business and back. Unfortunately, we do not have exact figures or a statistical base to know how many are moving backwards and forwards in what is, and always will be, a very dynamic part of the economy. So it is not unreasonable to suggest that there will always be people who choose to say, `Small business has not worked out for me. I will return to being a PAYE employee.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at most of the advice given by sensible accountants and financial institutions to people who seek to go into small business. Many advise quite rightly that their small business proposal will not be viable and that they should not implement it. From time to time, professional accountants and advisers also sensibly advise such people that their small business is not viable and that they should leave it. That appropriate advice is being given all the time. Over the last 12 months or more, our economy has been growing, on average, at around five per cent and has had very low inflation. The Prime Minister commented that people who are still having difficulty may have to look at leaving small business. There is nothing startling about that, because people are leaving and joining small business year in and year out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we did not have those dynamic changes going on, in my view we would have a very constipated small business section of the economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that last point, of course it will. When we came to power in 1983, the textiles, clothing and footwear sector in Australia was on its knees. We set about reducing tariff protection and restructuring that sector. It now employs just over 100,000 Australians in 3,500 establishments. It now contributes to six per cent of the total private consumption expenditure in Australia each year, and it now exports $690 million worth of products from Australia. They are the latest figures&mdash;the 1993-94 figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a turnaround in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. It has got smarter, it has done better in the export market and it has become more internationally competitive. It is for those reasons that the government, in looking at the TCF plan, commissioned a report last year to look at further strategies to enhance the competitiveness of this sector. The TCF 2000 development package is one that we have responded to in this year's budget. The purpose of the package is to bring together government, industries, unions and firms and concentrate them on improving the management and leadership skills of this sector, building a better customer focus, entrenching quality performance and establishing information networks to help the industry expand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget we announced our response to the proposals under that package. They are briefly put in five quite clear and distinct parts: an outreach program, which will assist at least 100 firms to take up best practice manufacturing practices; a quality program, which will assist firms or clusters of firms to reach international quality accreditation, the ISO standards; an international information program that establishes joint intelligence networks for sectors to identify new international customers and develop suitable marketing strategies; an infrastructure program incorporating investment promotion and attraction, funding for training infrastructure and an outworker information program; and the retention of the import credit scheme and overseas assembly provisions until the year 2000. I might say, in parenthesis, the exports of wet blue hides will no longer be eligible for the import credit scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the features of the program. It has received a positive response from the industry. It enables the government to work with an industry that has undertaken massive restructuring and that is now world competitive and to see that it succeeds to be APEC ready and global economy competitive by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, with the opening up of freer trade in the APEC region because of the move due to the Bogor declaration of leaders last year to free trade in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2020, under this plan, working with the industry I am sure the Australian government&mdash;and that is the industry's view&mdash;has helped it take advantage of that more open market. This has caused Australian clothing companies in particular to focus on the upper quality end of the market so that they are not competing head to head with low cost, low wage countries but are carving out a niche for themselves as quality suppliers. That is what the basis of this industry resurgence has been built on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five elements of this plan are to encourage them to build further on that. That is good news for the industry; good news for workers in the industry; good news for Australia in the sense that it is a vibrant and important part of our national industry base and is set to continue to expand; and good news for the current account as we pick up more export markets.</PARA>

What you were told by Senator Collins, which is consistent with Ms O'Donoghue's press release, and which I would be perfectly happy to confirm as a result of further investigation, is that of that $42 million, $18 million, which is $9 million plus $9 million over two years, was to be spent on land management, which is something we all wanted; $10 million plus $10 million, namely $20 million, was to be spent on acquisitions in the Northern Territory; and $2 million plus $2 million, namely $4 million, was to be spent on acquisitions elsewhere.

I do not know what the reference to November 1994 is about. I will have to have a look at that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Can the minister explain the rationale to tax every Australian's dream home and the future renovations on all residential properties, particularly when only last month Mr Howe said `access to affordable housing is essential to the wellbeing of ordinary Australians and hence inseparable from the larger question of social justice' and that the government will `deliver high levels of housing affordability for all Australians'? What research and consultation did the government undertake on the impact of this tax on the cost of building, renovating or buying a home as well as the effect on home rents?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement attributed to the Deputy Prime Minister is one that the government is very solidly committed to. We are committed to it in a way that provides meaningful results for Australian home owners and home buyers. One way in which we are committed to it is not to fabricate the facts. The fact is that Senator Tambling has been trying to run a fabricated, hysterical campaign in the community, misleading and alarming people as to the impact of this measure in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He put out a press statement that said that the government was talking about a $2,500 home tax when the true facts are that the impact of the tax on homes will be absolutely nowhere near that cost. His $2,500 figure is one that has been given the lie to even by the Housing Industry Association which, in its press statement, acknowledged that the figure may be $1,000. So already, Senator Tambling, you are 2 1/2 times off. The truth is that, on the department's advice and reckoning, in respect of a $100,000 home, we are talking about some $400; not $2,500, not $1,000, but $400.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main driving forces for this measure was to ensure consistency in the current system. At the moment we have a system which has disparities in the treatment of certain goods; for example, fittings such as sinks, toilets, bath and towel rails are currently taxed at 11 per cent but associated taps, nozzles and shower heads are exempt. In order to bring consistency, the government, as one motivating force, has introduced this measure. It should be acknowledged that we have done so in an environment in which the price of houses has decreased marginally, and in which this budget has put the lid on interest rates. They have been steadying for some time now; that is acknowledged by the housing industry. We have done so in an environment in which the inflation forecast is low, which is obviously of great importance to people buying homes, and in an environment in which the industry acknowledges that housing affordability is at good levels.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me quote from a statement of 7 May by Dr Ron Silberberg, the national executive director of the HIA. This partly reflects the government's commitment to the housing industry and to home owners and buyers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Housing affordability conditions made a welcome recovery in the first three months of 1995. With home mortgage rates steadying, home buying affordability remains well above the conditions applying when interest rates peaked in the last recession. The latest Commonwealth Bank-HIA housing report shows that the housing affordability index for Australia rose from 135.5 in the December quarter 1994 to 138 in the March quarter 1995. When interest rates last peaked in the September quarter 1989, the rate had slumped to 96.5.</PARA>
<PARA>We are committed to Australians owning their own homes. We are tackling that in a way that is consistent with the outcome of enhancing home ownership. We have one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. We are keen to maintain that. On top of that, in terms of housing, this budget allocated $2 1/2 billion in housing and rental assistance for those who do not own their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the level of commitment we have. When we compare it to other commitments in this parliament, we see that there is only one side of the parliament that is prepared and equipped to tackle the economy and the situation in the broader community&mdash;that is, this side of the parliament, not the other side. We do not tackle issues like this with fabrication, hysteria and false arguments, trying to scare people. We would rather do it systematically. We are doing it in a way which enhances the level of home ownership in this country and keeps it at one of the highest levels in the world.</PARA>

I ask the question: how much more or less is that than in previous budgets? That is terribly important. Secondly, the minister quoted from Mr Silberberg's press release. I ask the minister if he saw today's press release which says that the revenue take will be about $550 million in 1995-96 compared with the budget estimate of $215 million. In other words, the budget has underestimated by more than half the revenue grab. That is detailed as follows: the impact will be&mdash;repairs and maintenance $144 million, renovations and additions $160 million, new buildings $146 million and office buildings $100 million, a total of $550 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I was asked by Senator Baume earlier in the week about the presence of certain British parliamentarians at the Gallipoli ceremony and another question about hymn singing. May I respond as follows. The dawn service at Anzac Cove organised by the Australian Embassy in consultation with the New Zealand Embassy in Ankara was open to the public. The British Embassy in Ankara some days before the event sent a report to London which included the advice that the Australians and New Zealanders would be very pleased for anyone to come to the dawn service, mentioning, however, that there was unlikely to be space in the VIP enclosure as that had been organised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spectator</EMPHASIS> article of 6 May that Senator Baume referred to that Lord Bethell quotes the UK Foreign Office in London as saying that the service was the `Aussies show'. No mention is made in this article of any advice given by Australian Foreign Affairs officials. If indeed any British parliamentarians were under the impression from any contacts they may have had with Australian Foreign Affairs officials that they had been asked not to attend the service, I can only say that there must have been some misunderstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cemetery area was expected to be crowded, but anyone wanting to attend would have been welcome to join those present, as Lord Bethell and one other British MP did. It is certainly not, I reconfirm, Australian government policy to exclude our friends from commemorative services such as those at Gallipoli. In the event that in the future with appropriate notice being given it was anticipated that some VIP presence would be there, I am sure we would find it possible to accommodate them in an appropriate way, perhaps in a more appropriate way than on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second question, I can tell the Senate that I am advised that it has not been customary in recent years to have hymns at the Anzac Cove and Lone Pine ceremonies. It was decided for 1995 that in addition to various addresses and wreath laying the playing of national anthems would be a sufficient and dignified musical conclusion to these ceremonies. Accordingly, recordings of the Australian and New Zealand national anthems were played at Anzac Cove and the Australian national anthem at Lone Pine. A New Zealand Queen's bagpiper and an Australian piper played at Anzac Cove. The Australian piper also played at Lone Pine.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Eightieth Commemoration of ANZAC Day at Gallipoli involved a series of events spread out over the Gallipoli Peninsula. They were attended by President Demirel of Turkey, official representatives of the Governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Pakistan, the United Kingdom and Turkey and thousands of people who had made their own way to the events.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The battle area of the Gallipoli Peninsula is isolated (about six hours from Istanbul by road) and lacks the facilities to cope with large numbers of official visitors and crowds such as attended the ceremonies. The roads between the various memorials are for the most part single lane and include dirt tracks. The nearest city, Cannakale, is a 5 kilometre ferry ride from the Peninsula via Eceabat. Communications between the memorials are limited as they are spread out and, I am advised, mobile telephones do not function effectively in the area. Moreover, ordinary walkie-talkie systems do not operate successfully in the Lone Pine area. To have had available a satisfactory mobile communications system, it appears we would have had to bring in an Australian military communications unit. We have only done this once, on the 75th anniversary ceremony in 1990, when the Australian presence and resources committed were very much greater than on this occasion. While the Embassy has suggested that perhaps it should have considered this further, in my view it would have been extremely unlikely that we would have agreed to such a large scale and expensive undertaking on this occasion which while larger than normal was much smaller than in 1990. Furthermore, our Embassy in Turkey, including Ambassador Evans and Senior Administrative Officer Perry, have over the last few years successfully conducted ANZAC Day ceremonies on the Peninsula without access to such communications systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security on the Peninsula was extremely heavy due to the presence of President Demirel and other dignitaries and in the wake of a terrorist bombing in Istanbul on the weekend prior to ANZAC Day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 April, the Australian Embassy cabled relevant authorities in Canberra, including to Minister Sciacca's Department, on the conditions at Gallipoli which included a warning of likely traffic and crowd congestion and tight security. (See Attachment 1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Embassy also issued notes for visitors drawing attention to the difficult security and transport conditions on the Peninsula. It was also noted, specifically, that the international ceremony was some 30 minutes drive from Lone Pine; that it may be difficult to get to Lone Pine in time for the start of the ceremony at that location; and that because of the day's tight schedule, it would not be possible to delay the commencement time of the ceremony.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turkish Government controlled the movement of official guests to Gallipoli and between the various memorials. Its security forces were handicapped by the poor communications on the Peninsula.</PARA>

It also had to manage an official visit by Senator McMullan and his party to Istanbul and Ankara on 26-28 April, including a Joint Economic Committee meeting in Ankara on 27 April involving some 16 Australian business persons. Its resources were supplemented by the services of a Departmental officer from Damascus from mid-March (excepting the week of Easter) and a relief communicator from London for the weeks before and during ANZAC Day plus two additional locally engaged staff. The Post's communications system was upgraded and additional funds of, initially, $40,000 were provided on the understanding that additional funds would be made available to meet extra legitimate costs. However two key locally engaged officers went on sick leave for the last one and a half months and three weeks respectively of preparations which placed unforeseen pressures on the Post.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dawn Service at ANZAC Cove itself was organised by the Australian Embassy but the transport of official Australian and New Zealand guests to the ceremony was dependent on the Turkish authorities. It was scheduled to begin at 5.30 a.m. but the crowd began gathering from 3.00 a.m. Minister Sciacca, who gave the welcoming address, and his party were in place by 5.00 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The start of the ceremony was delayed until around 6.20 a.m., some 20 to 30 minutes after first light, by the delayed arrival of the official Australian and New Zealand parties including the Governor-General and New Zealand's Deputy Prime Minister. The Turkish authorities have stated that sunrise was not until 6.22 a.m. but first light was, in fact, well before 6.00 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Assessment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am satisfied that the cause of the delay to the Dawn Service was due entirely to events outside the control of the Australian authorities. The vessel "Akdeniz" which transported the official parties to the Peninsula was late departing and arriving, even though all foreign official guests were on board as scheduled. Apparently its departure was due to the late arrival of Turkish medical equipment. The vessel made up some lost time but the docking and ferrying of the official parties by the Turkish authorities was also delayed apparently due to logistical problems. The Australian Embassy had earlier explored with the Turkish authorities the possibility of other means of transport for the official parties to the Peninsula (e.g. by helicopter) but the Turkish authorities decided on transport and accommodation on the Akdeniz, as was their prerogative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media have raised the question as to whether the Dawn Service at ANZAC Cove should have started on time in the absence of the Governor-General and the other official guests who were delayed including New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. Those who were late included most of the main official participants and speakers. In my view the answer to this question is clearly "no". It may be a matter for consideration as to whether in future there should be a broadly acknowledged rule that dawn services are to start on time even in the absence of official dignitaries. No such rule has existed to this time, however, and in its absence a decision to start without the official party, including the Governor-General as Australia's Head of State, would have been quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Late Arrival of Minister Sciacca and Party at the Ceremony at Lone Pine</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lone Pine ceremony was originally scheduled to start at 11.50 a.m. but was re-scheduled two weeks earlier to commence at 12.15 p.m. It commenced on time with the Australian military guard, whose arrival had been delayed, moving quickly into position and the MC then calling the Australian Ambassador to address the audience. (The purpose of the Ambassador's unscheduled comments was to apologise for the delay in the Dawn Service at ANZAC Cove). The MC has stated that he commenced the Service after the military guard had marched into position; "At no stage did anyone state that the Service was not to commence without him [Mr Sciacca]. It was apparent that the Officials' Party were in place and that we were well past the start time. No attempt was made to further delay the commencement when I moved to the rostrum". (See Attachment 7).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MC then asked Minister Sciacca to deliver his address. When it became evident that the Minister was not present, Senator McMullan took the microphone, apologised for the absence of the Minister and delivered the Minister's speech. The Governor-General  then spoke. Minister Sciacca and his party arrived some 7 minutes after the commencement of the ceremony, towards the end of the Governor-General's speech, and were able to join the official party for the rest of the ceremony, including laying of wreaths and being present for the Last Post.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the ceremony Minister Sciacca sought to establish who had commenced the ceremony prior to his arrival. The Ambassador apologised for this development and told the Minister that he took responsibility for this. Minister Sciacca expressed the view that "heads had to roll" and formed the view that the main person to blame was the Senior Administration Officer from the Australian Embassy. He advised the Australian media that he was "extremely disappointed and extremely angry, and whoever did this, I want their head." (See Attachment 13).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Assessment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the late arrival of Minister Sciacca and his party at Lone Pine was due to his bus being blocked by other vehicles at the International Ceremony at the Monument of Martyrs. I have established that the Minister's party had been briefed by the Embassy on what needed to be done to get its bus into position to make a speedy exit from that Monument. There was no delay in boarding the bus. The Minister's bus had been issued with a pass as required by the Turkish authorities, but this pass was not respected by all security personnel involved. As noted above, such potential problems were foreseen by the Australian Embassy and it had earlier suggested to Minister Sciacca that he should travel by car rather than by bus. The Minister, understandably, chose to travel with his delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that no official in authority was aware before the ceremony commenced that Minister Sciacca and his party were not present. (One more junior official at the Embassy became aware of his absence but not in time to be able to alert those in authority of this fact before the ceremony commenced.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises as to why officials in authority did not notice the absence of Mr Sciacca and his party. Mr Perry and some others were caught up attending to last minute administrative problems that had arisen because of some unexpected actions on the Turkish side, and some other essential problems which had arisen. The Ambassador was engaged with the Governor-General and was focussing on his own presentation. The Governor-General and Senator McMullan had been present for some 10 minutes. Both had important commitments involving President Demirel following the Lone Pine ceremony and there was already pressure on their availability to meet these commitments, since the start time had been moved from 11.50 a.m. to 12.15 p.m. precisely in order to allow more time for people to arrive from the international ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also make the point that even had Minister Sciacca's absence been noted prior to 12.15 p.m., officials would have had no way of knowing how long he would have been delayed. (I have dealt in paragraph 3 above with the reasons for not having a local communications network available). The difficulties in travelling by road to Lone Pine due particularly to extremely heavy security and the consequent uncertainty of possible arrival times has been reinforced by the Australian military commander, Lt Col O'Brien. Had, moreover, officials delayed the commencement of the ceremony, they would probably have been criticised by the Australian media for again delaying a ceremony due to the late arrival of official guests, as they did with respect to the Dawn Service. In these circumstances, officials would have been in a "no-win" situation even in the hypothetical situation of having known of the absence of Mr Sciacca and his party. I have to say that had in fact Mr Sciacca's absence been known, and had, in fact, it been known how far away he was, it would have been a matter for fine judgement to have delayed the ceremony given the delays of the morning and given the Governor-General and Senator McMullan's subsequent commitments to President Demirel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ambassador has publicly and privately accepted responsibility for the incident. I would therefore suggest that the Ambassador's apology to Minister Sciacca following the ceremony, and his subsequent written apology to the Minister (Attachment 17) and to each of the pilgrims on the Minister's delegation is a sufficient response to the situation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that the Australian Embassy carried out an extremely demanding and complex task in a professional manner, involving much voluntary after hours work and great dedication. All ceremonies on the day were conducted with due dignity and sense of historic occasion. The New Zealand Ambassador has written to thank the Embassy for organising the "truly memorable and very moving" Dawn Service in "extremely difficult" circumstances (Attachment 14). The Governor-General considers the commemorations were very successful and has written in strong support of the Ambassador and his staff. The Australian military commander has written that Mr Perry on behalf of the Embassy prepared and handled the ANZAC day ceremonies extremely well and that the difficulties were principally a result of changes made by Turkish authorities at short notice or as a result of the extremely tight security. His report also noted that Mr Perry prepared the ceremonies with good attention to detail (Attachment 7). While it is a fact that the problems that arose on this occasion were a matter within the mandate of Turkish authorities, I do not think for a moment that any criticism should be levelled at them. The ANZAC Day ceremonies now involve a multitude of countries and ceremonies at a variety of locations and at a variety of times. Turkey's own national ceremonies also take place. Turkey devotes enormous resources to this effort in very trying circumstances and has over many years shown great generosity of spirit and magnificent practical assistance in our commemoration of this important day in our year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff were personally as well as professionally deeply disappointed that, despite their efforts, events did not go entirely as planned, even though they had anticipated the potential for problems and had advised visitors accordingly. For our Embassy in Turkey the ANZAC Day tradition looms extremely large, particularly when officers like Ambassador Evans and Mr Perry have devoted great effort over several years to carrying out successfully the Anzac Day major ceremonies outside Australia. There can be few people more devoted than our officers in our Embassy in Turkey in making sure the Anzac Day ceremonies are a success. The three glitches in the ceremonies were all due to events that were beyond the control of Australian authorities. The fact that Minister Sciacca and his delegation missed the start of the Lone Pine ceremony was deeply regrettable but, on measured reflection, it is also understandable how this happened. It would in my view be unjustified to seek to attribute blame to either the Embassy or any other Australian authority for this incident. The Ambassador has, nevertheless, accepted responsibility and has formally apologised to the Minister and to the pilgrims and I believe no further action is warranted and that the Embassy is to be commended for its sterling efforts over the last few months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be giving further careful consideration as to how arrangements for future ceremonies at Gallipoli might be improved so as to minimise the risk of the types of problems addressed above. Following are, however, some initial thoughts:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department provided most of the additional resources requested by the Post. It is clear that Embassy officers were still under severe strain, exacerbated by unexpected absences. However, the incidents that occurred on the day would not seem to have been directly related to the resourcing of the Mission.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to look again at whether there are viable, cost effective mobile communications systems that would function effectively at Gallipoli.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to discuss again with the Turkish authorities whether there can be a further improvement  on such issues as the timing of the events, the effective use of security passes for official guests, their transport arrangements and the use of police escorts (but bearing in mind that we are guests in their country and that they expend considerable resources in organising the commemorations).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank Senator Gareth Evans for providing the parliament with this report, which I understand was in one way or another presented to the caucus earlier this week. Having been at the ceremony along with Senator Chapman and Senator Teague, who is not here, I had an opportunity to see what actually happened. I regret to tell the minister&mdash;and I am not going to develop this at great length here&mdash;that the version he has just given us is not accurate. Someone in his department has unfortunately set out to mislead the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not support all the points made by two of the members of his own party in the House of Representatives this morning, I do want to say that the bulk of what Mr David Simmons had to say was in my view an accurate reflection of what happened. I saw him in an agitated state. I could not hear exactly what he was saying, but I saw him in discussion with a junior member of the staff of the Ankara embassy. Immediately after that, he expressed to me his outrage that she had refused to convey his demand that the proceedings should not proceed because Mr Sciacca was not there. Unfortunately, Mr Simmons was in mid-argument with this junior official when the proceedings started. So it was then out of his hands and he could not himself go over and instruct the captain, who was totally blameless in this matter and who was the Master of Ceremonies, not to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot tell the minister how dreadfully embarrassing and upsetting it was at that ceremony&mdash;Senator McMullan was there and is aware of this&mdash;for the captain to call on the minister, Mr Sciacca, to welcome people to this ceremony for the 80th anniversary of Gallipoli, for the minister not to be there and for a subdued laugh, I suppose you could call it, to go around this solemn ceremony: a laugh at the incompetence of Australian officialdom. It was terribly depressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us who were there felt not only embarrassment but anger that the centrepiece of that ceremony, which was to have been the pilgrims presenting their wreaths and mementoes&mdash;a matter of enormous significance&mdash;did not proceed as it should have and that there was this rush at the end. I commend Senator McMullan for stepping forward and filling the breach when Mr Sciacca's name was called and he did not respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister that when you are in charge of a function it is a basic rule of conducting any function at all that you establish before you begin, particularly such a solemn ceremony as this, that the participants are there. Maybe it was just a mistake but it was a mistake of horrendous proportions from anyone who was in charge of such a thing. It put Australia's good name at risk&mdash;in fact, it made us a muttered laughing stock&mdash;and it damaged a very solemn occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is most unfortunate that the Governor-General has been subjected to criticism on his role in this matter. I think that is grossly unfair. When you are a head of state at an event, as he was, it would have been improper for him to have intervened. I am certain that he was not aware that Mr Sciacca was not there. We were all separate; we were put to one side. The minister was to one side. It was a situation where, quite frankly, the organisation was inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, I would like to stress that the Ambassador to Turkey, David Evans, always behaved in his dealings with me&mdash;and, I am certain, with my colleagues&mdash;with the utmost courtesy. He was very helpful to us. I would not want to suggest that damage or blame should be attributed to him in any of these matters. I suppose we can say that because a junior member of his staff may not have acted properly that he has to bear the ultimate responsibility. That seems a bit tough. The Governor-General was totally blameless and was caught in the involvement of the particular problems that the Turks had and was not in a position to defend himself. It is unfortunate that he should be criticised. I would certainly seek, in a bipartisan way, to defend him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the minister for his comment that for some years now at Gallipoli hymns have not been sung. I find that to be just dreadful. The dawn services that I attend every year in Australia have always relied on the participation of a religious, as well as a secular, form of service. A dawn service without, for example, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Abide with me</EMPHASIS>, does not represent the sort of dawn service most of us have known all our lives. I do not know who made this decision but I regret it. I regret the nature of the decision because I do not think anyone on this side of the chamber was aware that it had been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it right that one should make too much of this situation. I understand that members of the media were not properly accommodated, which got them off side. The whole thing was a real problem. There are some people who read deeper things into this, saying that it is part of some republican agenda and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that concerns me is that there was a mistake. It would be better for DFAT to acknowledge the mistake rather than to pretend that there was no mistake and that it was just a series of unfortunate coincidences. I must admit that I am simply depending&mdash;because I have not had the opportunity of reading this; I will read it later&mdash;on what I understand was said about this matter in the Labor caucus room. I think it a bit unfair for the minister to say that Mr Simmons was intemperate and that this situation arose simply because no-one had noticed that Mr Sciacca was not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Sciacca is someone very difficult not to notice, even in a crowd of that size, and so would be a contingent of pilgrims specifically dressed in very distinctive blazers and uniforms who were to play such an important role in this ceremony. On top of that, I can confirm&mdash;as I am certain Senator Chapman can&mdash;that an official of that embassy was apprised of the fact that Mr Sciacca and the pilgrims were not there and that the ceremony should not proceed. She took the view that she could not, and should not, limit or delay the proceedings. I do not put all the blame on her, but any official running any function whatsoever should ensure that the participants are there before allowing it to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the minister and stress to him that I am taking a totally bipartisan view. I do not want to take any political shots at anyone on this, because I think it is far too important a point. Members of the minister's own party have been far more critical of this matter than I have. I conclude by commending Senator McMullan for his role then and later, when he corrected an oversight. I understand that he participated in a much more moving ceremony at Lone Pine than the one that Senator Chapman, Senator Teague and I had attended. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply give an example from my situation there. I think the Hon. David Simmons has referred to this in the House of Representatives. There was clearly a bungle on the part of representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I had ordered two wreaths for presentation at the Lone Pine ceremony, one for me to lay and another for my young son to lay.

After some time of rustling around, a second wreath miraculously appeared; so that problem was solved. However, a wreath could not subsequently be found for Mr Ted Lindsay to lay at the Lone Pine ceremony, despite his having ordered one. This simply reinforces the unsatisfactory way in which this matter was managed and administered by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We explained to the Senate that the reason ATSIC would keep receiving this $21 million a year until 1997 was to get around the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Northern Territory, and his assurances to every Aboriginal in Australia, that this would not be a back door method of increasing the amount of pastoral land bought in the Northern Territory. On two or three occasions in the Senate&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is there for everybody to read&mdash;Senator Collins said that was not the reason things were being done in this way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record speaks for itself. I certainly do not place an interpretation on what was said there, although Senator Campbell obviously does. I have read it and Senator Gareth Evans has succinctly put his views about it. I also spoke to the chair of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, today to express my personal concern about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell would accept, I am not the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs so I am not in a position to unilaterally say what the government's position will be on this matter. The statements I made to the Senate during the ATSIC debate were based on my knowledge that three and sometimes four&mdash;depending on Yami Lester's election&mdash;of the 19 ATSIC commissioners were from the Northern Territory. At the time I thought that achieving that against all the odds was testimony to the persuasive powers of Northern Territorians. It was on that basis that I made the statement that there would be some concern expressed by other ATSIC commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the decision was a controversial one&mdash;the fact that Senator Campbell has the advantage of leaked papers indicates the level of disaffection with the decision&mdash;that the ATSIC board was split and that it took a casting vote by the chair to determine the issue. That was of concern to me and, as a courtesy, I expressed that concern to Lois O'Donoghue before the matter was raised in the Senate. I will continue to pursue that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in question time today, now that this matter is in the public domain&mdash;I was not aware of it until 48 hours ago&mdash;views are now being expressed by Aboriginal organisations in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obliged to Senator Chamarette for allowing me to have priority to speak on this matter. I might say at the outset that the coalition shares the concern of Senator Bob Collins in relation to this latest event because during the debate on the land fund bill it was made abundantly clear that the money in excess of the $20 million allocated each year to ATSIC would not all go to expenditure on acquisition of land in the Northern Territory. That comprises roughly half of the total annual sum allowed for acquisition of land for Aboriginal people. It would be unfair if half of the total expenditure was spent in only one area of Australia; namely, a territory which does not have a majority of the Aboriginal population in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the potential for creating great division in the Aboriginal community because ATSIC has embarked upon a decision which will allow up to 50 per cent of expenditure for land acquisition to be spent on just one area&mdash;Aboriginal people within the Northern Territory. Of course, Aboriginal people in Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania would feel left out. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the ACT. That is why the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council is taking action and complaining bitterly about this, because this decision will leave it out in the cold. When we debated how the money would be dealt with, the coalition expressed great reservation about this funding being reserved to ATSIC. We were told, `Look, don't worry. It won't all be spent in the Northern Territory. We will continue to acquire land on the basis that we have been purchasing it to date.' That is roughly, I think, a station or two a year, but it is certainly nothing in the order of $20 million. If you average it out at $2 million a station, it would be 10 stations a year. That is just unfair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this decision needs looking into. It really does cast some doubt on the accountability of this Indigenous Land Corporation, which is set up under the land fund and has this autonomy in purchasing land. There should be some review of how it will operate. We heard Senator Collins saying that the government really does not have any control over ATSIC's purchasing ability or decisions. I can understand how people say, `Well, ATSIC should be autonomous,' but the problem is that, when it makes a decision of this sort, it has the potential to create great division within the Aboriginal community. That is harmful not only to the Aboriginal people of Australia but also to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the taxpayers of Australia have a right to see their money being spent in an even-handed manner; that is, you look across the country as a whole and you apportion the money in an even-handed way. This is not doing that. It is for that reason that this decision has to be criticised, and I am pleased to hear that Senator Collins is concerned about it. I do remember the debate in this chamber only too well when the government assured us that ATSIC would not be doing this very thing&mdash;that is, spending the vast majority of its land acquisition money in one area; namely, the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the people in the Northern Territory were of that view. The government must do more than just be concerned about this matter. It must take action to use its influence in relation to ATSIC to make sure that this does not go ahead. It casts doubt on how the Indigenous Land Corporation will operate. If it is going to make decisions in the future along the lines that we have just seen here, we will not get satisfaction for money. We will not get satisfaction for the Aboriginal people across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to Senator Bob Collins's response as well as the related response to me from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). My question was not satisfactorily answered and I will certainly be awaiting a more adequate response when the Senate resumes if I have not received it beforehand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked an important question: how much of the $18 million that has been set aside by ATSIC for land management over the next two years has been allocated to the Northern Territory? It is crucial information as to whether the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has misled this Senate and the public. In any case, I believe that the Senate and the public have been misled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My distinct memory of Senator Collins's response&mdash;and I will have to check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record&mdash;is that he made a joke of the question that was put forward quite legitimately by Senator Campbell. Senator Collins said that it was nonsense, that it was not $20 million that had been put out of the $24 million but $20 million out of $42 million. He was deliberately overlooking the fact, when he stated that it was $42 million that had been set aside for land acquisition, that only $24 million has been set aside for land acquisition, of which the Northern Territory has certainly been granted $20 million by the ATSIC decision, and that $18 million has been set aside for land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No information is available to me as to how much of that will be taken up by the Northern Territory. If there is not a substantial proportion of it that is taken up, there should be. If that money is being given for land acquisition in the Northern Territory, there will certainly be land management needs. If that land management funding has not been given through this ATSIC funding, then there is another way in which it will impinge on the other half of the funding for the next two years which is actually part of the Indigenous Land Corporation land fund money of $21 million. That will mean that the amount that has been given to the Northern Territory for acquisition of land will then be required to be added to for management of those lands from funds available under the ILC component of the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were the matters I raised in the debate on the land fund at the time. This underlies the orchestrated debate against the use of any kind of prioritising of needs in the allocation of the land fund money. I will quote something that I asked while the debate was going on because I think the deal and the double deal need to be on the public record. It should also be on the record that both Senator Collins, who answered my question in a very facetious way and basically denied the validity of my argument, and Senator Evans, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, have a responsibility here. The second tranche of the response to the High Court decision on Mabo is the responsibility of the government. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would like to ask the minister to justify why this split is necessary, because I think it needs to be on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA>I was referring here to the split between the $21 million to ATSIC for the next two years to 1997, and the $21 million plus $3 million available to the ILC, because I think it needs to be on the public record. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I have heard is that it was initially a deal with the Northern Territory government essentially against the interests of the Aboriginal people by preventing them from using any of the ILC funds under the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory. There was then a double deal&mdash;or a counter deal&mdash;with the Aboriginal people that said, `It's all right; half will still be going to ATSIC'</PARA>
<PARA>until 1997&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and then presumably to the Northern Territory people who would be disadvantaged by the first deal in order to gain access under the Land Rights Northern Territory Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have very strong evidence that the government was using its role within ATSIC to manipulate decisions within ATSIC which it needed for its own legislation and to support or substantiate the deals made between the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. I believe that the government has a question to answer. It needs to say whether it is supporting ATSIC's decisions&mdash;and why. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr this day, relating to the 1995-96 budget and national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a response given to a non-technical question. It was an interesting question because it raised the issue of the nation's savings and what the government is doing about them. Not surprisingly, in the response, Senator Cook referred to the grand superannuation plan which was such a central feature of this year's budget. I wish to raise a number of questions from a number of people who did not get too many advantages out of the grand superannuation plan which was such an important part of this year's budget. Then I wish to raise a number of questions about the actuarial calculations which were behind those plans, on which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made such grand statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, why should people on $60,000 have to subsidise people on higher to middle incomes, on $40,000? That is the first question. Then I refer to self-funded retirees, those people who have saved this country hundreds of millions of dollars. They have saved for their independent retirement and they have got nothing. The government has cancelled the second tranche of the personal income tax cuts promised in the One Nation statement. In that cancellation, these very people have got no benefits from the tax cuts which, allegedly, hopefully, provided we can get enough money, are going to be transferred into superannuation accounts sometime after 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made rather a shrewd move in its plans to transfer these so-called funds&mdash;if it has the money available, if it is believable&mdash;into the superannuation accounts later this decade. The government was shrewd because it chose not to use the legislative mechanism but to use awards and enterprise agreements. In so doing, it has created yet another massive layer of legislative complexity and runs the risk, I say to Senator Schacht, that not everybody will be covered. I think that is a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's attempt to overcome this problem it has created another problem for itself. After all, it was the imperfections in the award system that led to the necessity for the superannuation guarantee charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem because the government is using the tax mechanism to get the information. This is going to be a very imperfect situation. People will pay one year and get the benefit the next year on a one-to-one basis provided their income level is right. For those at the bottom, it will not help much because they will still be under the government safety net. The problem here is that there will be difficulties in working out the details of what I term qualifying contributions, particularly for those people who go from job to job during the year. How will they remember? The government is going to ask the employer, probably not through goodwill&mdash;and it will require a bit of goodwill&mdash;to put this information on their group certificates, listing the eligible contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since my time is running out, the important thing I wish to raise is the issue of this gross final benefit of $461,907. This was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving for our future</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;table 1, employee and government contributions effect on retirement incomes after 40 years. Very few people nowadays get anywhere near the 40 years, so they will not get anywhere near that sort of benefit. But having looked at some of the actuarial calculations, I believe the figure is based on the top side of opti mism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that there is no allowance in these calculations in a lot of funds that actually provide sickness or disability relief. That is quite common in a lot of funds. If we take that out&mdash;the costs incurred for additional cover&mdash;we will not get anywhere near that fin al benefit. Where are the administration costs? It may be true that this is a gross figure, because it does say a gross figure. If we deduct administration from this, we are going to get a significantly lower figure&mdash;maybe $40,000 less. If people have not done that, they have overly optimistic estimations on their future earnings which I do not think any actuary worth his salt really could sustain. This is an important issue and I will continue my remarks later tonight. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Essentially, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) gave a non-answer to my question. The fact that she did not answer is a very significant thing, which I will explain in a moment. When I sent the question to her this morning, it was in relation to the fact that Dr Frank Peters had been refused admission to this high-level scientific conference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate my colleague Senator Abetz on initiating this very important motion, which is all about freedom of speech and freedom from intimidation, particularly at the academic level. We have unfortunately witnessed a series of reprehensible actions in Tasmania by two Greens in particular, Mrs Milne and Dr Brown, of which I do not think we can be particularly proud. It is appalling to see two senior Greens adopting the lowest form of criticism by attacking Professor Nigel Forteath at a personal and professional level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freedom of speech is a right to express a personal view, even if it may be an unpopular one. It would appear that the Greens have taken the attitude that it is the prime or exclusive right of parliamentarians to exercise freedom of speech. When one attacks a person by approaching the senate of a university and effectively querying his credentials and right to practise, I believe that we should speak up in every parliament of this country and express our condemnation. It is just not good enough. It is not good enough for a man who aspires to come into this place to take such an attitude and to try to demean another so far as his peers are concerned and take away his livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the message in the process involved in Mrs Milne's action that was so reprehensible. We have to ask: can we, in the future, expect such people to have their livelihoods put at risk and their reputations damaged by such people who take a view different from that which an academic might take? I think universities have been the bastions of free speech in this country. Here I think for the first time we have seen a very dangerous precedent, a precedent that I would not like to see repeated in this generation. Unfortunately, it has been an attempt to muzzle Professor Forteath through defending his right to take a different point of view from that which has been accepted by the Greens. Because of the restrictions on time, I want to make those few brief comments to associate myself with the importance of the right to free speech and to protect a friend in academia, Professor Nigel Forteath. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly. I do not think we needed to have this debate. The loss of government time is of some consequence to the government and the business of the Senate. However, now that the debate has gone to the substance of the motion, we do support the motion. We believe that the way the motion is now worded and amended this morning states the principle of academic freedom and the right of free speech. Irrespective of the arguments over Lake Pedder or any other aspect of it, that is not the point of the motion. The point of the motion is now about academic freedom, the right of free speech for any person to be involved in a public controversy and to express their views without having threats made to them in any form. In this case, supposedly it is about the academic ethics which could affect a person's employment in the university.</PARA></TALK.START>

I table this for the Senate. Whether you agree or disagree with it, his point is a reasonable point to be made as part of the public debate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On page 97 of the evidence which I gave it has been drawn to my attention that a major error has been set down. While given in good faith during interview it is imperative that I correct the statement set out. This statement is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want a conservative estimate of the sort of numbers that you can obtain of this animal, in one place in NSW there are 453 animals over an 11km stretch. Unfortunately, there are few places left in Australia where this actually happens. So my estimate of 2000+ platypuses is probably very conservative indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I request that this is changed to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one study area in NSW an expert in platypus ecology has stated that he has tagged more than 450 in an 11km stretch of river since 1973. This researcher does not claim that 450 animals are living in this stretch of river at any one time. His study has taken place over 15 years and thus it is difficult to make an estimate of actual population numbers without a major research effort and an in depth tagging programme over many years. I believe they are abundant in Lake Pedder and 2000 animals is not a far fetched estimate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that the Democrats hold very dear the protection of the rights of citizens in a democracy to hold and express views and ideas which are alternative and even contrary to the prevailing established ideas of government. Perhaps we even see the need to challenge the established views of the opposition. That is why we established an alternative party. That is why for a decade and a half the Democrats have strongly supported whistleblowers legislation. That is why we support freedom of information legislation. That is why we initiated full public access to information about chemicals. Some people call that the community right to know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding of what has occurred in Tasmania is that a highly charged political debate, ostensibly in defence of Professor Nigel Forteath, has coincidentally had the outcome of a united attack on the present and former leaders of the Tasmanian Greens. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that he presented was challenged and further information was requested and received by that committee from Mr T.R.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His letter was requested because Professor Forteath had requested a change in his testimony as he wanted to correct it, and he apologised for any inconvenience that he caused by the fact that he had not fully reflected on the information that he had presented to the committee. </PARA>

If that is so, I will not be seeking to table it but I will seek leave to table the correspondence to which it relates to show that there has been a genuine difference of academic opinion over the Lake Pedder project and the number of platypus affected by it. I will also table evidence that Professor Forteath agreed that his view was not totally accurate and asked for it to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now read an article written by Michael Lester for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 11 May which gives an account of how this incident arose. The article states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and Opposition voted together to censure national Greens leader Bob Brown and his state colleague Christine Milne for allegedly threatening University of Tasmania professor Nigel Forteath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Dr Bob Brown and Mrs Milne strenuously deny the allegations and last night Professor Forteath said he could not recall either personally threatening him.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we need to take that into consideration when people are mounting such a spirited defence. In the very worthwhile cause of defending somebody's freedom of speech, they are actually violating other people's freedom of speech and their right to present a view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I cannot defend the leader of the Greens in Tasmania, Christine Milne, from my own experience, I will accord her a measure of natural justice by reading from her statement on this matter. It says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every citizen must have the right to speak out publicly and freely, and every other citizen must have the right to publicly question the accuracy of what they say.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens have always been and will continue to be advocates for accountability, openness and freedom of expression.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Tasmanian Parliament yesterday there was the disgraceful defamation of National Greens Leader Dr Bob Brown by the Labor Party on completely spurious grounds&mdash;which over the last 24 hours have been demonstrated to be complete fabrications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Nigel Forteath who the ALP claimed had been threatened and intimidated has said today that neither Dr Brown or myself had ever threatened him. He said that Dr Brown had been polite at the only meeting they had.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never met or spoken with Dr Forteath.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two issues here: one is the right of academics to speak out, the second is professional accountability for what they have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Nigel Forteath made a statement in his capacity as professor of Aquaculture at the University of Tasmania. He said that thousands of Platypus would starve to death if Lake Pedder was restored and that the number of platypus in Lake Pedder was 4000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Forteath was unable to substantiate any of his claims with hard research at a recent academic symposium held at the University of Tasmania. Academic experts, Dr Rose Senior Lecturer in Zoology and Tom Grant Visiting Fellow at University of NSW, have openly disagreed with him and in the case of Dr Grant has revealed to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment that his research was misrepresented by Professor Forteath.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to deal with is that when we in the community deal with debates that are of a controversial nature, particularly things like the Lake Pedder debate and even forestry debates, the various parties use sources of expertise, claimed experts on this and that, to support their various arguments. I think one thing the conservation movement has done time and again is use people who are so-called experts, whether they be professors or otherwise, to support some of the claims that they have made. There have been many occasions when those claims have been proven to be wrong. So it is not really an issue of whether or not Nigel Forteath is right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to platypus at Lake Pedder, I can vouch for the fact&mdash;being someone who has been to Lake Pedder every year for the last 21 years, having spent some six months in overall time on the lake, having walked about two-thirds of the lake's shores and having been on every area of water within the lake&mdash;that there is a substantial platypus population on the lake.

I want to think carefully about what the situation might be. We know there must be ethics committees in universities. We know how much parliaments and the media rely on the information that is provided to them by universities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why this is the case. Most importantly, the reason this mechanism is in place is to protect the reputations of the universities and of those people who are in the position of occasionally being spokespeople in their field of excellence.

The procedure was not to silence what anybody in academia says. There is no evidence whatsoever that there was any move by Christine Milne to seek to have Professor Forteath disciplined. The procedure was to ask an academic who has made a public statement which has obviously had a big public impact to back up the statement with scientific evidence, a rational debate, a paper or some background which other academics&mdash;as they normally do with cross-referencing&mdash;can use to establish the basis of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many, many occasions in this chamber I have heard senators questioned about the basis for statements. That is the right and proper thing to do.

If you are not in a position to back up that statement with scientific data or the basis of your research you may be called to account for your statement. This is extremely important for our system.

I have only dealt with it on the basis of academic freedom and the right of freedom of speech. I am more than happy to table the document.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">REPORT ON DISASTER MANAGEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11 MAY 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1994 the then Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure issued the report of the inquiry into disaster management which it was tasked to carry out by the Senate.  The report covered many aspects of this enormous subject and the government compliments the committee on its </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">endeavours to cover as much of the subject as was possible in the time available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As senators will be aware, the New South Wales bush fires of December 1993 and January 1994 fell within the period of the inquiry and the committee was able to make a limited examination of the response to those fires during its hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government response to the 45 recommendations of the committee report required coordination of a total of 22 commonwealth departments and agencies. Discussions with state and territory governments were also required as a number of the recommendations had implications for those governments.  The response was coordinated by emergency management Australia on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the Hon Arch Bevis MP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has already moved to implement a number of those recommendations of the report which are the responsibility of the commonwealth government.  Those recommendations which relate to matters specifically the responsibility of state governments have been drawn to the attention of those governments through the National Emergency Management Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the government's response has been in preparation there have been continuing improvements in emergency management capability at both commonwealth and state level.  A number of these result from actions undertaken as a result of the committee's recommendations; others are part of the continuous development and improvement policies espoused by all involved in this field. Of particular note is the government's endorsement of a commonwealth policy statement on emergency management which was communicated to responsible state and territory ministers by the Minister for Defence at a meeting of emergency management ministers in Sydney in December 1994.  In this statement the government, for the first time has clearly stated the commonwealth acceptance of certain responsibilities in emergency management in support of the states and territories.  The statement will form the basis for future development of the commonwealth and national capabilities in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend to senators the government's response to the senate standing committee report on disaster management.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">REPORT ON DISASTER MANAGEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">April 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disaster management is a large and complex subject which is difficult to examine in detail over a short period.  The Government is grateful to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for the report of its inquiry into the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Terms of Reference for the Committee were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of the public sector authorities to plan for, forecast and respond to major disasters and large-scale emergencies, fully respecting and utilising the skills and capabilities of volunteer organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has taken a comprehensive approach in its report and looked broadly at the concepts applicable to emergency management, covering the full cycle of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.  It has also produced useful comments and recommendations on matters related to Commonwealth responsibilities and arrangements.  The report provides a valuable synopsis of disaster management arrangements at Commonwealth, State and Territory levels and has identified areas where improvements are warranted.  In the light of emergencies and disasters that occurred during the period of the inquiry, the Committee has also raised some valuable points in relation to such specific issues as the participation of volunteers, and matters arising from the NSW bushfires of January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the recommendations of the report are endorsed by the Government although many will require the cooperation of the States and Territories.  Where appropriate, follow-up action will be pursued with the States and Territories on a bilateral and collective basis through existing arrangements coordinated by Emergency Management Australia (EMA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's response to the report is in two parts:  an overview followed by detailed responses to the specific recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OVERVIEW</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This overview provides comments on the main themes emerging from each of the chapters of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 1&mdash;Disaster Management in Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter defines, in general terms, the disaster management roles of various Commonwealth Government departments and agencies.  In so doing, it highlights the extensive support that the Commonwealth provides for disaster management in Australia and its commitment to working with State, Territory and Local Governments for the development and maintenance of an effective disaster management structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully endorses the Committee's commendation of the Australian Defence Force for the very positive way in which it responds to requests for disaster assistance, and for the efforts made by Telecom during the 1994 NSW bushfires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In international terms, Australia can be proud of actions taken to date under the umbrella of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). These have been recognised internationally as examples of judicious expenditure of relatively small funds to enhance a wide range of emergency activities.  Of particular relevance to Australia among the mid-term strategies recently endorsed by the United Nations is the `involvement and active participation of the people in disaster reduction, prevention, preparedness, leading to improved risk management'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time, however, at this mid-point of the IDNDR to take stock of the Australian approach.  Increased State and Territory involvement in the activities of the IDNDR Coordination Committee and in implementing the themes of the Decade will be pursued.  The presence of these representatives, together with those from Commonwealth agencies, non-government organisations and academic and professional bodies, makes the Committee a valuable forum for wide-ranging discussion of emergency management issues and gives a variety of opportunities for raising the profile of the IDNDR as is recommended by the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 2&mdash;Pre-Disaster Phase&mdash;Preparedness</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of disaster mitigation and preparedness measures have been well recognised by the Committee and it is noted that 13 of the 45 recommendations in the report are found in this chapter.  These will require action from a number of Commonwealth agencies as detailed in the responses to the specific recommendations.  Of particular interest are those recommendations which discuss the use of geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing.  Recent developments in these technologies make their use in disaster management much easier and the Government intends to examine their use in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is mindful of the concerns raised in Recommendation 2 in relation to the preservation of records and the maintenance of functions of all Commonwealth agencies.  Agencies do not always give sufficient attention to these issues and there can be a tendency for agency emergency planning and counter-measures to be neglected even after periods in which major centres have been preserved from the effects of a substantial disaster.  This issue will be considered by the Commonwealth Counter Disaster Task Force (CCDTF) and steps will be taken to bring the subject to the attention of departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national uniform building code is highly desirable and progress on this is well advanced though the efforts of the Australian Building Codes Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the occurrence of a major mouse plague obviously raised the profile of such an event with the Committee, the majority of such plagues are very localised in their occurrence and in their impact on the economy.  The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management is supporting the development of a systematic and integrated approach to the management of such events. Meanwhile the Commonwealth, through the Grains Research and Development Corporation and CSIRO, is contributing funds to the search for long-term solutions to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of greater concern to the Government is the potential impact of major exotic animal disease outbreaks.  These could cause untold hardship to rural communities and suffering to animals as well as severe damage to the economy. The work of the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council (EXANDIS) over recent years has considerably enhanced the national capability to respond to such events. Methods of continuing this work will be included in a current review of Australia's long-term animal health requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 3&mdash;Disaster Phase&mdash;Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the Committee's view that the Commonwealth's response to requests for emergency assistance from the States and Territories is highly organised and that the current arrangements for seeking such support are suitable.  It also endorses the statements in Paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14 concerning the role of the Australian Defence Force in disaster response. While clearly willing to make the resources of the Australian Defence Force, as well as other Commonwealth resources, available to assist the States and Territories after disasters, the Government emphasises that these resources are maintained for other purposes.  The significant additional outlays in equipment and training to meet the potential needs that might be generated by the range of hazards which threaten Australia are not justified at the Commonwealth level given that, in general, primary responsibility lies with State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of Government Business Enterprises with specific roles and different funding arrangements has also raised new issues in relation to the funding of the Commonwealth response.  These issues require further examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 4&mdash;Recovery</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recovery is a key element of the disaster cycle and the return of individuals and communities to normal life after disasters is critical. Although most action is taken by States and Territories and non-government organisations, the Commonwealth provides a range of financial support to assist in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements be expanded to include a wider range of disasters and that a pamphlet be produced relating to Disaster Relief Provisions of the Social Security Act 1991.  Both of these matters are currently being examined in a wider review of Commonwealth financial support arrangements for recovery from disasters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 5&mdash;Zones of Commonwealth Responsibility</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While State and Territory governments have prime responsibility for safety of life and property of their citizens, there are a number of areas for which the Commonwealth also has a significant responsibility.  Among these are marine pollution, hydrographic surveying and aviation and some aspects of maritime search and rescue.  The Commonwealth also has certain specific responsibilities in relation to nuclear safety.  All these subjects are discussed in this chapter of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has raised a number of issues in relation to accidents at sea and marine pollution.  The Commonwealth has demonstrated its commitment to maritime safety and marine environmental protection over many years.  The responses given to Recommendations 17-22 demonstrate that this commitment continues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emergency preparedness at airports located near water was the subject of a recommendation.  This is a sub-set of the larger issue of air safety which is continuously addressed by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Federal Airports Corporation and other Commonwealth agencies in conjunction with State and Territory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent Research Reactor Review commissioned by the Commonwealth Government agreed with the judgement of relevant organisations that it is unlikely that an accident involving the research reactor at the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories would have any effects outside the boundaries of the establishment.  Nevertheless, cooperation between Commonwealth and State authorities takes place in planning for a response for such an event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that it should be demonstrating a standard of best practice in the field of emergency management on Commonwealth property and facilities.  EMA will assist relevant Commonwealth agencies to maintain this standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 6&mdash;Volunteers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Committee has not made any specific recommendations in relation to volunteers who play a key role in Australia's emergency management arrangements, it has identified a number of issues for consideration by States and Territories.  These have been referred to the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Paragraph 6.16, the desirability of sending key training personnel from voluntary organisations to the Australian Emergency Management Institute at Mount Macedon is identified.  Nominations for places on courses at the Institute are made by State and Territory authorities.  These authorities do nominate representatives of voluntary agencies to attend courses from time to time and the desirability of continuing this practice has also been drawn to the attention of nominating authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises and commends the vital and unselfish role which voluntary organisations play in all areas of disaster management.  The involvement of community-based organisations is an important characteristic of the Australian approach to emergency management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 7&mdash;Bushfire Management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inclusion by the Committee of a chapter on Bushfire Management is particularly appropriate in view of the experiences in NSW and WA earlier this year.  The Committee has highlighted problems with a lack of national standards in relation to communications and equipment.  These matters are currently being actively examined by relevant committees including the National Emergency Management Committee and the National Communications Advisory Group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation that CL-215 water bombing aircraft be obtained for trials in Australia has high-cost implications. The Committee has stated that the 1985 study of the use of fire bombing aircraft by CSIRO (Project Aquarius) has been strongly criticised and its results argued to be wrong.  The Government is unaware of any scientifically-based analysis of the Project which would support such a position.  A preliminary examination of the anticipated costs of further limited trials of a number of aircraft types was undertaken by the Government. It was considered that such trials should also re-examine the use of smaller aircraft and helicopters, since the case for their use appears to parallel that for the CL-215, if rather less stridently promoted.  The results of this examination were discussed with State and Territory Ministers responsible for emergency management matters in December 1994.  The majority view was that the cost of further trials was not warranted.  The Government undertook to continue to monitor developments in this field..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 8&mdash;Commonwealth Emergency Management&mdash;Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the final chapter of the report, the Committee has emphasised the need for the Commonwealth, through EMA, to play a greater role in preparedness planning, prevention/mitigation, training and recovery as well as disaster response.  Although EMA already covers all these aspects, particularly through its training arm at Mount Macedon, it is agreed that there is scope to increase the priority given to these components of emergency management. These matters will be considered in conjunction with the National Emergency Management Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has made a key recommendation that EMA be placed with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and that it be set up as an independent body with its own legislation and funding through a separate budget program.  The Government does not support this approach.  The management arrangements for EMA within the Department of Defence are working satisfactorily and no substantive argument has been provided to change these. The effect of Defence budgetary pressures on EMA is overstated.  Regardless of the location of EMA, it will not be removed from the need to justify its financial requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that EMA be established under separate legislation.  The Government is satisfied that the current administrative arrangements are satisfactory and does not see a need for specific legislation, notwithstanding that this approach has been adopted in some other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Civil defence is identified as a responsibility which should be given to EMA. The responsibility for civil defence operations has remained with EMA since its creation as the Natural Disasters Organisation in 1974. Responsibility for the development of civil defence policy was devolved to EMA in 1992 and a national policy was endorsed in principle by Government in December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Committee recommends that the CCDTF take on the wider role of coordinating forward planning of Commonwealth Government disaster relief systems, both short and long term.  The Government agrees that the Task Force should play a more active role in developing the policies which will produce a comprehensive and integrated approach to all aspects of emergency management at the national level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government commends the Committee on its valuable report which will significantly assist in strengthening Australia's emergency management arrangements. Effective emergency management in Australia depends on cooperation between Commonwealth, State, Territory and Local Governments working in partnership with the community.  There are many recommendations made by the Committee which the Commonwealth can implement. Nevertheless, constitutional responsibility for the protection of life and property rests with the States and Territories and complementary action is required.  This is already being discussed by the National Emergency Management Committee. Cooperation was developed further at a meeting of emergency management ministers which the Minister for Defence convened in December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that EMA (Emergency Management Australia) give higher priority to activities under IDNDR and in particular work towards gaining increased State/Territory commitment to their own IDNDR projects. (Paragraph 1.37)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. In support of the `Yokohama Strategy' and `Plan of Action for a Safer World', which were endorsed by countries attending the United Nations World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction held in Japan in May 1994, EMA is examining the Australian IDNDR program for the latter half of the decade. Membership of the IDNDR Coordination Committee will be reviewed with a view to obtaining representation from a wider range of disciplines. The States and Territories, previously represented by a single delegate, now have individual representation on the Committee. The committee will also be invited to raise the profile of the IDNDR, to support projects which have a practical impact on disaster mitigation and to seek ways to increase State/Territory commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that all Commonwealth agencies should have a counter-disaster plan to cover emergencies which may affect normal agency functions and damage or destroy agency-held records. To achieve this the Committee recommends that an inter agency Committee be established to determine a basic standard for Commonwealth agencies and to draft a blue print plan as a basis for all agencies. The Committee further recommends that the existence, scope and currency of agency plans be subject to formal mention in annual reports, and be subject to both internal and external auditing. (Paragraph 2.15)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Potential interruptions to the functions of Commonwealth agencies or potential damage to agency-held records could result from a variety of causes. These may range from small incidents such as common localised accidents, for example fire or water damage, up to major widespread natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, contingency planning of the kind suggested by this recommendation should be part of the normal arrangements considered by program managers and agency heads. In general, it is their responsibility to make risk assessments regarding such events and decide on the level of contingency planning required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that assessing the need for and capacity of agencies to maintain operations under extreme circumstances should be a normal part of program planning and administration, contingency planning would be within the current agency annual reporting and audit practices. Again, the level of priority given to reporting on such planning is a matter for the judgement of program managers and agency heads and is likely to reflect the level of threat and the importance of rapid business resumption assessed on an agency-by-agency basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, experience shows that agencies do not always pay the required level of attention to these issues particularly after long periods without major disasters. Attention of agency heads will be drawn to this by the Commonwealth Counter Disaster Task Force (CCDTF).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than an inter agency Committee, the CCDTF, in consultation with relevant bodies, will, in the near future, assess the need for broad guidelines for agencies to consider in planning for such contingencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . recommends that, as a project under the auspices of the IDNDR, States and Territories adopt nationally uniform building codes for improved disaster preparedness. (Paragraph 2.20)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Building Code of Australia, which is maintained as a joint initiative between the Commonwealth, State and Territory and Local Governments through the Australian Building Codes Board, is currently being further developed.  It is appropriate that development be continued by the Board rather than establish a separate project under IDNDR.  The code provides the technical basis for State and Territory building regulations and has been adopted by all States and Territories.  The Code covers all types of building.  It focuses on fire protection and building fire safety and also prescribes a comprehensive approach to protection from such events as high wind, earthquakes and progressive collapse.  The Code incorporates the latest developments in building standards (such as Australian Standard AS 1170.4: Earthquake Loading Provisions).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Standard AS 3959/1991: Construction of Buildings In Bushfire Prone Areas, is included in the Code.  This requires residential buildings in designated bushfire areas to be provided with protection to reduce the risk of ignition by embers during a bushfire. Although this Standard is not called up in New South Wales, a recent report of a New South Wales Parliamentary Select Committee on Bushfires has recommended its adoption in the State's Building Code.Nevertheless, many shires in the State require buildings in areas subject to bushfire hazard to be protected to the standard given in AS3959. South Australia has not accepted the Standard because it has a special requirement defined in a Ministerial specification.  AS3959 is being reviewed urgently and the new edition is expected to be called up in the Building Code of Australia on completion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that EMA explore the possibility of simulator training for other emergency scenarios, with a view to having at AEMI an array of simulators for use by State emergency services in training their officers. Funding for simulator technology would be on a Commonwealth/State cost sharing basis. (Paragraph 2.34)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMA has begun an evaluation of simulation systems available overseas to assess their suitability for use in Australia. The cost of obtaining and introducing simple systems may be covered by offsets within the emergency management financial support provided to States and Territories under a State Support Package.  Major simulation packages are expensive and the rationale for their use would need to be discussed in detail with State and Territory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that ADMIN be used as a model to establish an Australia wide network for information exchange specifically related to disaster management. (Paragraph 2.46)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.  Funding has been provided in financial year 1994-95 to provide further development of the Australian Disaster Management Information Network (ADMIN).  EMA is committed to supporting ADMIN as the Australia-wide network for disaster management information exchange and will also encourage links with other similar systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . recommends that EMA convene and coordinate a technical committee to evaluate geographic information systems with particular regard to disaster management and make recommendations as to the suitability of various types of systems. (Paragraph 2.53)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer a framework for assimilation of spatial data of value to disaster managers.  While standing data can be entered in slow-time, that relating to a current disaster will often only be available through remote sensing.  Consequently recommendations 6 and 7 are closely related.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of GIS has been recognised by the conduct of a national workshop in April 1994 at the Australian Emergency Management Institute (AEMI) in conjunction with Australasian Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (AURISA). As a result of this workshop, EMA and the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) are collaborating to develop the use of GIS in emergency management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMA is involved in a Natural Hazards GIS Working Group and has become the convenor of an AURISA standing public safety group. Both groups provide avenues for technical consultation and information exchange on ways of incorporating GIS capabilities into emergency management. The groups include representatives of Commonwealth and State agencies able to facilitate full evaluation of systems. Development of a pilot project on the comprehensive use of GIS for disaster management purposes in the city of Cairns has been approved for funding as an IDNDR project. The project will be conducted in conjunction with Queensland Government agencies. Commonwealth agencies, such as the Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group (AUSLIG), will be consulted in development of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that EMA, as part of the IDNDR, convene a specialist working group to evaluate remote sensing technologies and the relative merits of their application in Australian disaster management agencies. The Committee also recommends that support be given to CSIRO in its development and promotion of multi-spectral technology instruments. (Paragraph 2.59)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of aspects of remote sensing, including data acquisition and management, broad spectrum remote sensing and multi-spectral instrument capabilities can have a significant impact on Australia's ability to predict and manage disasters.  EMA intends to conduct a national workshop on remote sensing technologies to evaluate their application to emergency management in the Australian environment. The need for a specialist working group will be examined during the workshop, which will include participants from CSIRO, AUSLIG, AGSO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Bureau of Resource Sciences (BRS). France and New Zealand have also expressed interest in cooperating with Australia on the use of remote sensing technology in assisting the response to and recovery from disasters and emergencies in regional nations. EMA will examine the feasibility of including representatives from these nations in the national workshop and extending its scope to cover this wider approach to the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government provides funding to CSIRO on a global and triennial basis but does not specify the priority of activities against which funds are to be allocated. This is a matter for the CSIRO Board.  Recognising that there are a number of other priorities for CSIRO's research and development efforts, it is expected that the Organisation will continue to develop capabilities in the remote sensing and GIS fields at a rate determined by the availability of overall resources, collaborating where appropriate with such other agencies as EMA and the Bureau of Meteorology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently no Commonwealth-funded Key Centre for Teaching and Research in the field of earthquake seismology although a number of tertiary institutions are undertaking research in the broad field of seismology.  The Australian Research Council, which advises the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on research policy, agreed in February 1994 that there should be a new selection round of Key Centres for Teaching and Research with funding to commence in 1995/96.  $2.4 million per annum will be made available to support approximately eight new Key Centres.  The new selection round was advertised in the national press in September and universities were invited to submit up to three proposals.  The peer review process, which will be managed by the Institutional Grants Committee of the Australian Research Council, is rigorous and competition is expected to be very strong.  Applications will be assessed on merit, in terms of the excellence of the proposed research and the relevance of the proposed educational programs in the development of expertise in fields important to Australia's economic and social development.  Advice will go to the Minister on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee . . . recommends that a Rodent Plague Commission be established as soon as possible. (Paragraph 2.88)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is not supported. Commonwealth and State authorities agree that there is little that a Rodent Plague Commission could achieve over and above the work already being done by such bodies as the Grains Research and Development Corporation's Rodent Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that NDRA guidelines be reviewed with consideration given to include mouse plagues. There also is a need for a clear policy at federal level on the availability and use of strychnine. In the absence of a Commission, the Committee recommends that State governments maintain a stockpile of strychnine along with a plan for its distribution in the event of a severe mouse plague such as occurred in 1993 in South Australia and Victoria.  (Paragraph 2.89)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NDRA guidelines are being  reviewed as part of a widespread examination of emergency response policy.  The subject of mouse and other plagues will be included in the scope of the review.  The review team will liaise with the Vertebrate Pests Committee, the peak committee under the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management which has responsibility for mouse plague issues.  It should be pointed out that mouse plagues rarely fall into the `severe and unpredictable' category of events currently covered by NDRA.  Most such irruptions are localised and do not cause significant widespread economic loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the highly toxic nature of strychnine, the concerns of health and environmental authorities over its use, the fact that its use is only permitted in two States, and that a task force of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management is currently examining a more systematic approach to the problem, the recommendation concerning State government stockpiling of strychnine cannot be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the preparation and adoption of uniform national [exotic disease control] legislation by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories should be completed as a matter of urgency. The Committee further recommends that funding be maintained sufficient to allow bodies such as EXANDIS, which the States and Territories believe essential to planning processes, to be retained. (Paragraph 2.95)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation concerning uniform legislation is supported and it is noted that the achievement of such legislation is almost complete as a result of national endorsement of an Agriculture and Resource Management Council proposal of 1988.  By August 1994, uniform legislation had been implemented in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.  The legislation is included in the current programs of Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, while the legislative drafting process in Queensland is still under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989, which established the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council, cease to operate on 20 June 1995.  The major elements of the EXANDIS charter have been included in a broader review of Australia's long term animal health requirements;  exotic animal disease control is a core function of these requirements.  A proposal to establish a new tripartite national body comprising Commonwealth, State/Territory and industry interests is under active consideration.  Such a body would provide future focus on animal health policies, including those relating to exotic animal diseases.  Funding proposals are also being examined and it is expected that any Commonwealth funds provided will be subject to Government scrutiny in the same way as other budget funded programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the Committee has recommended in other parts of this report, that EMA must work closely with the States and Territories to develop comprehensive and integrated emergency planning, the Committee recommends that AMSA and EMA should make maritime emergency planning a model of best practice. (Paragraph 5.13)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMA and AMSA are both committed to the principle of `best practice' and continually review their plans and procedures in the light of developing knowledge. The two agencies have a close working relationship and cooperate in marine pollution planning and the arrangement of maritime support for other disasters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 18</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that AMSA in conjunction with EMA and relevant State and Northern Territory agencies develop a comprehensive emergency management plan for chemical transportation by June 1995. (Paragraph 5.20)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMA is participating with AMSA in planning for the response to maritime chemical transportation accidents, a process which involves a number of other Commonwealth and State agencies.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends . . . that funding be upgraded for the Australian Hydrographic Service sufficient to allow for identification of such routes and the production of a series of accurate National Charts and sailing directions suitable for modern navigation along them. Funding increases should be such as to allow a production rate of at least 25 charts per annum. (Paragraph 5.33)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) has already provided a new hydrographic facility in Wollongong and plans a 20 percent increase in civil staff over the next five years to permit production to increase to at least 25 charts per annum. CSIRO's Division of Oceanography has provided data relevant to chart production to the Australian Oceanographic Data Centre for many years and holds additional information of potential value for new chart production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the conventional charting program and in seeking to provide effective measures aimed at prevention of maritime disasters, the RAN Hydrographic Service, has begun a new program to support integrated electronic navigation systems through provision of a digital chart data base. Such systems (generally known as ECIDS) have the potential to reduce significantly the number of groundings caused by human error. Groundings are the type of casualty causing the highest number of oil spills world-wide. ECIDS is being promoted by the International Maritime Organisation as a technology offering significant improvements in navigation safety. There is widespread support for it in the international community and in Australia. The Navy is currently evaluating the merits of a project to provide a national ECIDS data base for providing progressive national coverage over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 20</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that AMSA, the CSIRO and the Australian Hydrographic Service review imaging spectrometer technology and determine whether it could be cost effectively utilised to improve navigation in Australia's waterways. (Paragraph 5.34)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The RAN Hydrographic Service already uses remote sensing techniques such as the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder in the collection of material for charts. The Hydrographic Service and CSIRO are already discussing the potential of imaging spectrometer technology and other remote sensing techniques which may have a positive contribution to make to safe navigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA is currently conducting trials of a Differential Global Positioning System which broadcasts a correction to Global Positioning Systems enabling navigation accuracy to within 10 metres to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new DGPS broadcasting station on Horn Island in the Torres Strait will be operational by October 1995. With the establishment of this station AMSA will insist on the compulsory use by pilots of transportable global positioning equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 21</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends . . . that the Commonwealth Government work internationally towards acceptance of compulsory pilotage in sensitive areas while establishing a register of such areas around Australia's coast with a view to their promotion for this purpose. (Paragraph 5.37)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been to the fore of international developments particularly in relation to safety of life at sea and marine environment protection. It works through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to achieve international agreement on such measures which may include compulsory pilotage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef has been declared a Particularly Sensitive Area by the International Maritime Organisation and pilotage through the reef is compulsory.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of AMSA's activities in relation to safety of life at sea and marine environment protection are predicated by a `prevention first' approach. This is reflected in the comprehensive range of international conventions that Australia has helped to develop and to have internationally endorsed, and subsequently implemented domestically through Commonwealth/State and Territory legislation. The `prevention first' approach will continue to be followed whenever there is an opportunity for Australia to influence the content of such conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 23</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the CAA be required to provide its own suitably equipped launches at all major airports located near water for use in emergencies. (Paragraph 5.48)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Search and rescue outside the boundaries of airports are the responsibility of State and Territory emergency management authorities although CAA accepts responsibility for rescue of persons and property from an aircraft that has crashed on, or in the vicinity of, an airport. The vicinity is identified as the area within 1,000 metres of the airport boundary. CAA intends to provide a first-stage response to aircraft crashes on water within this area by providing in-shore rescue boats crewed by trained aviation firefighters to provide an immediate rescue capability for aircraft occupants until the second stage, and more substantial, State or Territory rescue response arrives on the scene. The first boat was commissioned in Hobart on 1 July 1994.  Further boats are expected to become operational in Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns, Coolangatta and Mackay during the next few months.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Minister responsible require ANSTO to draw up a plan in consultation with the [Sutherland] Shire Council on matters relating to preparedness and planning at Lucas Heights, and in particular evacuation procedures for the Shire. (Paragraph 5.56)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no requirement to draw up additional emergency response plans relating to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories (LHRL). There have been detailed arrangements in place since the early 1960s which set down the actions to be taken by the relevant Commonwealth and State authorities in the remote event of an incident at the LHRL which has off-site consequences. These arrangements have been developed jointly between ANSTO and the relevant authorities including EMA. The enactment of the NSW State Emergency Management and Rescue Act 1989 required that the previous emergency management arrangements be reviewed. The new arrangements are in place and are being continuously refined as necessary by ANSTO and the State authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emergency arrangements for the LHRL are regularly exercised by ANSTO in conjunction with State and local government authorities. The new arrangements were the subject of a comprehensive exercise held by the State authorities and ANSTO in December 1993. Sutherland Shire Council officers participated in this exercise. Following the exercise, the Nuclear Safety Bureau, the Commonwealth body responsible for monitoring the safety of ANSTO's research reactors, concluded that the relevant emergency arrangements provide effective protection for site personnel and members of the public.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. EMA maintains links with relevant Commonwealth bodies through designated Disaster Service Liaison Officers and through the CCDTF.  These links will be used to remind Commonwealth bodies of the need to prepare and maintain, in conjunction with relevant State and Territory emergency management authorities, emergency plans for areas and resources under their jurisdiction. A review of Commonwealth policy on emergency management is currently being carried out by EMA before presenting that policy for consideration by Cabinet through the CCDTF.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO's Bushfire Research Unit is funded as a project within the Division of Forestry and its degree of financial support within the organisation is determined in relation to other priorities of the Division. The Unit's basic research is of national significance and is relevant to all States and Territories.  As bushfire management is a State responsibility, the Government considers that any additional funding for further research should be provided by the States and Territories. Collaborative work with State agencies is conducted on a project-by-project basis with States contributing operating funds and in-kind support. CSIRO would welcome initiatives from the States for further joint ventures to address the priorities identified in the Report.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) allocates radio frequencies to organisations and individuals throughout Australia in response to requests. Some requests are for allocation of specific frequencies while others are for allocation within a specific band of frequencies. As far as possible the Agency endeavours to meet these requests consistent with the need to ensure no interference is caused to existing users. The radio frequency spectrum is a finite natural resource and frequency availability is limited especially in major metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA and the former Department of Transport and Communications have for many years, through involvement with individual services and at a local government level, actively encouraged emergency services to coordinate their radio communications infrastructures.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government carried out a preliminary assessment of the cost of further trials of the capabilities of various aircraft and systems for aerial suppression of fire. The trials would need to examine the capabilities of various fixed and rotary winged aircraft using the latest suppression techniques and taking into account the capabilities of a number of recently introduced aircraft. It was established that the cost of the trials would be very high and that they would need to be carried out in collaboration with the States and Territories. The subject was discussed at a meeting of State and Territory Ministers responsible for emergency management matters which was convened by the Minister for Defence in December 1994. With the exception of South Australia, all agreed that there was no evidence that larger aircraft would be of any economic benefit in bush fire fighting.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted. EMA has drawn this recommendation to the attention of Western Australian members of the National Emergency Management Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 38</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee supports EMA's proposed change in focus it is important that EMA more clearly address in its corporate plan those other areas for which the Commonwealth can play a direct role: preparedness planning, prevention/mitigation, training and recovery as well as actual disaster response. While the Committee acknowledges that these elements are contained within the core functions which EMA sets itself, the Committee recommends that they be specifically addressed in the mission statement. (Paragraph 8.16)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. In the next revision of the EMA corporate plan the mission statement will be changed from:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`To promote and support effective emergency management in Australia and its region of interest'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`To promote and support comprehensive, integrated and effective emergency management in Australia and its region of interest'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change of emphasis has been included in the latest edition of the Australian Counter Disaster Handbook. This ensures that the approach recommended by the Committee is widely promulgated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMA has reviewed its Corporate Plan (1994-95) and is continuing to seek ways of developing flexibility and sensitivity in its program to enhance comprehensive emergency management. In future, EMA will examine further ways of developing the total national emergency management capability through increased emphasis on preparedness/planning, prevention/mitigation, training and recovery activities as well as disaster response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 39</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the importance of natural disaster reduction programs the Committee repeats its recommendation set out a paragraph 1.37 that EMA give higher priority to activities under IDNDR and, in particular, work towards gaining increased State and Territory commitment to their own IDNDR projects. (Paragraph 8.17)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The response to this recommendation is given in answer to Recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 40</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth and the States and Territories jointly commit more funds to the following critical areas of emergency preparedness: training, research, information collection and dissemination and public awareness. (Paragraph 8.18)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMA has been undertaking a review of its support for the activities mentioned. Greater flexibility in the use of State Support Package funds will facilitate reallocation of funds to these critical areas.  EMA has opened discussions with other Commonwealth agencies on methods used to develop alternative funding sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 41</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government make a clear commitment to the retention of the AEMI at Mount Macedon. The Committee regards the location of the Institute outside Canberra as an advantage and cautions against calls for its relocation on the basis of cost cutting. (Paragraph 8.19)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No final decision has been made on the facility at Mount Macedon. However, the Government has a predilection to retaining the Australian Emergency Management Institute at that location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 42</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that EMA be removed from the Defence portfolio and that it be placed administratively within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Committee further recommends that EMA be set up as an independent body with its own legislation and funding through a separate budget program. (Paragraph 8.22)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the current location of EMA has enabled it to carry out its planning and response tasks effectively, and has not adversely affected its performance or its resource base. As a sub-program with the Defence Portfolio, EMA is well able to relate to the relevant program areas within Defence that provide the bulk of Commonwealth physical and technical services which are supplied in times of emergency. Indeed, EMA's location in Defence is probably the most cost-effective way of addressing both its long-term planning and short-term response roles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moving EMA into the Prime Minister's portfolio would not, of itself, necessarily improve EMA's effectiveness in carrying out its mission. To the degree that major natural disasters require the capacity to coordinate physical and technical responses effectively, EMA has demonstrated that it is currently well-placed. In addition, as a key member of the CCDTF, chaired by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C), EMA liaises closely with PM&amp;C on strategic planning and, through this forum, also has a conduit to the Prime Minister in times of national emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Government policy that legislation should only be proposed when it is necessary, as a matter of law, to give effect to the desired policy. As stated in the Legislation Handbook: `Legislation should not be proposed simply to give a matter `visibility' if it can be implemented without legislation'. Moreover, EMA has operated successfully for over 20 years under administrative arrangements.  Hence, Commonwealth emergency management legislation is not considered necessary in the present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 43</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the Commonwealth is required to put in place effective civil defence planning the Committee recommends that this responsibility be given to EMA. (Paragraph 8.28)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. EMA already has this responsibility and is involved in policy, planning and other development activities. Two staff members are dedicated to the civil defence function. Courses and a range of awareness raising activities are also conducted at the Australian Emergency Management Institute and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 44</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Counter Disaster Task Force and the National Emergency Management Council (sic) take responsibility along with EMA for the development of an integrated approach to civil defence and emergency planning. (Paragraph 8.29)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that planning for civil defence and for emergency management should be integrated to the degree that there are common features and in the light of the Geneva Conventions Amendment Act 1991. EMA and the CCDTF gave consideration to this issue in the development of a Commonwealth policy on natural disaster response which was endorsed by the Government in December 1994.  A national civil defence policy developed under the aegis of the National Emergency Management Committee was endorsed in principle by the Government at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 45</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the [Commonwealth Counter Disaster] Task Force take on the wider role for which it was set up. That is, coordinating forward planning of Australian Government disaster relief systems, both short and long term. (Paragraph 8.30)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the broad role of EMA in forward planning for the Commonwealth physical and technical response to natural disasters. The other major components of Commonwealth response to natural disasters, financial support to the States through the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements and to individuals through the Disaster Relief Payments and Special Benefits provisions of the Social Security Act, are currently being reviewed in parallel with the development of a Commonwealth policy statement on natural disaster response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the Committee's recommendation the CCDTF coordinated the development of this policy statement, which was endorsed by the Government in December 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the CCDTF's current coordinating role is likely to be reinforced through this process, Government does not envisage that the CCDTF will take a significantly more detailed role in planning for natural disaster relief. It is likely that planning responsibility at the Commonwealth level will remain primarily with the key Commonwealth programs which provide the direct response to natural disasters.</PARA>

<PARA>It does not give me much pleasure to move this motion, because this government stands condemned for its incredibly short-sighted decision to increase the sales tax on non-luxury cars, which will have such a devastating effect on my home state of South Australia and on the state of Victoria. I am pleased that Senator Crowley is here, and I know that Senator Foreman was in here previously, because it is our state which has, after 10 years under state Labor governments, reached the stage of virtual economic ruin. Now, under Premier Brown's Liberal government, we are determined to do what we can to get the state's economy back on track. This unconscionable decision of the government will make the task just that much harder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobs are going to be lost in South Australia because of this tax grab by the government which, despite its rhetoric, is obviously not interested in keeping jobs and companies in South Australia. I highlight that by saying that, prior to this budget being brought down last Tuesday night, the premier wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and said some very important things which particularly concerned South Australia. One of the important things he said was that we must be aware of the added burden that an increase in new taxes would bring to specific regions within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia is particularly heavily dependent on the car industry for providing employment and prosperity in South Australia. Some 50 per cent of this nation's new cars are produced in South Australia; 9,000 South Australians are employed at General Motors Holden at Elizabeth and by Mitsubishi at Clovelly Park; and 25,000 people are currently employed in South Australia's growing component manufacturing sector, car dealerships sector and other associated industries. These jobs are going to be at risk if production slows or jobs are lost at either GMH or Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi has already said that, despite planning for a small increase in employment this year, there will now be no extra recruiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the unions in South Australia are disgusted with this budget measure. I am quite sure that if Senator Foreman was in the chamber, he would feel quite uncomfortable&mdash;he has a background in the vehicle industry. The secretary of the vehicle division of the Automotive, Foods, Metals and Engineering Union, Paul Noack, said this is `economic madness'. One of Labor's supporters, the secretary of the union is suggesting it is economic madness. He said the sales tax increase is `a disincentive, just when the industry needs support'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax on non-luxury cars will increase by five per cent, from 16 to 21 per cent, and this is going to add $330 million to government revenue in the next financial year. The price of popular non-luxury cars will increase by $500 to $1,600 and the average family car will now cost between $800 and $1,000 more. The cost of a standard Holden Commodore will rise from $23,554 to $24,570, a jump of $1,016. The price increase in cars alone will add 0.3 of a per cent to the consumer price index. Try to convince anybody who is involved in that industry or anybody who is about to purchase a car just how much this budget is going to help them!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says in Budget Paper No. 1 that the sales tax on non-luxury cars was reduced to 16 per cent as `an anti-cyclical measure in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>'. It goes on to say, `Strong growth in the economy has removed any need for a concessional rate.' I wonder what cuckoo land this government is in if it believes that strong growth has removed the need for the concessional rate. The increase in sales tax could not have come at a worse time. The Australian car industry has already been hit hard by the government's high interest rate policy and the increase in fringe benefits tax on company vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The falling value of the Australian dollar has also put an upward pressure on car prices. The demand for vehicles dropped by 27.9 per cent in April and new car registrations were already forecast to fall in the second half of 1995. One can only say, in the light of this budget, that they are now likely to plummet. There are predictions that there will be a severe downturn with the loss of some 25,000 car sales this year alone. The Managing Director of Mitsubishi Motors in my home state of South Australia, Mr Mike Quinn, has predicted that Mitsubishi sales this year will drop by about five per cent from 625,000 to 600,000. GMH predicts its sales production figures will drop from 650,000 to 630,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modelling by Access Economics shows that even after one year, the increased sales tax on non-luxury cars will result in sales being down by 2.32 per cent. The modelling shows that even four years later, the reduction in sales will settle at 0.92 per cent below the level that would have been applied if there had not been a sales tax increase. Even if sales do increase back to the pre-sales tax increase level, this will still be considerably below the 1985 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even before the announcement of the sales tax slug, Australian car makers were facing crucial investment decisions about their long-term commitment to production in Australia. This sales tax rise could be the final nail in the coffin for some of those companies; and for the decisions they may take in the future. Jobs and businesses are now at risk, particularly in South Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car industry still has not recovered completely from the recession we had to have and Labor is now hitting it again with another tax rise. The Australian Automobile Association has dubbed the sales tax rise as a lose-lose decision. The environment and road safety will lose out because older cars mean more pollution and possibly more accidents; the motor industry will lose out because of reduced sales; and the government loses out because the increases in sales tax will be offset by reduced sales. It seems that the government just does not learn from its past mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, when the luxury car sales tax was introduced, sales collapsed from about 18,000 to 6,500 per year, and the government lost $1 billion in revenue over three years. This measure means that motorists will be forced to keep their cars for even longer. This will have negative effects on both the environment and road safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Automobile Association says that Australian cars are already amongst the oldest in the Western world. They are on a par with Brazil and are not far behind Mexico and Greece. The slow rate at which we have been replacing our cars has seen the average age of our cars rise from 8.5 years in 1985 to over 10 years in 1995. In fact, half of the cars on Australian roads are now over 10 years old. This most ridiculous situation will now be exacerbated by the budget decision to increase sales tax. If this government really cared about the environment, it would make sure that the average age of our cars is consistently reduced, not increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, by its actions in the budget, is shooting Australia in the foot. It is also dealing a massive blow to South Australia, which has been virtually brought to its knees by the decisions of 10 years of state Labor government and economic mismanagement. It desperately needs to get debt and unemployment under control. Putting 34,000 South Australian jobs at risk is not the answer. To once again quote union official Paul Noack, it is `economic madness'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has miscalculated if it thinks it can persuade swinging voters to vote Labor at the coming election by putting up the price of family cars by $1,000. In many parts of my state of South Australia, a family car is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity. A car is absolutely essential for the vast distances that have to be travelled, particularly by people in more remote areas. It is absolutely essential for families to have cars. They need to be able to travel to do all the things that are essential in their daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future this government will rue deciding to put up the price of a car&mdash;which is absolutely essential for the wellbeing of people in these areas&mdash;at a time when such people are feeling the effects of other factors, such as a drought on top of an economic recession. This budget measure will backfire on the Labor government, as it rightly should. It stands condemned for this attack on South Australia, the job prospects of many South Australians and the future prosperity of my state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the debate on the government's increase in sales tax on new cars. I was very pleased to hear Senator Ferguson amend the motion to include Victoria. For a moment, I thought the Liberal Party had forgotten that Victoria had a car industry. I am very pleased that he did it. If he had not done it, I certainly would have. In Victoria, in particular&mdash;it can be said in Australia&mdash;the car industry is the backbone of the manufacturing industry generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a strategic industry that directly employs approximately 340,000 workers. But that is not the end of it. About 11 other industries are clustered around it. Glass, plastics, rubber tyres and textiles are perhaps the main ones. When all of them are added in, it becomes evident that more than half a million Australians depend on the car industry for their livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unbelievable that the government could have taken this step at a time when the sales of new vehicles are beginning to drop. We must be aware that volumes in the car industry affect the viability of the industry. If the government thinks it can push to this extent the manufacturers, which are hanging on by the skin of their teeth, it is running the risk that companies such as Ford and others&mdash;which are carefully monitoring the future of the industry and their participation in Australia&mdash;will eliminate up to half a million jobs. The backbone of the manufacturing industry has been hard hit in the last few years by the government's policy of reducing tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our tariffs are down to some 27 per cent at the moment, due to go down to 25 per cent, our trading partners in the region have tariffs ranging from 45 per cent to 100 or even 200 per cent. In this situation, it is utter folly to put pressure on an industry and to expect that the industry can simply recover from this new slug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It might be useful to look briefly at the background of the sales tax on the car industry. The tax on passenger motor vehicles was 20 per cent until the One Nation statement in February 1992. In that year, it was reduced from 20 to 15 per cent, obviously to undercut Fightback. This was because the 20 per cent WST made cars more expensive than the 15 per cent GST. The WST rate for commercial vehicles, four-wheel drives and motor cycles was left at 20 per cent. Car sales rose from 406,000 in 1992 to 460,000 in 1994. But orders have been falling markedly since September with interest rate rises. The forecast for 1995 was recently pared down from 470,000 to 435,000&mdash;a very dangerous figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look at some of the alternatives that the government could have employed if it wanted to get revenue out of the car industry. Tariff rates for passenger vehicles have been falling by 2.5 per cent a year since 1988, falling from 45 per cent in 1988 to a 15 per cent forecast for the year 2000. From 1 January 1996, the tariff will fall to 25 per cent. For an imported car, both tariffs and customs duty are payable. When we look at tariffs, our bound rate&mdash;that is, the rate we are obliged to maintain under the WTO treaty, the successor to GATT&mdash;is approximately 45 per cent. That means that we could easily raise tariffs to 40 per cent without infringing our obligations under the WTO treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proportion of imported cars sold here rose from 40 per cent in the March quarter 1994 to 47.5 per cent in the March quarter 1995. The April monthly figures show the trend is worsening. The rising value of the yen might offset this, although much of the growth of imports is from Korea and Malaysia, rather than Japan. The other area that we need to look at is the fact that the fringe benefits tax on company motor vehicles is proposed to be increased by about $120 million to pay for the concessions in the compliance review. This will mostly hit domestically produced cars, as fleet cars tend to be Commodores and Falcons. Once again, we must look at the government's policy, loading these two slugs on a car industry that is fighting for viability. Indeed, it is not too far fetched to say that it is fighting for its life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposal that the government should consider is to raise the car tariff to 30 per cent and hold it there for two years before starting to reduce it. If the government is out for revenue, this measure would raise $105 million in 1995-96, $175 million in 1996-97 and $210 million in 1997-98. The tariff phase-out would finish in 2003 at 15 per cent. We also suggest that the tariff on passenger four-wheel drive vehicles not used to carry goods&mdash;this would exclude utilities&mdash;be phased in up to the same rate as passenger cars over two years; that is, in 1994-95, 10 per cent, in 1995-96, 20 per cent and, in 1996-97, 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are options that the government could have employed if it was concerned to obtain revenue from the car industry but at the same time wanted to ensure that the car industry remained a viable centrepiece of our manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area the government could have looked at was gearing the sales tax to the fuel consumption rates of vehicles. For instance, one could develop a scale by looking at the ratio of litres per 100 kilometres so that: under 6.5 litres per 100 kilometres there should be no sales tax; between 6.6 and 7.8 litres, 20 per cent; between 7.9 and nine litres, 30 per cent; between nine and 10 litres, 35 per cent; and above 10 litres, 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That approach would ensure that the sales tax regime took into account long-term sustainability of car transport in our community. It is a principle that I believe sooner or later we will be forced to adopt. It should be sooner rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once again put the Democrats' severe disappointment on the record that the government has seen fit to increase the sales tax on the sales of cars. At a time when the industry is already in a downturn, the estimated loss of some 25,000 car sales will clearly put many sectors of that industry in jeopardy and the industry will continue to lose jobs which have already been on the downward trend in that industry. </PARA>

You have allowed this government to attack the car industry in South Australia and attack every South Australian by this outrageous increase in taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government ignores the fact that South Australia is in serious economic trouble after having Labor governments running the place for so very long. Now they have increased the tax by 37 1/2 per cent on the car industry, which is vital to South Australia. This is not a five per cent increase. This is a 37 1/2 per cent increase to Mr Keating in the taxation payable on cars. That is what we are talking about here&mdash;and it impacts on South Australia most severely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Australian economy, after so many years of Labor government at state and federal level, is the lowest growth economy in Australia, has some of the lowest wages in Australia and is the most fragile economy in Australia after Tasmania. The car industry is vital to that economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ferguson said, over half the new cars produced in Australia are produced in South Australia. Thirty-seven thousand South Australians are employed in the industry and two of the four manufacturers are based in South Australia. It is an industry that is absolutely vital to the state&mdash;and here we have the Labor government, the friend of the workers, attacking that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is that this government ignores the regional problems in Australia. We have two economies in Australia: Queensland and Western Australia are growing at a massive rate, and the three southern states are in real trouble after so many years of Labor government and Labor ignorance of their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bet you this government has made absolutely no assessment of the regional impact of this decision. It just says, `We have to get more money from somewhere. We conned the voters back in 1992 on this thing. We dropped the tax to match Fightback. Now the 1993 election is over, let's whack the tax back up, because we think the voters are fools anyway, and ignore completely the consequences of this tax on South Australia and the regional impact of this tax.' They have ignored it completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson has quite rightly pointed to the consequences of this. It completely ignores the government's rhetoric about the environment. It means that Australians will continue to drive older cars. Our car fleet is already virtually the oldest in the Western world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a regressive tax because it will hurt the people that Labor professes to represent, particularly young people who cannot afford new cars.

It was a Labor government which introduced the Button car plan&mdash;and it ought to be called the Button car plan because it was John Button's drive, initiative, wit and intelligence that got the industry together with the government and the unions to create the great culture change that that industry needed&mdash;and now it is a world competitive industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr Acting Deputy President, these fools opposite do not understand that when you export a car, you pay no sales tax on it. We are talking about growth in the export industry. They do not pay sales tax at all; therefore, they are not affected by it and the export industry continues to grow. </PARA>

Back in the early 1980s, when your policies were in operation, all the economic gurus said, `The car component industry in Australia is certainly dead and finished. It's got no future. It is inefficient. It only relies on quotas and high tariffs. It's got no future. It cannot be competitive.'</PARA>

Yes, it reduced tariffs sensibly, reduced the protection, but also provided the export facilitation plan to encourage exports, to get the car industry out of your mind-set, which is only the domestic market. I have to pay tribute here not only to the management of the car industry but also to the trade unions in the car industry in Australia, who accepted the challenge and the need for change in an enormous way.

Again, a very good case of amnesia has overcome Senator Minchin. I will just mention a few things to remind him of what the federal Labor government has done in South Australia in the last decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not dispute with Senator Minchin&mdash;it would be crazy for me to try, and I would not try&mdash;the impact of the collapse of the State Bank in South Australia. My party, at the state level, has copped it absolutely hard. It has suffered the biggest electoral defeat since the party was formed because of the public's view about responsibility for the State Bank collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly cannot ignore that the public made its judgment, nor the fact that the collapse of the State Bank has had a major economic impact on South Australia. But I suspect its psychological impact on the community's confidence is even greater than the size of the economic losses from the collapse. I acknowledge that, and the Labor Party, both state and federal, has paid an extremely high price in South Australia. At the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced $600 million in compensation for the sale of the State Bank. Despite the change of government in South Australia, 80 per cent of that $600 million has now been paid, even though the bank has not been sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think over $450 million of that money has been paid into the state budget. I will bet Stephen Baker is very grateful that it has been paid. That was negotiated by the previous state Labor government with the federal government and the Prime Minister before the last election. That is $600 million for South Australia for a mistake for which the federal Labor government was in no way responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin asked what else we have done. I remember that in the mid-1980s we made sure that the federal Labor government took a decision to ensure that the submarine contract went to South Australia. An excellent proposition was put forward with the full support of the South Australian community, including the trade unions, the Chamber of Commerce and the opposition. It was bipartisan. The community of South Australia performed very well in bringing maximum resources to bear to win that contract with an excellent bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have to say that that occurred in the face of extremely stiff competition from areas where people would normally have expected this contract to be let&mdash;Sydney, Melbourne or Newcastle, the more traditional shipbuilding areas of Australia. The federal Labor government took a decision and said, `We will build a greenfield submarine facility in South Australia from scratch.' That was a $4 billion contract. It has created thousands of jobs and given critical mass to high-quality engineering jobs in South Australia. That was a decision that a strong federal Labor government was able to make against strong opposition and weight coming from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle demanding that this is where we would normally expect the project to go. Do not tell me that the submarine project was not of major benefit to South Australia. </PARA>

These are all areas of regional support into South Australia. They are specific federal government policies. For Senator Minchin to say that South Australia has been ignored is absolutely preposterous. The opposition should not complain about the level of sales tax on cars. For 30 years post-war whilst the opposition was in government it always supported sales tax rates at the same level. Now the opposition complains that it has risen to that level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to commence this Senate debate on the government budget, a budget brought down at a critical time in Australia's history when continued economic recovery is so vital after the devastating recession Mr Keating and his government inflicted on Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of tests that this budget must pass. It seems to me that the first is whether it is consistent with the government's election promises. Obviously, the answer is no. This government, and Mr Keating in particular, promised no new taxes and no increases in taxes. He breached that promise in his first budget, the 1993-94 one, and this compounds that breach of promises. Taxes go up at an extraordinary rate. Estimated total tax revenue in this budget goes up by 13.2 per cent. Estimated income tax&mdash;company and personal&mdash;revenue and individual income tax revenue go up by 13.5 per cent. These are huge increases. Overall estimated revenue in this budget goes up by 12.8 per cent. If this increase is realised, it will be the third highest rate of increase in the postwar period, a rate exceeded only by Mr Whitlam's first budget and Mr Keating's second budget in 1984-85. It reinforces not only that people cannot believe Labor but that Labor is the high tax alternative in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second test is whether this budget addresses the chronic current account problem this country faces. Again, the answer is no. This year's current account deficit is expected to come in at about $27 billion. What is the budget forecast for the budget year? Another $27 billion, or approximately six per cent of GDP. I remind honourable senators that is the percentage that Mr Keating used to refer to as a banana republic figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the question is whether the budget addresses our frightening load of foreign debt and the threat that that debt poses to our national economic sovereignty. Again, the answer is no. Foreign debt remains at a net figure of $160 billion&mdash;up or down a bit depending on the value of the dollar&mdash;a staggering figure, really beyond comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question is: will the budget provide economic growth necessary to adequately address our appalling level of unemployment? Again, the answer is no. The government's own green paper on unemployment said that to bring down unemployment&mdash;that is, to the government's goal of five per cent by the year 2000, which was already an incredibly high figure&mdash;we would need continual annual growth of 4.5 per cent. Yet this budget projects growth falling to 3.75 per cent. Mr Keating is on record as saying that any economy that cannot travel at four per cent without spilling over to imports should give the game away. He said that we ought to be able to run this economy at four per cent at least. Yet this budget projects a drop below that four per cent. Mr Keating fails his own test. But, more importantly, the hope dims for hundreds of thousands of Australians who are still out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will this budget take pressure off interest rates so that business might be encouraged to grow and prosper? Again, unfortunately, the answer is no. Total government real expenditure is not substantially reduced. The figure is only about three per cent&mdash;a bit less than three per cent, in fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the deficit reduction, of course, fudged by the hoped for capital repayment, the real figure&mdash;the underlying deficit figure&mdash;remains at something over $8 billion. If you add to that the current account failure that I mentioned a moment ago, realising, of course, that that will continue to put pressure on the dollar and that interest rates will have to stay up to protect the dollar, then there is little hope for a fall in interest rates as a result of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second last point is: will it in fact contribute to savings? Again, at least in the short-term, the answer obviously is no. In the longer term, maybe; but that is a debate in itself&mdash;something that will not be known for some years. If you argue that one of the major economic issues facing Australia is how to address our savings shortfall, there is no answer in terms of the next few projected years in this budget. So on seven obvious, critical tests the budget fares poorly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budgets, however, are not just intellectual exercises. They contain decisions and choices of government which have massive impact on people's lives. It is worth reflecting that this is the government which gave us the worst recession in 60 years; which gave us the highest level of unemployment since the 1930s; which provided the economic stewardship which led to the highest interest rates since the Great Depression; and which produced record bankruptcies and record liquidations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a government with an appalling economic record and with so much of its failure being directly the result of the errors of judgment of one man: Paul Keating. So much of the economic failure and personal misery which has resulted therefrom lies at the feet of Paul Keating. For 12 years he has pulled the levers. No longer can he blame the previous government. No longer can he blame the drought, or the world economy or someone else. It is time he accepted the failure of his policies, the failure of his performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, look at unemployment. Nothing so saps the confidence of individuals and undermines their personal dignity as unemployment. This government claims success in the battle against unemployment; yet, on today's figures, 765,000 Australians are still looking for work. The unemployment rate in Australia still remains 8.3 per cent. For adolescents it is more than three times that&mdash;26.5 per cent. That is why students were so angered by his recent `get a job' jibe. Mr Keating does not understand that they cannot get a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the tragedy of long-term unemployment, we will see that the figures have not improved markedly. In 1993, 37 per cent of unemployed were long term&mdash;out of work for more than a year. In 1994 the figure had dropped to just 36 per cent&mdash;the slightest of drops. Let us look at the even longer term unemployed. In 1992, 43 per cent of long-term unemployed were unemployed for two years or more. In 1993 it had gone up to 52 per cent. In 1994 it had gone up to 56 per cent. Some success record!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In international terms, we do not fare well at all. Compare our performance, Mr President, with other OECD economies. In December last year the USA, the UK, Germany and Japan all had lower levels of unemployment than Australia. Japan's level was three per cent. Some people think that is exaggerated. How often does this government look at the Asian experience when it is trying to equate Australia's economic performance and unemployment performance? It is a highly unsatisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that there were some pleasing figures today, the consistent signs are that employment growth is again weakening&mdash;tragic signs, in fact. DEET's leading indicator of employment has declined for six consecutive months since peaking in September. In its commentary on the March figures, DEET said that continued decline in the indicator suggests that growth and employment would peak and begin to fall in the second half of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have an election in the second half of this year, it is because the government believes that unemployment is going to start rising again, and of course interest rates are going to rise with it. DEET's skilled vacancy survey index also has been declining for several months. The ANZ's job advertisement series fell for the third  consecutive month in April. As I said, even with the growth projected in this budget, the situation cannot be improved. So it cannot be improved on the government's own figures. What does it do? In addition to that, in this budget it decides that it is time to slash funding for training. It is an obscure logic that calls for a slash in training funding at a time when unemployment not only is so high but also is likely to rise again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is typical Paul Keating. We have had the jobs white paper. The problem is solved and now he is on to the next issue. It simply demonstrates not only how out of touch he has become but also how insensitive he is to the real issues in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at poverty. Of course, unemployment and poverty are related. The government boasts of its social welfare and welfare spending. However, the increase in welfare spending might as easily be viewed as an index of Labor's failure to achieve and maintain a sustainable rate of economic growth and full employment. Unemployment and poverty have become permanent social scars after 12 years of Labor government. A recent study by two ANU economists showed that since the mid-1970s a significant gap had emerged between low income, low employment neighbourhoods and high income, high employment neighbourhoods. Low incomes have been falling under Labor and high incomes have been rising. Children suffer as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recently published survey of data found&mdash;these figures are really appalling&mdash;that 400,000 children are living in poverty, 200,000 children are homeless, there are 50,000 cases of reported child abuse each year, we have the highest rate of teenage suicide in the world and we have high levels of mental health disorders, tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse. Is this the Australia that we want?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When noted social commentator Hugh Mackay talked about the development of an underclass, Mr Keating and Labor simply scoffed. How often we say to Mr Keating, `Listen to the messengers; don't always knock the messengers.' But Mr Keating knows better&mdash;in his lifestyle and in his circle there is little poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about ordinary middle Australians&mdash;not the wealthy, not those living in poverty? In this budget they find the cost of their car rising by about $1,000 and the cost of a house rising by about $2,000. These were the people who voted for Labor at the last election because Mr Keating promised them no new or increased taxes. The same people who had to pay higher fuel prices as a result of the indexation can again expect another rise in wholesale sales taxes in July, already legislated but which sometimes the community forgets. These are the same people that Labor says should save more, without understanding that under Labor with its taxes, its interest rates and its costs these people simply do not have the discretionary income to save more. It is again Labor and, particularly, Mr Keating, who are out of touch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in company tax falls into the same category. Mr Keating says that some large businesses can afford it. Maybe so. But a lot of small businesses are incorporated. Another three per cent tax hike in company tax with added bank charges and probably added phone bills and postal charges flowing through from this budget will cause them to suffer greatly. In other words, not only are these tax increases a specific breach of promise, a part of Mr Keating's campaign of deceit at the last election, but also they will also harm the recovery and hurt middle Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians do not like being deceived and they are angry about a Prime Minister who is so out of touch. I mentioned interest rates. The effect of this budget on interest rates is so important. Nothing stops small business in its tracks like rises in the cost of its finance. It is a lesson Labor should have learnt in the late 1980s and early 1990s when Mr Keating forced up interest rates to dampen demand in an effort to answer the current account decline and gave us the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the budget in which we were told to expect the substantial expenditure cuts as an alternative to pushing up interest rates and they simply did not occur. With inflation on the rise, with no improvement in the current account and a government which has baulked at major cuts in its own cloth, it is not surprising that most Australians fear a government reverting to type&mdash;that is, a government prepared to push up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians remember that this government gave Australia the highest housing mortgage rates in 50 years. In fact, its irresponsible budgeting has meant that housing mortgage interest rates have been in double figures for all but 19 months of the last 12 years, and now they are in double figures again. Australians remember that from 1980 to 1990 housing interest rates went up to 17 per cent before the property market crashed and before the onset of the `recession we had to have'. Interest rates are now rising again. There have been three official interest rate increases since last August. If we look at the 90-day bill futures, we see that the finance market expects them to rise further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I remind you of what the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, said only a few months ago. He said that interest rates were still on the agenda even with a big cut in the deficit. Of course, a big cut in the underlying deficit simply did not come. Regrettably, all the signs are that the government has not learnt the lessons of the past. We are constantly reminded that Mr Keating is a big-picture man. If he is not prepared to look at the lot of individual Australians and the hardships they suffer under his management, perhaps he should reflect on the big picture. In March, the current account deficit was $2.3 billion, the second highest on record; for seven of the last eight months, the current account deficit has been above $2 billion. It has been nine years since Mr Keating gave his warning on a banana republic and nothing has changed. The pattern continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's net foreign debt has doubled in a decade under Labor from around $80 billion to over $160 billion. A debt of that size, accumulated within a decade and spent on consumption, is an enormous burden on the next generation. The size of the debt and the debt service liability makes us especially vulnerable to fluctuations in international economic conditions and puts our economic sovereignty at risk. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has plunged Australia into recession and debt. Household debt is still at an extraordinarily high level. Now we are slipping in the income stakes. Honourable senators would have noticed that in the last year both Hong Kong and Singapore passed Australia on an income per capita basis. Who would ever have believed that 10 years ago? It would have been beyond comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senior economists from the Asia-Pacific Economics Group at the ANU recently said that Australia's economic performance is poor. They said that the strong recovery from the recession was the wrong recovery, driven by domestic demand, including fiscal expansion in an economy with high foreign debt and a weak current account&mdash;Mr Keating should take note. Australians sense that something is seriously wrong, but, of course, it will not be addressed by Mr Keating because that would be to admit error and, to some extent, failure. The message, unfortunately, will not be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is a failure. On Paul Keating's own criteria it is a failure. It fails to reduce the fundamental deficit in the government's accounts. It fails to address the chronic problem of excessive spending, the chronic current account deficit, the accumulated foreign debt and the threat posed to our national economic sovereignty. It fails to produce a framework for sustainable economic growth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fraudulent document. Not only does it withdraw the promised tax cuts&mdash;the l-a-w legislated tax cuts&mdash;it replaces them with some of the largest revenue increases imposed in postwar budgets. Only Mr Keating would so insult the Australian people. After 12 long years, it is time for a fresh start. It is time for a different approach to the management of the economy, for a government which is prepared to take the hard decisions. It is time for a total change to the approach of government. It is time to introduce a new honesty into government&mdash;a prime minister who will tell the truth at election time. It is time for a prime minister who accepts parliamentary responsibility and is prepared to answer the parliament on each sitting day. It is time to be rid of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the report of the two eminent economists from the ANU who posed this question: as the current account widens and the economy slows in an election year, Australians may wonder about their economy's relatively poor performance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a good speech, Senator Hill. This is a clever budget. It is not a particularly responsible budget and it is not a particularly honest budget; but it is a clever budget. It is clever because its net effect and its real impact on the Australian community cannot be determined until after the next election. It is clever because its fundamental, fiscal integrity cannot be determined either until after the next election. It is a budget which reflects the government's No.1 priority; and that priority is not about reducing the current account deficit, getting unemployment down or moving towards a more equitable society. The priority is about getting its government re-elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we put the budget in that context, its cleverness becomes apparent. With an eye on the markets and an eye to the next election, the government has brought down a budget which has plenty of up front gloss and, despite what we just heard, there are some positive things in this budget. But beneath its glossy surface, I think, lie some serious shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the very first page of the budget papers we are told of a $718 million surplus. Buried well down the list, 400 pages later, we are told that the real budget outcome is a deficit of $8.2 billion. That is the figure which the Commonwealth uses when it talks to the states. That is the figure used by the Reserve Bank and by Treasury. But a deficit of $8.2 billion does not have quite the same pre-election ring to it as the magic word surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity the government has tried to dazzle us with that magic word. It is a pity it has opted for what is essentially a dishonest ploy of claiming a surplus. I am not alone in thinking it is quite incredible that the coalition has let the government off the hook on its claims, by the opposition's decision not to support a Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite resorting to trickery, the government has delivered a fairly tough piece of fiscal tightening. The deficit has been reduced by $3 billion and, in anyone's book, that is quite a tough clawback. I wish to state on the record that the Australian Democrats accept the government's true fiscal outcome of an $8.2 billion deficit but we have always reserved the right to show the government how we believe its objectives could be achieved in a way which is fairer and more economically, socially and environmentally responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this budget we also have the responsibility to question the basis upon which the government has achieved its alleged surplus. We have a responsibility to point out that the outcome of this budget changes according to whomever the government is talking to. When the states put out their hands for money, we are still in deficit but when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is out and about selling the budget to the Australian people, we are magically in surplus. The simple fact acknowledged by every economic commentator in Australia after the budget is that we are not in surplus. This surplus depends upon achieving $5.35 billion worth of asset sales. That is a task which, on past performance, the government will go nowhere near achieving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have always determined our decision on privatisations on a case by case basis and we have been strongly critical for many years of the government's indiscriminate approach to the sale of public assets. We put on the record our commitment to retaining certain key public assets. Our belief is that the benefits of privatisation are often greatly overstated and frequently result in additional costs being borne by taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are reasons for supporting the sale of assets but we cannot see too many good reasons for supporting the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We will continue to oppose that because the recent history of banking in this country has proven it to be non-competitive. In such an environment, we believe the government needs to have a role in setting some standards. If we take the example of superannuation and the recent history of it in this country, the only way the government could get the superannuation funds to deliver a fairer deal on fees was for the government to threaten to use the Taxation Office as a competitor. That is one reason, we believe, why the government should not give up one of the few means of influence it has over banking in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, the argument against privatisation appears to be further strengthened by the threat of the government's disregarding the rights of existing shareholders. I saw Mr Costello on tonight's news threatening to block the bank's sale. Anyone who believes the government can and will raise $5.35 billion from asset sales and then deliver a surplus probably also believes that the world is flat and that Elvis is still alive and well. In fact, it is almost easier to believe that Elvis is alive than it is to swallow some of the lines in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, it is pretty difficult to believe that the government can take an extra $1 billion in dividends and debt redemption out of government business enterprises without having any impact on their services. There will be reduced programs and increased customer charges, such as the cost of local telephone calls. It is also pretty difficult to believe that the government can take $1.2 billion out of labour market programs over four years without that having a detrimental effect on unemployed Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty difficult to believe that the government can redefine the meaning of `indexing of inflation', use it to take $2 billion over four years out of Commonwealth grants and then claim that that will not have any effect on public and community sector programs. That last cut is a particularly insidious one which deserves very close scrutiny. The Commonwealth has a huge range of financial agreements which could be affected by these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the funding line are those community based services which target the least well-off in our community: the sick, the aged, the disabled, veterans, the users of public hospitals and child-care centres, and indigenous Australians. If these indexation arrangements ultimately impact upon these sorts of services&mdash;there is absolutely no reason to suppose that they will not&mdash;it will actually make a mockery of the government's family friendly budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are positives in this budget. The environment portfolio has done reasonably well with long awaited funding for a coasts inquiry and for restructuring of the forestry industry. The Democrats have been lobbying for both of these initiatives for a long time. We welcome them. We are still disappointed that they are underfunded. But the response on greenhouse gases is an incredibly token one which is certain to be ineffective. We are disappointed about the government's continuing lack of interest in using the taxation system to encourage better environmental outcomes. In fact, in this budget, the contrary has occurred, with higher taxes on recycled paper and higher taxes on low polluting new cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another positive is the long overdue recognition of the need to assist workers with family responsibilities. In this case, it takes the form of what I think is a horrible term&mdash;the baby bonus. However, we are still ranked third last in the OECD in terms of the maternity assistance that we provide. But this is at least a start. Overall, as a package for families, the budget is pretty thin. Take Australia's poorest families&mdash;sole parent families. They get a $2 per week increase in the guardians allowance in 1996. Boy, that is generous; it starts then. There is then the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme threshold for general patients. That will have a very severe impact on families with chronically ill members or disabled family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy increase is generally supported by the Democrats. However, we have concerns about where that additional revenue is being directed. We have asked the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to indicate how much of that revenue will find its way into new or additional health programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget contains an ambitious and far-reaching plan to increase national savings through superannuation. As we would know from the debate a couple of years ago, the Democrats have never objected to compulsory savings. But arising out of this move there are five key questions which the government needs to answer on the superannuation proposal. Firstly, what consideration is being given to the likelihood that the superannuation contribution will reduce the disposable income of low income families when they most need the money, which is during their younger years? Secondly, recognising this, what consideration will be given to allowing access to superannuation for life cycle needs, such as housing, retraining or additions to the family?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, how will the $4 billion of superannuation contributions be funded? Fourthly, what happens if enterprise bargaining fails to extend superannuation across 80 per cent of the work force as predicted? In any event, what happens to the other 20 per cent of the workers? Fifthly, will the government now proceed to improve the interface between superannuation, taxation and the pension to reduce the effective 60-plus per cent tax rates faced by retirees on less than average weekly earnings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the government has given the superannuation industry another giant free kick&mdash;ownership of this nation's pool of capital&mdash;the Democrats believe it has an obligation to respond to these critical questions. As I indicated earlier in my speech, this budget represents a physical tightening of about $3 billion and the vast bulk of that tightening, some $2.4 billion, comes in the form of taxes. So let us talk about the three letter word tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, the Democrats have always recognised that deficit reduction, if it is not to adversely affect unemployment and the social safety net, needs to be a combination of expenditure cuts and revenue raising measures. We have also called on the government to use this opportunity to make the tax system fairer. The Democrats remain concerned about the impact of the company tax rise on small business, and we will certainly be putting forward proposals to address this problem. We would have preferred to have seen the government crack down on those companies not paying their fair share at the moment, those which are paying less than 20c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to provisional tax, the government wants to keep the uplift factor at three times the inflation rate. We opposed that last year; we are not convinced that it is needed this year. We will be very interested to see whether this time around, unlike last year, the coalition will actually join us in doing something for small business on this matter. </PARA>

The budget is lacking in any vision of hope for a direction to take this nation into the next century.

It is a budget that will ultimately be the swan song of the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissatisfaction of the financial market was demonstrated by the immediate dive of the dollar by almost a whole cent. The vast majority of Australians will not be deceived by this budget, based as it is on broken promises, misleading financial statements and asset stripping. The prevailing economic indicators are grim and highlight the government's complete inability to manage the economy. The government's own forecast of a $27 billion current account deficit by the end of the financial year at six per cent of the GDP is dangerously close to a banana republic, and it is a massive $9 billion blow-out on last year's forecast. Inflation is rising to four per cent. Interest rates rose three times last year. While the official cash rate is now 7.5 per cent, small business and farm enterprises are paying interest rates in the region of 13 per cent and up to 17.5 per cent for highly geared businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is over 8 per cent, including 270,000 long-term under-employed and 300,000 under 25-year-olds. The net foreign debt is over $160 billion and the gross foreign debt is over $200 billion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Largely through one-off asset sales totalling $5.3 billion and some creative accounting measures the government has turned last year's budget deficit of $12.2 billion into a $718 million surplus. </PARA>

When we come into office the asset cupboard will be bare just like Mother Hubbard's. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget sees the imposition of a tax burden totalling $2.4 billion for this financial year and going up to $16.7 billion in the future. This unprecedented raft of tax hikes takes the form of: the increase in company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, collecting $230 million for this year, rising to $1.5 billion in 1996-97; an increase in sales tax on passenger motor vehicles by 5 per cent initially from 16 per cent to 20 per cent and then to 21 per cent on 1 July 1995 when all sales tax rates rise one per cent automatically; the imposition of 12 per cent sales tax on the family home; an increase in the Medicare levy; an increase in the fringe benefits tax in line with the Medicare levy rise and then a further increase from 1 April 1996; and a 10 per cent rise in the tobacco excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget the government finally abandons its longstanding promise to deliver the second tranche of the One Nation l-a-w tax cuts worth around $4 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a deal worked out with the ACTU and will be implemented through the award system, not by legislation and will therefore exclude around 30 per cent of workers not covered by an award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With every budget this government finds more areas in which to extend its taxation tentacles, despite going to the people at election time with promises of tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget contains expenditure cuts to areas including $1.2 billion from the labour market programs of last year's $3 billion Working Nation program. There are also across-the-board departmental running costs savings of $162 million this year and $662 million over the next four years, cuts to pathology services of $46 million this year and $224 million over four years and a tightening of the safety net threshold for the pharmaceutical benefits schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 1995-96 budget contains little in the way of hope for rural and regional Australia. Australia is still experiencing the worst drought this century despite some helpful rainfall at the end of last year. It appears that the drought is set to stretch through until 1995. I welcome the drought assistance measures that will total $519 million by 1997-98 and the primary industry minister's commitment that drought relief payments, which have to date assisted around 10,000 producers, will continue through this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the projected drought has caused farm production to plummet, particularly in the grain production areas. This decrease in primary production and consequent decrease in exports have shaved 0.75 per cent from GDP last year and was the significant contributor to blowing out the current account deficit. This indicates the important role rural Australia and the diverse rural industries continue to play in underpinning the wealth and living standards of this nation. Yet in this budget, despite the level of drought assistance, the agricultural sector with forestry and fishing account for only 1.5 per cent of total outlays. Producers contribute around $703 million to this budget through a variety of taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the government baulked at making any changes to arrangements of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The government obviously formed the view that it would have had a fight on its hands if it tried to abolish or reduce in value the successful diesel relief payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the government reduced road funding by almost 20 per cent&mdash;around $200 million. This year the government has maintained funding at that low level. This is despite the fact the government's total fuel excise grab for 1994-95 will be in the region of $10 billion&mdash;yet its contribution to road funding continues to decline. There is no commitment by this government to rural and regional Australia when it neglects to such a degree such fundamental infrastructure as the national road system. This is symptomatic of the government's attitude to rural and regional Australia: when it cannot be taxed, it should be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget does nothing to address the growing divide between urban, rural and regional Australia. Rural and regional Australia accounts for 70 per cent of Australia's export wealth and contains 28 per cent of the population, yet the gulf in essential services, employment prospects and lifestyle between city and the bush has never been wider. A war of attrition is being waged on rural Australia, and this budget provides no ammunition for the rural heartland to combat this decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As population decreases from closure of services, local shire councils find it increasingly difficult to maintain a rate base essential to provide basic services such as roads and water supply. Yet this budget makes no acknowledgment of this decreasing revenue base and instead provides local government with funding representing only 0.67 per cent of total outlays. This is less in real terms than when the government came to office 13 years ago. I ask: do we want a country that has lost its rural heart with a population that sprawls for miles out of the capital cities, particularly Sydney? If this is the vision that this government has for Australia, for once it is on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if we want to encourage regional economic development, policies which promote the retention of essential services for rural dwellers must be fashioned instead of policies that are positively detrimental to the inhabitants of regional Australia. One such example is the government's levying of the fringe benefits tax on the mining industry's provision of housing to its employees. This has led to the development of fly-in fly-out schemes. Transporting employees to the mines is not subject to fringe benefits tax, while housing, electricity, water and vehicle allowances are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of fringe benefits tax in this manner has led mining companies to increasingly reject the notion of setting up permanent mining towns, which has led to a decline in services and population and regional development of our inland centre.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent Australian medical journal stated that the turnover of rural doctors is around 200 per year and each year a similar number is required to fill vacant positions. The 1992 budget established rural incentive programs which were designed to improve rural Australians' access to basic medical services. Funding for this program has been reduced in this budget from an initial $25 million to a paltry $15 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students from country areas continue to suffer educational disadvantage compared with metropolitan students. Financial difficulties have long presented the main barrier to farm students wishing to undertake higher education. Access to higher education was made even more difficult with the imposition of the Austudy assets test in 1989, which excluded many low income families from receiving assistance. While the drought relief payment makes Austudy available for the children of families declared exceptionally drought stricken, rural families suffering from low commodity prices or reduced income from other causes remain unassisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Committee conducted an inquiry into the impact of the assets test on farm families. The committee found that 5,400 students who could qualify for Austudy on the basis of the income test were precluded from accessing it on the basis of the assets test. In other words, 5,400 students who otherwise would have continued their education have had it made very difficult for them to do so. In fact, they are ruled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken no steps to correct this manifestly unfair situation in this year's Austudy budget. It has belatedly acted to close loopholes that were enabling the children of wealthy people on business migration programs and the children of people who were minimising their incomes through complicated company structures to receive Austudy. These tighter targeting measures are expected to save from $13.5 million to around $29 million per year. The government could have channelled these savings into extending Austudy to those 5,400 country children. Its refusal to do so exhibits its complete lack of concern for the future of rural children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget singles out the small business sector to take the brunt of much of its taxation measures. The one sector that has the ability to fire the economy, the one sector that registers employment growth while big business continues to downsize, is the last sector that should be hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boosting of company tax rates from 33c to 36c will impact heavily on the 300,000 small businesses&mdash;around 40 per cent of the small business sector&mdash;that are incorporated. Uncompetitive company tax rates, together with high interest rates and an inflexible industrial relations regime, tend to cause business to flow offshore to countries such as Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, which offer not only overall lower tax regimes but also other benefits, such as tax holidays and investment allowance. The company tax hike will ensure that this damaging trend will continue and that Australian manufacturing industries will continue to move offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong small business sector that pays provisional tax will again be hurt by the government's decision to levy the provisional tax uplift factor at eight per cent, imposing an unfair burden on these businesses. In question time yesterday I asked Senator Cook, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, why the government was imposing the uplift factor at the very high rate of eight per cent, particularly in view of the fact that this rate is double the growth rate and double the headline inflation rate. Senator Cook evaded my question, saying that the government was trying to provide a strong macro-economic outcome, an outcome of sustainable growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not enough. Small business needs taxation relief, labour market deregulation and a competitive interest rate regime. Many small businesses that have survived this government's monetary policies over the past five years are highly geared and this unrealistic uplift factor of eight per cent imposes a considerable strain on cash flow and adds to their debt. The Reserve Bank figures show that the level of small business indebtedness to banks stood at $44 billion as of March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high risk involved in running a small business is reflected in the bankruptcy figures. There were over 14,000 last year and over 70,000 over the past four years. That is absolutely devastating for small business. An uplift factor in line with inflation and growth of around four per cent would have been a far more reasonable impost for small businesses to meet their provisional tax obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax is an area of great contention to the small business community. The government has hugely expanded the scope of this tax since its introduction in 1986, which is reflected in its revenue raising capacity, from an initial $585 million to $3.2 billion last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of Australia as an egalitarian society with a large middle class is increasingly under challenge. The release last month of the Economic Planning and Advisory Commission report on income distribution reveals that the gap between rich and poor has widened significantly over the last few years. The key to economic equality is a job. It is the only way for people to improve their standard of living and that of their family. A job should be every unemployed person's fundamental right, not a privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget penalises business and the productive sector rather than offering them incentive and encouragement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth remembering that a budget is a plan by cabinet, more specifically by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, for this year and for the next four years. The main purpose of the budget is to ensure that the functions of government can be performed effectively and responsibly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In overview, the government has decided to appear to be more fiscally responsible in this budget. It has recognised that its revenue reductions in 1993 were ill advised, and that there was no way the functions required of government could be paid for with the tax base that was left. It raised some new revenue through a number of taxes. It announced that it would finally put the second tranche of cuts out of the way forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes are hardly visible. The second tranche cuts were deferred to `some time in the future' to be brought in by regulation rather than legislation. The super scheme is to be introduced at a four-year budget horizon. It is only in the final year's projection in 1998-99 that the $1 billion tip of the super iceberg becomes visible. We cannot see its real effect on the furthest projections of this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of giving the tax cuts as super payments is problematic. A tax cut increases disposable income. It allows taxpayers to decide how they wish to invest or spend their money. Super contributions, especially those tied to compulsory employee contributions, will decrease disposable income. It will put investment decisions into the hands of super fund managers. People may get a return but only at some distant future date, assuming the world and national economies and Australia's social and political system manage to carry on without major perturbations until then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax is about revenue; superannuation is about retirement income and industrial relations. It is also about savings, investment, speculation and the creation of a huge private industry funded through compulsory payments and taxpayers' dollars. We are being asked to create an alternative private sector pension scheme, a `Medicare Private' model of the age pension through taxes paid to the private sector by employees and employers, and through taxes paid to that sector by government. These taxes will be paid to create a system of taxpayer funded inequality with the better off getting a bigger contribution from government than the lowest paid workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No estimation has been made of the impact on people of the change to their pre-retirement income. No assessment has been made of whether super funds, which will see huge and rapid taxpayer funded growth, will cope, improve fund performance and address the prudential problems. No assessment is made as to what kind of investment we will see and what the impact of creating such huge demand for institutional investment will be. Yet the Treasurer boasts that he will increase super investment tenfold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are general superannuation issues about which I will go into more detail in a separate speech. I notice that all the super schemes will only start to show up at the budget horizon. So even the government's idea that the super scheme will lift our savings statistics and therefore somehow fix our current account balance will not be put to the test for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the economy now? What about our current account balance in the near future? The government is doing nothing. There is no plan here to address the need to become more self-reliant, to move to higher value-added industries to ensure that our domestic economy becomes more diverse, to be more able to meet the needs of ordinary citizens without the need for imports. We see a huge dependence on growth and the assumption that we will keep getting these benefits without any calculation of possible costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see is a great increase in expected revenue. While there are additional revenue measures the increase is mainly through growth, primarily tax on increases in personal income. This, in turn, is predicated on, firstly, the economy growing more rapidly than it has this year; secondly, employment growing as strongly as it has this year; thirdly, average wages rising one per cent faster than they have this year; and, fourthly, the agricultural sector growing, despite uncertain predictions about the end to the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government revenue is very sensitive to small changes in these parameters. If, for example, the only change in government projections is that wages only rise at the same rate as this year, the government will lose $780 million from the predictions. This would wipe out the projected budget surplus and already put the budget into a very small deficit. The basic problem is that revenue from personal income tax is projected to grow at 13.6 per cent when it grew at only 8.8 per cent last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor is outlays. Outlays as a section have increased only slightly. This is mainly because of the offsetting influence of huge asset sales and clawbacks of past loans to the states. These, which are included under outlays in the budget, total over $7 billion, making it possible to increase outlays slightly for normal growth in programs and to make a few new promises without badly impacting on the bottom line figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue here is whether the government can actually get over $5 billion for the assets it is trying to sell. The assets are not individually valued in the budget but media reports suggest that the bulk of the money will be made with the sell-off of the Commonwealth Bank. But government has not been very good at estimating the value of assets or the timing of sale. A case in point, Qantas, is in there again, still waiting to be sold. We were to have seen big sell-offs last year of $2.7 billion but the reality was sales of $55 million. Obviously, reality may wreck any deficit reduction plan for the coming financial year, leaving government with an empty boast of surplus to bring to the next budget. Perhaps sell the same things again!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue of deeper concern is that this year the surplus is to occur through growth and some sleight-of-hand in offsetting within outlays. But the surplus is forecast to rise rapidly in future while asset sales and loan repayments fall off rapidly. The only way that this can occur is through real cuts to program outlays of about 10 per cent of the current budget. With transfers to the states at 12 per cent and defence at eight per cent both locked in and expected to increase, and promises not to reduce pensions or welfare payments, options for cutting such a huge amount from outlays are limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we couple this projection for cuts in programs with the claims by Senator Gareth Evans yesterday over the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Bank, we must agree with Senator Evans that there are now no significant differences between the policy of the government and that of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will these cuts occur? Forward estimates are a measure of intention rather than a reflection of what actually might happen. Many areas which are shown as marked for future decline year after year actually see reasonably stable, sometimes even growing, funding from budget to budget.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This calls into question the value of forward estimates and also the ability of government to make cuts wherever it wishes without facing strong community backlash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our budget pack we asked a few questions. Most relate to equity. Here are some relating to outlays. We asked: are proposed revenue measures progressive in nature? Has expenditure on the welfare sector remained intact or increased? Has funding for health programs been maintained or increased? Has funding for education programs been maintained or increased? Have the higher education contribution scheme, HECS, and fees for additional education services remained at no more than current levels?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also asked: is spending on overseas aid programs greater than the stated goal of 0.36 per cent of Australia's GDP? Is there new and adequate funding for biodiversity programs, marine and coastal initiatives, and restructuring of the forest industry? Have such new programs been funded without compromising existing programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start with the environment. We see on page 3.137 that the environment protection budget is going up by 82 per cent. They say, `Well, that should make the greenies happy.' Maybe not. It seems that 82 per cent is based on a figure of spending of $75 million last year, a bit more than the cost of a single FA18 team. But that figure is a 33 per cent underspend on the amount appropriated. According to Greenpeace, a big part of that underspend was the rehabilitation of Maralinga and a big chunk of the increase this year is simply rolling over that unspent money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go to last year's budget, we see that the increase is actually only 21 per cent or $20 million. It is still a good chunk, but with $18 million of that money for the national forest policy there is not much there for the greenhouse package that was put forward as a major initiative. It should be noted that the greenhouse voluntary agreements with industry will cost $11 million this year. Other specific critiques from the environment movement are that the money supposed to go to the national pollutant inventory has been rolled over twice now in some measure. There is still no sign of any action as a consequence of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem we have is that not only is environmental protection and other environmentally important areas very frequently underspent but also the forward projections in these areas almost always show marked decreases in funding. Is this a sign that government will cut out environmental protection after the budget? Is it a sign that government has some strange notion that the environmental problems of Australia are almost solved and we will do the bulk of that work this year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have problems with toxic algae in many rivers. There is a second instance of major coastal fish deaths this year. Greenhouse will not go away. Rangelands are deteriorating. Political pressure on environmental issues is also not going to disappear&mdash;believe me&mdash;although it is clear that the Prime Minister would like to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional development also has seen the same pattern of underspending and declining forward estimates. The only grey spot in the black vision is the extension of the better cities program, although the concerns about its performance continue. Hopefully, the strong linking with greenhouse issues will result in a more focused performance that flows into other portfolios at all levels of government, but we are not holding our breath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social security has kept fairly constant, although the new deeming laws will hit pensioners with more income reduction based on assumed asset value increases treated under income rather than assets tests. Several areas are declining in real terms, especially in the forward estimates. But social security spending must grow with demand. There is some recognition that the Working Nation parenting allowances will shift demand from assistance to the unemployed to assistance to families, but again in forward estimates it appears that assistance to families, an area about three times the size of unemployment, will not keep up with the demand in real terms. Since there is also the maternity allowance and the shift to social security payments as a way of eliminating tax deductions for children, it is hard to see that this area is funded appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the area of health. Through inadequate funding hospital waiting lists will increase; pharmaceutical bills will be more expensive; there will be a decline in the quality of nursing homes; and the crisis in medical health will expand. The issue of dementia and specialised dementia units is ignored. Integrated community out-of-care support services will be inadequate to meet demands of shorter institutional care and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care has perceptibly declined over the last several years, with increasing pressure on fewer understaffed hospitals. This year the overall budget gets small real increases in dollar funding because of Aboriginal health and a few other programs. But the general health component is not being maintained. The medical benefits budget increases in dollar terms by 3.3 per cent, while inflation is four per cent. This means that there is a decline in real funding for this area which covers much of Medicare. When you factor in an underlying growth of five per cent in demand for services and an average annual increase in fees of four per cent, then the effective reduction in Medicare benefits is in the order of eight to 10 per cent per person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seeks to direct this decline by reducing the number of pathology tests a Medicare recipient is eligible for, a saving of $46 million; by building in downward pressure on total health wages, a saving of $23.3 million; by unspecified running cost savings, a saving of $4.2 million&mdash;that means the hospitals will get blamed for it, not the government&mdash;and by shifting some of the cost for cervical cancer screening to other areas, a saving of $2.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public hospitals are in trouble, with annual budget increases not even keeping up with inflation. When demand and climbing above-inflation costs are included, the level of service will decline markedly. These two areas constitute 62 per cent of the total health budget. Changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are another blow with several drugs being struck off the list and the amount of drugs that an ordinary family buys before moving to the lower rate increasing from $407.60 to $600&mdash;an increase of 150 per cent. This will effectively add $200 to the health bill of families&mdash;all of this when the Medicare levy is going up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the aged: although there is a welcome recognition of the needs of home carers through increases in funding in the home and community care program, there is no measure at all to address the problems of dementia&mdash;a measure that was expected as a result of the Gregory report. The nursing home subsidy has gone up by 0.4 per cent in real terms this year and will probably decline in real dollars on a per person basis. The government will not even keep up with inflation next year and in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we see a real blow to preventive medical treatment. Preventive medicine gets about five per cent of the health budget. There is a modest increase of 14.5 per cent in this area&mdash;health promotion and disease prevention&mdash;although the $36 million, or 24 per cent, underspending last year makes it look much bigger. This was expected, as there are several new programs&mdash;cervical and breast cancer screening and the Burdekin mental health initiatives&mdash;which are to be funded from this program. Women's health, mental health, the national health advancement program and family planning are all located in this area where proper funding can result in a decline in the demand for more expensive acute and chronic treatment. It is therefore of major concern that this area is set to decline in funding by 42 per cent over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In higher education we see a planned decline in real funding of between 1.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent in each forward estimate year. This is at a time when more people are being pushed into further education as an alternative to the dole and tertiary education is seen as necessary to get a reasonable job. The worst aspect of what we see in education, though, is the `hip pocket nationalism' of a government that will sneak in increased fees and cut 50,000 students from Austudy by targeting residents&mdash;people who may have been born here, may have worked years here and paid taxes. This is not about foreign students who already pay 100 per cent of fees up front. It is about people who have been accepted as residents and are treated in all ways, other than voting, as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On foreign aid we have seen a complete abandonment of any pretence of concern. We were supposed to get increased funding last year yet the target, set as a percentage of GDP, was not met. The target has been lowered this year and appears to be lower in the foreseeable future. What we see in this budget is a cleverly packaged election year budget where cuts to services are minimal and disguised. But they are there. An appearance of responsibility is created through high estimates of revenue from growth and through huge assets and clawbacks from state housing and other programs. Beneath the election year budget we see a program to cut public services far more radically. As the icing on the cake, we see the superannuation scheme&mdash;a measure to entrench social inequality in retirement, and to do so at taxpayer expense. We are moving here to establish the foundations of measures which will see the divisions between rich and poor expand until we become two nations within the same borders. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue I want to deal with tonight is how the budget puts pressure on certain families. Having studied the budget and the associated budget papers, I have come to the conclusion that this budget will force more families to have both parents in the paid work force because they will be not be able to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the fine print in the budget we find that it implies that average weekly earnings are expected to fall after inflation and tax. As a result, household incomes will only be sustained if the income earner works longer hours or another member of the family enters the paid work force. This is a consequence of bracket creep tax increases and indirect taxes, not to mention losses in some years of wages diverted to compulsory superannuation levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because more families will have both parents in the paid work force, this will increase pressure on the labour market. The unemployed&mdash;particularly those without skills or experience; they are usually the young&mdash;will face greater difficulties in gaining jobs. In this budget the government has slashed its One Nation commitment to the unemployed by something like $400 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I welcome the reintroduction of the maternity allowance although it amounts to less in terms of average weekly wages than when the maternity allowance was first introduced in 1912 by the Fisher Labor government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the last sitting day in this place for Senator Stephen Loosley, who retires on 19 May after five years in this place. It has been a very distinguished career, not the only highlight of which was being made Mr October in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Men of the Senate</EMPHASIS> calendar for 1993. I think it is important that we mark the occasion by paying appropriate tribute to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me begin with the basics. He was born in Sydney in 1954, which makes him still, of course, a mere slip of a lad. He attended Sydney Technical High School, went on to the University of New South Wales and received first-class honours in political science, with a thesis, inevitably, on Jack Lang&mdash;that figure of endless fascination for the New South Wales Right&mdash;and the Labor governments in New South Wales in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1976 he planned to start a PhD but was persuaded by Graham Richardson to join the newly elected Senator Kerry Sibraa as his research officer&mdash;not, of course, that Kerry ever needed a research officer, but that is the job that Stephen was given. It is reported that he initially said no to Graham Richardson, but he should have known then&mdash;as he undoubtedly does now&mdash;that no-one is ever allowed to say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1977 he was elected to the New South Wales State Labor Council. In 1977-78, he was the national secretary of Young Labor, in 1979 assistant secretary of the New South Wales state branch, replacing Leo McLeay when Mr McLeay came into the House of Representatives on Frank Stewart's death. In 1983 he became general secretary of the New South Wales state branch when Graham Richardson was elected to the Senate. In that capacity, might I say for the record, he was a great organiser and a great campaigner and also showed very considerable, albeit less widely recognised, talent for property management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that, he was senior national vice-president of the ALP. In 1990, he was elected, of course, to the Senate. In the whole period from 1983 to 1991 he was a member of the ALP national executive, for a good proportion of which time he occupied the chair of the foreign affairs, defence and trade policy committee and the international committee of the ALP. His very distinguished career of service within the party structure culminated in his being president of the ALP in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place, in the Senate, Stephen Loosley, unquestionably, has left his mark, and did so in a very short space of time. That mark most notably&mdash;I think most people would again agree; I certainly see it this way&mdash;was in the area of his greatest love, which was foreign affairs. He was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade from when he arrived here in 1990 to 1993, then moved across to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, where he immediately became chairman, and has remained so since May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in this place he has been a supplier of endless series of dorothy dixers of the most helpful kind during my tenure as foreign minister! I do not quite know from where Stephen derived his very obvious flair for current affairs. I have always had one little theory about it. It has been based on one of those `separated at birth' photographs one sees from time to time with prominent look-alikes. It has always seemed to me that if you look very carefully and discount just a little for a certain Caucasian cast you will see that Senator Loosley is a dead ringer for Chinese Premier Li Peng. That is a personal perception I have had which he regards as very quirky. Hitherto, that has not been in the public domain, but there it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As chairman of the joint committee, Stephen was personally associated with the production of a number of quite excellent reports of that committee. He was also a first-class host to many prominent and high level visitors to this country. It is not always, might I say with the utmost respect to my parliamentary colleagues, that one can with total confidence send a high level visitor off to the chairman of a parliamentary committee with the knowledge that that visitor will be in for a stimulating and informative encounter, but that was invariably the case with Stephen. That is a great asset to have around the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think beyond all of that it was Stephen Loosley's very capable and sensitive leadership of several very important parliamentary delegations that was the role in which he made probably his most significant and positive contribution of all, in relation to some very intractable problems on the foreign policy agenda. I have in mind particularly his leadership last year of the delegation to Papua New Guinea and Bougainville. It was an initiative that unquestionably led very directly to the peace talks which then occurred between the Papua New Guinea government and the Bougainville separatists, and has created the environment for the uncertain but nonetheless quietly progressive movement towards the restoration of peace in that unhappy province. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then again, most recently there was his leadership just a month or so ago of the path breaking&mdash;and it was path breaking&mdash;delegation to Vietnam. Whether or not Senator Short concedes that status, I think the trip by that delegation and the report which was tabled in this place just yesterday have helped Australia and the government of Vietnam come to grips more comprehensively with each other and helped, in particular, the Vietnamese to come a little more squarely to terms with human rights issues in a constructive and forward looking way. I warmly congratulate him and the other members of that delegation, but particularly Stephen, for his leadership of that very sensitive, very delicate, very difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alexander Downer, about whom I was discussing a variety of matters in the last day or so, was very quick to tell me how much he appreciated Stephen's leadership, which introduced a note of immediate caution on my part as to just what he had actually been up to. But there it is. You do get that bipartisanship endorsement which good leaders in the foreign policy area particularly and indeed other public policy areas in this place can invariably attract. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like yourself.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Panizza. That is very gracious of you. Senator Loosley has also participated in many other important delegations, including twice to the former Soviet Union at a time when it was transforming into the post-Cold War state that we are now becoming more familiar with. He has been a regular visitor to the United States over the years in an emerging tradition, not entirely confined to the New South Wales Right, of close association with a knowledge of the United States political system and he has been one of the great communicators about the American political system on the Australian scene.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally his travel in the five years of his time in the Senate has been almost as extensive, I think, as my own. Indeed, I have often sensed his breath at the back of my neck as I have modestly gone about my business around the world. But one further thing should be said about Stephen Loosley's foreign affairs role. It was always the case that he never saw his role as being only to deal with what purportedly counts as the more glamorous side of the foreign affairs business, to the extent that there is one. Quietly, sympathetically and effectively he has helped many Australians affected by the good and the bad side of international events. I know, to take just one example, how much he has personally tried to assist the family of the young Australian David Linder, who disappeared in what are unhappily seen to be tragic circumstances while travelling in Iran some 18 months ago. Stephen's remarkable diversity of talents, I think, is shown by the fact that he was simultaneously patron of the Australian Defence Association and chair of the parliamentary Human Rights Subcommittee, proving once and for all, irrevocably, in a way that made the point beyond argument, that these two activities need not be contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Stephen and I have been good friends personally over the years, especially since his entry into this parliament. We combined most memorably for several years on the tennis court in Senate versus House of Representatives matches until it got to the point where I got puffed walking onto the court and had to retire gracefully. It was the only time I can ever remember barracking for the Senate against the House of Representatives in my 17 years here. But it was a fine partnership, Stephen, while it lasted and we did actually win a match or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully expect that Stephen Loosley will continue to make a very fine contribution to this country and to the evolution of good public policy in this country in whatever role he chooses to play. For the moment he has chosen now to follow a quite different career path in law, for which he has been very successfully preparing himself through part-time study in the last few years. He has explained the reasons why he is leaving at this time in what he said to the Senate in announcing his departure a few weeks ago. I can certainly sympathise with him in his desire, which he will now be able to fully realise, to spend more time with Lynne, and with Nicholas and James, his two young children, and to have a generally more rational and sane and balanced lifestyle than is possible for any of us in this place. Certainly I know I speak for everyone in the Labor Party and in the wider labour movement and I believe I speak for everyone in this chamber when I wish Stephen Loosley all the very best for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I rise for myself and for those of my colleagues who will not be speaking to acknowledge Stephen Loosley's contribution to this parliament and to this Senate and to wish him well for the future. Not all of my colleagues will speak because there is no hypocrisy on this side of the chamber, Stephen, but there is a lot of goodwill towards you and we would not want you to be leaving without being aware of that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess part of that goodwill relates to the fact that you are so party political. Some of us believe not only in being political but also in being party political. The strength of our democracy very much reflects the strength and good heart of the major parties in this country. I am reminded of your party background and your commitment to the ALP; that is something we recognise also. Such a commitment is not often well understood within the community and the part that that plays in our public life is not always well understood or fully appreciated in all its consequences. But we understand what it means and recognise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously I also wanted to speak because I appreciate the contribution that you have made to Australian foreign policy&mdash;I think I could probably say&mdash;certainly to the practice of it and to the support you have given Senator Gareth Evans in the role that you have played in Senate committees and then as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, a committee on which I served for many years. I know that you have been held in high regard on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of the work that you have performed on many of the delegations to which Senator Evans referred. Some of them I regard as vitally important. I am as interested in the future of Bougainville as anyone in this place, having been there also in difficult times&mdash;perhaps not with the same support mechanisms that you might have received, but in opposition you have to battle along notwithstanding. I recognise and appreciate that work. I appreciate the commitment you have made to enhancing Australia's bilateral relationships and, in particular, your belief in human rights&mdash;not simply believing them but getting out and working to maintain and to enhance them. I wanted to put that appreciation on the record as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, as I have said to you personally, Stephen, I am disappointed you are leaving at least parliamentary life at this time. I hope you are not leaving public life, as such. I suspect you will not. But it is a little disappointing when somebody such as yourself comes in so well qualified and stays for such a relatively short time. We were confident, now that you have completed your apprenticeship, that you would be on the front bench of the next opposition and would have made a very useful contribution in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We listened to you when you explained why you were leaving. It does cause us some concern that pressures on family life that seem to be part and parcel of this business can take such a consequence&mdash;and, in some ways, an unfortunate consequence. Perhaps it suggests that we all should look for ways in which we can try to make this life perhaps a little more civilised and a little easier on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen, you have chosen, however, a different path and I think you will find it interesting. Some of us who came from that path before we came here found the law fascinating in the same way that politics is fascinating. I know that you will enjoy it and find it challenging. I wish you well in that regard. As I hinted a moment ago, I am confident that you will remain in public life in various ways and I certainly encourage you to do so. On behalf of those of my colleagues who will not be speaking, I thank you for your contribution to this parliament and to the Senate and wish you all the best for the future.</PARA>

But I do feel that, with the combination of the Westminster system and the United States system that we have here, that is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it has been very interesting to sit back and have a look at the terms of various MPIs that have been produced from time to time, particularly by the opposition. It is very interesting to see that the more pejorative the terms of those MPIs, the more likely you are to have Stephen Loosley fronting up to defend the government. It is very interesting indeed to see who the government wheels in when it is under a bit of attack and who the government wheels in when there are problems about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is somebody sitting rather close to you, Senator Loosley, who is also wheeled in on difficult occasions&mdash;that is, of course, Senator Barney Cooney. It is quite noticeable when the government is in trouble as to who is wheeled in. Senator Loosley is going; I do not know what Senator Cooney has in mind or who they will wheel in next. But I must say that, whenever Senator Loosley was so wheeled in, he made a jolly good fist of it and defended what was indefensible on many occasions&mdash;and did so very vigorously indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear what Senator Gareth Evans said.

I had not actually seen any part of the process but he soon revealed that he knew what the arrangements were, who to go to, where the toilets were and generally what the place was all about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years as a senator is a very short time. I looked at the statistics to see how many people have left the Senate since Stephen and I entered it in 1990. Senator Loosley, you will be interested to know that since that time some 10 senators have resigned in mid-term and a further 10 or so senators have also left at the end of their careers or as a result of the ballot box. You, Senator Loosley, are different from them all, actually, because you are in fact comparatively young.

In fact that, given the modern Labor Party, may be more typical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley, you have, as many of my colleagues have said, made a contribution in this chamber. I will not go through the list that others have given, but certainly in the area of foreign affairs I think your contribution is very widely recognised indeed. I certainly appreciated in the last major report you brought down that, almost alone of your colleagues, you showed some interest in the area which is now occupying quite a bit of the time of Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Lavarch; that is, the role of international treaties and our legal and constitutional system. While I was hopeful that the report would go further than it ultimately did, I think the recognition you gave in the report that this was an important issue and that it was time the parliament addressed its mind to it certainly helped push that debate a little further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are a child of the New South Wales Labor Right, but I have always thought you were slightly different from the other members of the New South Wales Right that I had met over the years. I have always felt that they had a 100 per cent, winner-take-all approach to politics. You seem to have a 95 per cent approach. That at least, I suspect, has encouraged you to establish perhaps wider links than many of your colleagues have done in their time in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell quoted a story about Senator Loosley walking down the beaches in Rio. To show the range of contacts you have, I was astonished to find on going to the wedding of two well-known Liberals recently that I had to share the platform with you, Stephen. That came as a surprise to a few people, I have to say, but I think it showed, among other things, the very wide range of contacts that you have been able to establish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised to hear how often Stephen has been on these overseas trips. Taken with his part-time study, I have wondered how much time he was able to devote to chamber work. The record shows that he has been a very active participant in this chamber. I have always found his speeches worth listening to. I have often come into the chamber to try to cause him some problems and harass him, often with very limited success. The points that Senator Harradine made were very well taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an early end to a political career. It probably makes us all reflect a little on our own circumstances. But most will want to plough on and achieve the glittering prizes that we all seek. Stephen has a wide range of interests. I know that he is a great movie buff. I know that he has a great love of history. Above all, I know in my many conversations with him that he has a great love for his family. This is why he has decided to leave this chamber. So I join with my other colleagues and wish Stephen and his wife Lynne and sons Nicholas and James all the very best for the future. </PARA>

For as long as I can recall in the 20 years that I have known him, Stephen has been a participator and a player in the foreign affairs debate.

Stephen has to a fair degree led this chamber and perhaps the parliament of this country in addressing those issues. Many people in those countries will in years to come be able to say, `This report and visit by this committee and these people has had a significant effect upon our country.' Stephen will be able to take some pride in that. In his future career, he will be able to observe what happens in those places. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to agree with Senator Harradine's remarks about those committees, that sometimes terribly interesting questions are asked and even when we, as senators and members, ask questions and are squirming in our seats and really want to jump up and run away Senator Loosley would go calmly on with the meeting. Witnesses were always treated with great respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone got a fair go&mdash;everyone. Sometimes I did not think that was a reasonable thing but everyone got a fair go to ask questions, and the session&mdash;and this is the real key&mdash;always finished exactly on time, if not a bit before. I have never known a chairman who can do that and whatever that secret is, Stephen, I would really like to know. It is something that we ought to spread around here. It is a great skill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the first delegation that Stephen led that I was on was to Bougainville. It was a difficult delegation. At times we thought we were being shot at. It was very hot, very humid. It was a war zone, so it was very difficult. At all times he was a polished and skilful leader. When we were questioning members of the PNG defence force in Arawa, when we were talking with Bougainvillean church and women's groups in Buka or when we were in very formal meetings with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Stephen was always exactly what Australians would want as a leader of such a delegation. I congratulate him for that. I was proud to be on that delegation with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one point, right at the very beginning, we were on Buka and we had had a very long and difficult meeting that had taken five or six hours in very difficult conditions and we had just gone to visit the hospital, which I do not recommend to anybody. It is in a disgraceful condition. Anyway, we were coming back from there and the ABC cameraman came up alongside me and said, `The Bougainvillean women are talking about you, you know.' I, like any normal person, assumed that they were talking about the hideous state my hair was in because I had pulled it back to get it off my face it was so hot. But, no, that was not what they were talking about at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said they were talking about the way the delegation actually seemed to want to make a difference, the way we had stuck it out for five hours in that really dreadful meeting and then gone straight from there, even though it was dusk and we were told we really should not go, over to see the hospital before we went back and had our evening meal. They were very impressed. He said that they had been very impressed with the way Senator Loosley had led that first discussion. I thought that was really quite special. It was his first big discussion on a very difficult human rights delegation. To get that sort of feedback from the people we were talking to was very impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an example of Stephen's generosity in that trip too. Overnight, the temperature in Buka went down to about 35 degrees celsius, and the humidity went down to about 99 per cent. For the first night, Stephen had an airconditioned room and the rest of us had not. Margaret Swieringa and I shared a room next door to Stephen, and at breakfast the next morning he said, `You really do not look very well.' We said, `That's because we did not sleep at all. We did not sleep for one minute last night.' He insisted that we take the airconditioned room the next night. I do not believe for a minute that he slept at all during the next night, but I will be forever grateful because I did. I slept for a good eight hours, and it was wonderful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The trip to Vietnam was more difficult than Bougainville. We never at any point thought anyone was shooting at us, but our hosts were not really keen to see us come and they were not really keen to see us go through it. We had expected, especially before we left, that it would be a very difficult mission. It was made far easier because Stephen was such a good chair. He led that very well, and we came out of it with a very good report&mdash;one that I am proud of and one that I have heard a lot of good reports of. I think that was another real high point in Stephen's career until now. I wish him and Lynne well for the future, particularly in a new and spectacular career. I expect it to be spectacular, and I look forward to watching it.

I cannot recall precisely which year it was. I have been endeavouring to remember that far back. I do recall that I received a phone call from Graham Richardson. One thing you do not forget is receiving phone calls from Graham Richardson or from any other general secretary of the New South Wales ALP. They are usually about important matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, I was a delegate from the Sutherland shire area in Sydney to what was called the regional assembly. It was an assembly of members of the party which covered the St George and Sutherland shire areas. Graham was a bit concerned at the time that the Left were pretty active in the area under the leadership of a former senator and that they might get control of the regional assembly that was to be held in a few weekends time. He said to me, `I want you to go to one of the planning meetings for this regional assembly. There will be a young bloke there called Stephen Loosley. You should say hello to him, because this guy is going to go places.' Graham gave Steve a very big wrap. He particularly pointed out to me that he is an ex-Leftie but said, `We have him now and he will certainly be one of our stars of the future.' Graham's predictions came true, as invariably in those days and for a long time thereafter they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve demonstrated at that meeting I went to when I first met him what a first-class political tactician he was. He developed a strategy that if we could actually convince enough people not to turn up to the regional assembly there would not be a quorum and the Left would not get control. Eventually, down the track we did actually abolish the damn thing. That all happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On numerous occasions thereafter, in his various capacities in the party administration, Steve demonstrated not only what a first-class political tactician he was, what a first-class campaign director he was, but also what a first-class policy analyst he was&mdash;something not often found in those who are involved purely in political administration. Steve went on to become an official of the New South Wales branch of the ALP. He rose through the ranks to become general secretary in 1983 and served in that position until 1990 when he entered the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already said that Steve showed what an astute political mind he had when he joined the New South Wales Right after having a brief flirtation with the Left. It is customary in this place, in the press&mdash;just about everywhere&mdash;and even in the Labor Party at times, for people to denigrate the New South Wales Right. Many times we have been abused and pilloried. Our leaders have been defamed and demonised and, of course, Steve Loosley has had to cop his fair share of that. But all of that criticism&mdash;a totally unfounded attack as it was&mdash;is motivated by jealousy of the phenomenal political success of the New South Wales Right and therefore, as a consequence, the political success of the New South Wales ALP. Certainly, under the stewardship of Stephen's predecessor as general secretary, Graham Richardson, and under his own stewardship in those years between 1983 and 1990&mdash;when he left to go into parliament and handed over to John Della Bosca&mdash;that political success has continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Throughout the last 20 years, the New South Wales branch of the ALP has been at the forefront of the electoral success of the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments in the federal sphere and the Wran and Carr governments at the state level in New South Wales. Administering a political party is not an easy task. It is particularly difficult in the Australian Labor Party. It is even more difficult in the New South Wales branch because of the broad range of interests, both political and industrial, of Left, Right, Centre and occasionally Other&mdash;never the Centre Left. But we have managed to ensure that it has only ever made a small intrusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is a difficult, thankless task to be the chief administrator of the branch in New South Wales. When you win everyone wants to claim the victory. When you lose&mdash;fortunately, only infrequently has that occurred in New South Wales over the period&mdash;you find yourself bearing the blame almost alone. Steve Loosley in his period with the New South Wales party can rightly take great credit for the electoral success of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales and, indeed, the nation during those many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I said, people unjustly attack the New South Wales Right because in Steve's own personal qualities he puts the lie to all of those attacks made upon the New South Wales Right and its leadership. Over the many years that I have known Steve and counted him as a good friend, I have always found him to be&mdash;as other people here tonight have said&mdash;considerate, polite, articulate, fair and patient; indeed, a good, decent, respectable mate. Steve has carried on that commitment and those characteristics during his time in this parliament. Others have already spoken about his work in the parliament and in the government, particularly in the areas of foreign affairs and his commitment to human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with some degree of irony that I actually rise tonight to speak on what is Stephen Loosley's last day in this parliament, because it was exactly 12 months ago today that I was sworn in as a senator for New South Wales and I was escorted to the table by Senator Loosley and Senator Gareth Evans to take the oath. During that 12 months, Steve has always been ready to offer me as a new senator advice, encouragement and assistance whenever I have sought that from  him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve has indicated that he leaves the parliament and the government to take up a career in the law. Someone, I think, earlier noted that this is a rather strange twist because people usually leave the law to take up politics. As we all know, Steve has a deep interest in&mdash;indeed, a passion for&mdash;politics, particularly political biography, political history and an unparalleled knowledge of American political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure everyone has seen him at some time or other with a book under his arm and no doubt we have all shared the anecdotes that he can relate about the great and not so great figures of American and Australian political history. I am sure that Steve has already heard this little story, but I think it is appropriate to recall tonight what a great American figure of political history, Adlai Stevenson, once said. It was shortly after the election of John F. Kennedy to the Presidency of the United States when John Kennedy commenced putting his administration together and he recruited many legal practitioners from Adlai Stevenson's law firm to serve in his administration. Eventually, Adlai Stevenson became so frustrated at losing all of his legal talent that he remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret that I have but one law firm to give to my country. </PARA>
<PARA>Today the country returns the favour somewhat with Steve leaving the political arena and entering into the law. But, Steve, I do issue a warning. As you no doubt are aware, lawyers, like politicians, are not very popular. Indeed, we rate fairly low in the popularity polls. And I know that&mdash;like many in this building&mdash;I happen to be both!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot claim anywhere near your expertise in political history. But I have had a longstanding interest in literature, particularly the great American writer and satirist Mark Twain. Mark Twain did not much like lawyers. He and his fictional characters demonstrated the public's general distrust of those who exercise power and authority. But he did it with humour&mdash;a quality that I know you possess in great measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one occasion after delivering a very humorous address to a New England society banquet, Mark Twain sat down and the host, a leading attorney of the area, stood up with his hands in his pockets and said:</PARA>

<PARA>To which Mark Twain then rose to his feet and replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does it not also appear strange to this assembly that a lawyer should have his hands in his own pockets?</PARA>
<PARA>One further thing that I was reminded of occurred when listening to Senator Bell talking about dress sense. One of my early recollections of Stephen Loosley at state conferences occurred on one of those long weekends in June. There were two people who wore double-breasted suits&mdash;only two of them, I think. One of them was the late Rex Connor and the other one was the young Stephen Loosley. As was stated on one occasion, when Stephen Loosley strode to the microphone he looked like a spinnaker under full sail. He certainly made an impression whenever he strode to the microphone in both what he wore and what he said. </PARA>

We often had very contradictory views. Steve would always come up with a sensible compromise&mdash;whether it was either delaying or adjourning the meeting or trying to come up with a set of words or a couple of different reports. More out of a sense of wanting to write another article for a newspaper or something&mdash;or a sense of `let's get this bloody meeting finished with'&mdash;he always solved the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine made an important remark in relation to the talent that Steve obviously possesses as a debater, as someone with a good grasp of policy and as someone who could defend the indefensible for the Labor government. In virtually all of the urgency motions and the MPIs that I have seen take place in this building during the past five years, Senator Loosley has bowled up as one of the government's speakers&mdash;a very effective speaker at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will talk about Senator Cooney when it is his valedictory&mdash;which I hope is not for a long time, Senator Cooney. As I was saying, that is a mark of the man. I was very surprised that Steve was not made a minister after the surprise win in the 1993 election. As other speakers on this side have said&mdash;from memory, they were Senator Hill and Senator Kemp&mdash;there is no doubt from our side in looking across at the government benches that Senator Loosley, no matter what happened after the next election, would have been on the front bench. Clearly, Steve has thought about that in making this decision which will affect the rest of his life. As Senator Hill said, he probably thought that six or nine years on the opposition front bench would not be that much fun so he has gone to the law instead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either way, Stephen Loosley has been a great success in national politics. In a period of five years he has achieved an enormous amount not only as a government member&mdash;albeit not on the front bench&mdash;as a very successful chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, as someone who has come into this place with the reputation of being a hard and successful party political operative but also as someone who has shown his policy credentials, his debating credentials and communication credentials, which are all facets of a well-rounded and successful politician. Steve has shown he is better than most in all of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve and I also share an interest in US politics, although I would never pretend to know as much about it as he does. It is something in which I have had a close interest since the Watergate years, when I used to sit around and read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazines. It was interesting to watch the ABC series about it. Watching that series, Watergate seemed like a hell of a long time ago now, but it seems like only yesterday that we were reading about it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell one anecdote about Senator Loosley to show how he can get things done around this place. For a number of months leading up to the November congressional elections I was contemplating how we could receive the CNN broadcast in this building. Most people thought it would be a good service to have although, as it happened, some of us were not that keen on the election result. I was contemplating writing a letter to the President or the Speaker to get that organised. It got to within about a day of the November election and I thought that the quickest way to do it would be to speak to Steve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We bumped into each other in the corridor and I said, `Steve, can we get CNN organised?' The next day it was all fixed. The trouble is that they have forgotten to turn it off. I think that Steve and I between us ensured that everyone in this building was able to witness one of the greatest events in modern history&mdash;an absolute landslide election in the US Congress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve is going to a career in the law. As other people have said, he will be a loss to this place. We know it takes sacrifice and a special sort of person to pursue a career in politics. It is very sad to see someone who, as Senator Hill said, has served an apprenticeship leave so prematurely. There are enormous pressures here, and other people have referred to that, but there are special pressures on those of us who enter politics at a younger age. It is a great loss to Australian political life that someone with Steve's undoubted capacity should decide that the private sector offers more. Steve had so much to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have spoken about Steve moving to the law and having a successful career. I was looking across at his leader, Senator Gareth Evans, when he said that if Senator Loosley fulfils in law the potential he has shown in politics, it may not be too many years before he appears before Justice Evans in the High Court. I look forward to seeing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying one or two things about the importance of political organisation. The work done by the so-called numbers men, the behind-the-scenes operators, is rarely spoken about. It is about manoeuvring political parties. It is about factional organisation. It is about organising volunteers to build a political party through recruitment of members and organisation of election campaigns. It is about keeping the party organisation together between campaigns and ensuring that the party attracts the sort of people who can go on to serve in parliament. It is sometimes referred to in valedictory speeches. It is sometimes analysed by journalists who do not understand what is involved. It is a very important part of the political life of any nation and, as Senator Forshaw said, it is hard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed by a speech made by the now Speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States, Newt Gingrich, when he was talking about this to his political organisation, which is called GOPAC, in the United States. He was encouraging volunteers by saying that you do not need to ask the questions, `Is it hard to run a nation? Is it hard to change a democracy like America'&mdash;and I think you can apply this to Australia&mdash;`Is it hard to create a political organisation? Is it hard to gather the ideas, the volunteers, the money and the skills required to communicate those ideas to the people?' because it is all very hard. It is important work. It is not recognised broadly in the community. It is very hard to build that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether people over here like it or not, there is no doubt that the New South Wales Labor Party&mdash;and many of the people who sit opposite us, Senator Loosley in particular&mdash;has been very successful at that very hard work of political organisation. It is something that people very rarely get any sort of recognition for, except for having a few glasses of champagne or a few cold tinnies on election night and for that thrill, that feeling, that very few of us over here have enjoyed for many years except in recent state elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve, you have been an enormous success. It is an enormously premature decision for you to leave. It is a victory for the coalition that you are leaving because the Labor Party in the Senate is losing one of its most effective people, and one of the people who was marked for great things in the future no matter what happens at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I envy you to the extent that you will be able to spend a lot more time with Lynne, Nicholas and James. They will be the winners as well. The Labor Party will be the loser. I wish you genuinely very well for your future career.

You have a lot to offer this country. On behalf of my family to your family, you have my genuine wishes for your future life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not able to be here for the opening remarks of the leaders of the various parties on the occasion of Stephen Loosley leaving the Senate. I want to say a few words and be brief, but this in no way reflects my view about Stephen's contribution to both the Labor Party and the Australian parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like Stephen and a range of people who sit on this side, came into the Senate from being a full-time party official of the Labor Party at some stage or other. There are a number of us here who belong to the ex-secretary's or ex-assistant secretary's club. At times I think we are the biggest faction in the Labor Party in the Senate. I have known Stephen since the mid-1970s when he was the assistant secretary of the Labor Party of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay particular tribute to an aspect of Stephen's work in the Labor Party before he came to the Senate. Stephen was one of those people who, as assistant secretary but particularly as state secretary or general secretary in New South Wales and then a senior official of the national executive, had a view about the need to modernise the organisation of the Australian Labor Party to make it contemporary with the needs and wishes of Australia in the latter part of the 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen always put his hand up for change, to reform the organisation of the Labor Party so it would have a national outlook, a national perspective. I believe the Labor Party has won five elections in a row&mdash;unparalleled success in our history of over 100 years at the federal level&mdash;because during the 1980s a number of people of the national executive at a national conference voted to make fundamental changes to the way the Labor Party operated so it could become a truly national organisation. In every one of those debates&mdash;whether they were at the national executive, the national conference or back at the state party level&mdash;Stephen was always supportive of those moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen, whatever else you may achieve in the rest of your life, as a person who is interested in history you have the great record and proud achievement of turning the Labor Party into a proper national party which has borne great benefits not just for the Labor Party but for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been intrigued by the fact, to which others have paid tribute, that Stephen is an enormous historian in his own right.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he played a major part during the 1980s in convincing the Labor Party to be proud of its history, to research it, to promote it, to have Labor historian conferences and so on. It has been a great achievement for the party that we realise that, whatever our failures and our successes in the past, it is all part of the great historical tapestry of the Labor Party which has meant that the culture of the Labor Party of which we are members has an enduring history. The people who have gone before us are to be respected and remembered, as are those who will go on in the future. Stephen was one of the leaders in that regard in the Labor Party. That is another major achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not comment about Stephen's success as a factional leader of the New South Wales Right. I am in another faction and from another state. But it was often put that when we both served on the national executive, on a number of occasions he would move a motion and I would second it, or vice versa, to intervene, under the new national approach of the Australian Labor Party, in recalcitrant state branches which seemed not to be able to resolve their own problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Stephen and I have moved more motions to intervene in the 1980s in the ACT branch than we have had good or bad dinners. Although it made us unpopular in the ACT branch, in the long run it was to the advantage of the ACT branch. I think all other branches, including my own, who had resolutions of intervention ultimately moved against them will know it has made the Labor Party a better organisation. So Stephen Loosley's contribution to the success of the Labor Party is very, very significant and I pay tribute to him. As he comes from the largest state it would always have been easy to ignore the interests of the smaller states but Stephen did not. He always argued for a national approach. What was of interest in other states was of interest to Stephen Loosley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since being elected to the Senate his interest in foreign affairs in particular has always been noted. He was chairman of the party's foreign affairs committee before he came here. His commitment to the campaign to abolish apartheid in South Africa was second to none. He was always the one moving those motions at the party conference, or at the national executive. He also put his hand up for his own state branch to put money into the cause of getting rid of apartheid in South Africa&mdash;money that people sometimes said should have been spent at home on winning a local election campaign. Stephen always had the broader view that there are issues in the world that one cannot walk away from. I know that the ANC in particular recognises Stephen's contribution to their campaign and the ultimate success which we now all rejoice in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former chairman and member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I acknowledge Stephen's contribution over the last 2 1/2 years since he became chairman. I am very pleased in particular that the work he has done on human rights in that committee continued to establish a benchmark for the parliament and for Australia on the issue of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, being an agnostic in the sense of being without fear or favour, he has criticised those regimes around the world on the Left and the Right which have abused human rights. Stephen has always been there to put his hand up to make the criticism. His work on the recent report on human rights came through, as Senator Vicki Bourne outlined, in the visit to Bougainville and the recent visit to Vietnam. Although it has only been a short time since he became chairman of the committee, Stephen has left his mark there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may think it is very strange that, after only five years in the Senate, Stephen has chosen to take up a position in the law. I think it is very strange, and most people know my views about the legal profession. But what people forget is that Stephen has not been in politics for just five years; he has been at it for over 20 years in a full-time capacity in one way or another. To be in full-time politics for 20 years&mdash;whether it be in parliament or in the party organisation&mdash;is a long time. We on all sides of politics should always remember, as Senator Campbell said, that the work in the organisation in respect of the political structure and the functioning of a democracy is as important as that in the parliament itself. As a former state secretary I would have to say that it is much easier being a senator than the secretary of a state branch of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Stephen had been in the Senate for about three weeks&mdash;I had already had one term here&mdash;he came up to me in the corridor just outside the chamber and said, `Gee, this is an easy job compared with being a state secretary.' I said, `Stephen, you're dead right.' Fred Daly may well have said this: the Senate proves that there is life after death. The party may have pensioned off many of us party secretaries or assistant secretaries to this place, but it is a useful apprenticeship to have been through the party machine&mdash;whether it be that of the Labor, Liberal or National parties or the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen has done his apprenticeship. He served in public life for over 20 years in one form or another. Stephen, I wish you and your family well. You have made a great contribution to both the Labor Party and the parliament of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to Stephen who is a very tough opponent and a very committed fighter for the principles that he believes in, some of which I share, including commitment to the labour movement and the creation of a society based on a redistribution of wealth and power. We have different views about what that means. That is the nature of the struggle within the labour movement. Senator Loosley shares with many on the left a commitment to human rights and international social justice. I think the breadth of that commitment is surprising. Perhaps it indicates that some of the good things he learnt while he was a member of the Left have not been lost entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you come into the Senate, you come with certain perceptions; certain prejudices, I suppose; and certain reputations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have told me how surprised they were at how well Senator Loosley and I got on during those battles and how effectively we were able to work together. One of the great  strengths of the Labor Party is that people with different traditions and different views of the way we should go forward are able to come together in respect of the struggle that is so important to this country.

That is what Senator Loosley was able to bring here. Before he was able to open his mouth in this chamber he had effectively served 20 years in an apprenticeship. It needs to be understood that, when we come into this place, we quite often come in here as seasoned veterans in the struggle, and  Senator Loosley's contribution to his country goes way beyond the five years that he has spent in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tribute ought to be paid to his toughness and his commitment to the battle.

I have been put on the odd committee under adverse circumstances and I could look to Senator Loosley and know that he was someone in whom I could have some confidence. He was not going to walk away from a fight. He is a very good person to have with you in your particular corner. </PARA>

The reality, of course, is that, particularly in the Senate committee system&mdash;which you, Senator Loosley, have graced&mdash;the amount of consensus, the amount of searching for accommodations and the effort to try to achieve a reasonable solution that will be in the best interests of the people of Australia does exercise the great bulk of our time.

I think some senators on the other side, and on this side, have already said that we expected that, with the sort of talent you showed, one day you would be on the frontbench&mdash;and that it would not be too long before you would be a member of the cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen, when you made your statement to the Senate about your decision to leave the place you said that you wanted to spend more time with your family.

I hope that decision brings joy to you and to your family in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening with interest to the comments Senate colleagues have been making about my friend Stephen Loosley and I do not wish to duplicate them. Enough has been said, very important and serious things. I do not know when I first met Steve Loosley&mdash;it seems like I have known him forever&mdash;but we have worked very closely together as officials in the party, senators and friends. I want to comment on three aspects of his activity which are not directly related to any of those activities but which I think are important parts of what has made Steve such a good contributor to the political process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Jones has said, he is more than just an efficient political operator, which he certainly was, sometimes on my side and sometimes not and unfortunately equally efficient on both sides. I only 50 per cent appreciated the bit when it was on my side. But there are other things that made him a more interesting and substantial contributor. The first of the three things I want to emphasise is his profound interest in history&mdash;Australian history, world history, and particularly his expertise in some areas of American history. It gave him a depth on which he could draw in his analysis of contemporary circumstances. Obviously much of it was about political history. That was what one heard drawn upon most often in political discussions, but he had a breadth of interest in history, which is something we should all pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there was his role as an internationalist. That had a very important influence in the Labor Party in the development of some of the links in this region and in the wider international community that has made the party, and subsequently the government on which it is based, a broader and more effective institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is his love and knowledge of the film industry. I was always overwhelmed by the fact that, compared to most other people around the Senate and around the Labor Party I knew a lot about the film industry and had an interest, but compared to Steve I always found I knew nothing. It is not just an interest and a passion but a very deep intellectual commitment to it and study of it. I am sure the movie theatres are going to get quite a bashing now he has more time to attend to them. I hope that he takes advantage of the opportunity and that it adds another perspective to public life, as I am sure it will to private life. I find that a commitment to any area of the arts gives one a capacity to make more interesting and effective and original contributions throughout other areas of public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of things I could say about Steve in the Labor Party but they have been said by Senator Schacht and others and I will not duplicate them. I merely endorse them. I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with him in many forums but those three aspects were, I thought, unique contributions that he made over and above those effective organisational contributions for which the more orthodox recollections will always record his significant contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a few comments I would like to make to farewell Stephen Loosley. I had the pleasure, too, of being with Senator Bell on a trip to Argentina. The thing that I learnt about Senator Loosley then&mdash;which I do not think has been referred to here tonight&mdash;is that he is one of the few people I know who can recite word for word every chapter and verse of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Adventures of Barry Mackenzie</EMPHASIS>. I know he is a scholar. He knows his history. He is erudite and wonderful. In any doubtful moment, another passage of what Barry was up to flowed from the lips of Senator Loosley and indeed, I have to say, from the lips of Mr Paul Filing from the other place. Senator Loosley was a most entertaining addition to the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is quite right. I thought an odd note of reality and a different sense of humour might be intruded here. Another thing about Stephen Loosley is that he has a splendid sense of humour. It is a very informed and intelligent sense of humour, but it is a splendid sense of humour. It is one of the factors that have helped rescue a number of difficult situations and indeed probably adds to the qualities others have mentioned of Stephen's capacity to be such a good chair or manager of any kind of organisation. His capacity to do that is splendid. He has also been very willing and very able to offer any support or advice to me and to others who sought it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of committees, I will never forget listening to an exchange between Senator Loosley and Mr Pooley from the Treasury when Mr Pooley was even more than usually disinclined to pass on any information at all to honourable senators. Stephen bowled every ball that is in Shane Warne's armoury. He tried a few curve balls, a few medium pacers and a couple of fast balls. Absolutely nothing stirred Mr Pooley from his considered and reasonable approach: `That is what I want to say and I am not saying any more.' I was enormously entertained then, Stephen. I am not sure I should say that entertainment is the only way I will remember you, but it is certainly one way. I will remember you with great fondness and I wish you every success in wherever your future takes you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, I begin my final contribution in the Australian Senate by congratulating you publicly, as I have done privately, on your election. It is thoroughly well deserved and you will make a great contribution to the Australian Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To paraphrase Robert Penn Warren: there is an end but you will not see it; there is a beginning but you cannot see it. Perhaps tonight the great author was wrong in the sense that this is the finish of my involvement in the Senate and shortly there will be a beginning in another career&mdash;in law. It is something that causes me a degree of sadness, but it is something that also brings to me a sense of optimism about the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a privilege to have served in this chamber over the last five years. It is a very great privilege afforded to very few Australians. I want to acknowledge that now at the beginning of my speech. I thank my personal staff over the years, the staff of the parliament and my colleagues and friends. I am absolutely overwhelmed by the generosity of spirit demonstrated by people around the chamber&mdash;from within my own party, the coalition, the Democrats and Senator Harradine. It has been extraordinarily generous of all those who have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Bob referred to my interest in films, I wrote down the opening of John Huston's film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean</EMPHASIS>, which ran, `This is not the way it was, it's the way it should have been.' To everyone who has spoken, and spoken with such very real decency and generosity, thank you. I begin by thanking my friend Senator Gareth Evans. There is no doubt that in Gareth Evans we have quite an extraordinary Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have served three Labor prime ministers&mdash;Whitlam, Hawke and Keating&mdash;all of whom have been outstanding in different ways. I have served three Labor premiers in New South Wales&mdash;Wran,  Unsworth and Carr&mdash;all of whom are very dedicated in different ways. There is no doubt in my mind that, for the future, I can see a number of figures in the parliamentary Labor Party who are capable of assuming the prime ministership&mdash;I am thinking of Kim Beazley and Michael Lee in the House of Representatives and Gareth Evans in this chamber. I thank Minister Lee in particular for coming across tonight. It is a very decent thing to do for an old friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that chairing the joint committee on foreign affairs, which was a recommendation of my friend Chris Schacht&mdash;to work towards chairing the joint committee and the human rights subcommittee and make that a political objective&mdash;has been a great experience, a privilege, a joy. Very often we dealt with extremely complex issues in the range of interests demonstrated on the committee and the range of objectives which the parliament set us, and very often there were difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall, Senator Harradine, the most difficult question ever put to a guest being a question about, `Would a nuclear war between two countries be in the Australian national interest?' I will not mention the distinguished congressman who asked that question, but that did tax my powers of patience and response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee, though, endeavours all the time around the table to make a contribution to policy, to influence policy for the better, to reflect&mdash;in Sam Rayburn's classic expression&mdash;the fact that `disputes over external relations, be they matters of foreign affairs, defence or trade, really should stop at the water's edge'. That has been the case with the delegations in which I have been involved. I reflect on just three or four of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael MacKellar and I were in Russia at the end of 1993, for example, as international monitors for the democratic election, beginning in Khabarovsk at a quarter to eight in the morning where the temperature was minus 27 degrees. The cold was so extreme, it was in our respiratory systems. But it was a task that we were asked to fulfil, and we were proud to be involved on behalf of the Australian parliament in ensuring that the democratic process was free and fair&mdash;which it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Lee and I had been in Nepal some two years earlier for the same purpose&mdash;to witness the first democratic expression of the people of Nepal in nearly four decades. I recall being on the Chinese border on the Friendship Ridge, as I recall, Senator Bourne, between Tibet and Nepal, and looking very carefully into that country and thinking to myself: I hope to come back when there is a democratic Tibet to neighbour a democratic Nepal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne, Senator Calvert, Mr Sinclair, Mr Knott and I went to Bougainville&mdash;a great experience for us. We endeavoured to find solutions to a war that had claimed at least 3,000 lives and displaced at least 50,000 and probably close to 100,000 people. It was a tragedy on a scale in our region that really caused us to recognise a particular Australian responsibility. The report we wrote was unanimous and shifted opinion in Papua New Guinea and changed opinion in Australia. Ian Sinclair said to me just the other day that he regarded that report in all his long time in parliament as being the most influential in which he had ever been involved. So to Rwanda and other parts of Africa earlier this year, and then to Vietnam just recently, but working on the basis that the parliament can influence foreign policy, should influence foreign policy&mdash;and a close working relationship with the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Trade or the Minister for Defence really assists in that process. It is a process of working with people; not endeavouring to score points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that we have to sharpen the differences from time to time; that is part of the democratic system. I acknowledge that we have to confront each other as political players on issues, and that is healthy. There will be some issues on which there will be really quite distinct differences of emphasis, priority and philosophy&mdash;in matters of economy and industrial relations perhaps. But very often the parliament can achieve a great deal more where we focus over time, produce policy options, argue them through and then arrive at a consensus. The work on APEC, for example, in which Senator McMullan has been so intimately involved over the last few years, is a good example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, parliament should always endeavour to reflect&mdash;to use Gough Whitlam's great expression&mdash;the intelligent anticipation of change when it comes to the country's external affairs. They are just so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Travelling abroad has caused me on any number of occasions to be so proud of what our people do. I am referring to the Australian Defence Force, our police, our electoral officials, our humanitarian agencies, our non-government organisations and our people who go into extremely difficult and dangerous places and always perform with credit and great courage. Whether it be in a refugee camp in Kibeho in Rwanda, whether it be in the black townships outside Johannesburg, whether it be in a Salvation Army hospital for AIDS in Zambia or whether it be in forestry in remote areas of Nepal, in any number of instances I have been able to witness this dedication first hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the presence of our delegations&mdash;I trust to reinforce this&mdash;not only is the Australian parliament interested in what our people are doing abroad to better the capacity of mankind to achieve, but we are committed to those projects. We are involved and committed. I hope for the future in an honorary capacity that I will be able to keep up those interests. I have had approaches from several human rights groups to do some voluntary work and I am more than pleased to be involved in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry, Senator Baume, but in response to your very generous remarks, the last movement on the political spectrum for me has been from democratic socialist to social democrat. I will be Labor until I cast my last vote but that does not mean that there are not any number of occasions when it is possible to work and find common purpose and common ground with people opposite and people in the other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall miss the camaraderie and I shall miss the friendships&mdash;friendships that I had when I arrived, as with Bob and Gerry and Schachty and a whole lot of other people; new friendships that I have made, as with Kim; and friendships that go back a long way, as with my colleagues from New South Wales, Sue, Belinda and Michael in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I have learned&mdash;and I say this without fear of contradiction&mdash;is that in politics no-one has a monopoly on wisdom, no matter what your political commitment and no matter what your particular philosophical position. No matter how experienced you believe you happen to be or your party happens to be, there is always opportunity to hear another person's point of view and to try to work useful and valuable ideas into the process. That has been a strength of our party over a very long period. We have had over a century of experience to learn not only by our successes but, more importantly, by our mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Senate to always look forward&mdash;I am thinking of Senator Peter Baume's retirement speech when I say this&mdash;really involves this chamber being part of a process which I hope will be bipartisan. I have always regarded my party as the agent of change; I still do and I always shall. That is not to say that other people and other parties do not make contributions very often and very significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention three issues in particular in which I trust the Senate will be involved. The creation of an Australian republic with an Australian head of state is one. This is not something about which we should be arguing. There are no political points in this. There were no political points once Henry Parkes decided to bring New South Wales into the federation in 1895. Once Parkes scotched the idea of renaming New South Wales `Australia' and going it alone, it was going to be an Australian federation. And it is going to be an Australian republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust as part of that process of constitutional modernisation and reform that we shall have a Bill of Rights which is endorsed by the Australian people which guarantees and protects human rights in this country and gives our judiciary a series of guidelines within which they operate. If the parliament does not create a Bill of Rights, the Australian judiciary will create it for us. Where there is a vacuum, it will always be filled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the parliament itself, I ask that the recommendation of the human rights subcommittee&mdash;which was endorsed unanimously by the subcommittee and which came into the parliament and appears to have been embraced&mdash;for the creation of a joint standing committee of the Australian parliament on Australian human rights, become a reality in the next parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human rights subcommittee does sterling work. Every shade of opinion is represented on that body. It does outstanding work. Some of the issues with which we deal are the stuff of nightmares. The committee has been very effective. We have looked not only at circumstances abroad but at circumstances in our own country&mdash;for example, circumstances of our own Aboriginal people in remote communities&mdash;in so far as the international human rights instruments are concerned. The new joint standing committee on human rights will be able to achieve far more for our own people in relation to Australia's role in the region and Australia's role in world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very active in the United Nations since its inception, particularly in respect of peacekeeping. Virtually every major peacekeeping mission has involved Australian personnel at one level or another. I believe the creation of a joint standing committee on human rights can only reinforce those very positive, purposeful and constructive tendencies in our parliament and in our political culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Malouf wrote brilliantly of the `Great World' not so long ago. I am about to depart one career and enter a second career. I am looking forward to that. I am also looking forward to spending a great deal more time with Lynne, Nicholas and James. I thank the three of them most sincerely for their support over a very long period of time. For example, James has grown up without me being around, and that is something that has caused me to think about the future. They have been extraordinary in terms of the amount of support which they have given me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to continue the remarks that I began last evening on CSL&mdash;on its work before it was privatised and since it has been privatised and on the work of the Commonwealth department of health in relation to the supervision of CSL in the products that it made and the products that it makes now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I left these remarks last night, I was speaking about the manufacture of human pituitary hormones. I pointed out that CSL had never been under a process of good management practice, and that was recognised. It had not developed proper processes of assay for its pituitary hormones. Indeed, many of the pituitary glands that had been collected from overseas had been collected under unsterile conditions. Pyrogenic batches were produced and these were distributed to Australian patients. In connection with that, CSL had not been employing a microbiologist on its staff&mdash;or in the team manufacturing hormones&mdash;in order to protect the Australian public against the hepatitis B virus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to continue by pointing out that today I have sought, through the FOI, a number of documents relating to the procedures used to assess the health status of foreign donors of either blood, blood fractions or tissue, the safety associated with the methods of collection, storage and transfer of these materials and the processes used for the inactivation of any disease carrying entity that may have been in any of these products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there is a great deal of written documentary material on these matters. I know that some of this material is marked `never to be destroyed'. I fear there is a very strong temptation to destroy much of this material that would prove very damaging to CSL if it were released. I urge the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to give a firm undertaking that none of that material will find its way to the shredder, the waste bin or the incinerator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue specifically with the history of CSL, its secrecy and its lack of openness in relation to pituitary hormones. Long before the Therapeutic Goods Administration's recent efforts to deny any possible link between CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and blood or blood products, the health department had sent medical details and names of hormone recipients to a range of medical institutions around Australia, including blood banks, advising that the hormone recipients were a risk as donors of human tissue, including blood. Recipients were not told that this data was sent. Therefore, there is a serious inconsistency in the behaviour of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's answers to a long and important series of questions put by my colleague Senator Meg Lees and by opposition senator Kay Patterson, through the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee last November, were released three months later. These provide many examples of secrecy, evasion, ducking and redefining the question. They demonstrate that these matters cannot be determined adequately by such exchanges and require, as I indicated last night, the forum of a committee inquiry to nail down the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that neither the health department nor CSL, which made the pituitary hormones and blood products, revealed, until the company was up for sale in May last year, that CSL had engaged in the intrinsically unsafe practice of making blood products from human placentae. Strong evidence is emerging that senior CSL Ltd personnel responsible for blood product manufacture believed their virus inactivation and manufacturing techniques can eliminate disease agents. This is a deadly and serious state of affairs. It could lead the company to again mix human with inferior foreign or other material, as it has in the past. It has grave implications for the health of CSL workers and transport personnel and could cause the company to not issue safety and risk warnings about its products. I query whether a corporation which holds this belief is fit to fractionate our blood plasma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the corporation knowingly and intentionally appropriated Red Cross blood clotting factors which had been bailed to them in trust that they would be returned to Red Cross. Instead, CSL Ltd secretly sent products to an overseas government, or the government's blood banking agents, evading Customs clearance. CSL, it appears, failed to report this incident under trade practices law, when it learnt the products were contaminated with hepatitis C. Other allegations of CSL routinely sending Red Cross material to foreign countries without Red Cross knowledge or consent have been ignored by the minister and her department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL has long brought in foreign plasma to process and return for a commercial fee. The Hong Kong incident shows it was willing to bring in plasma with high levels of infectious disease for processing in the same machinery as processed Australian plasma. CSL misleads the public by claiming that foreign plasma is required to meet WHO standards, as if this were a good thing. Let an open inquiry hear what Australian Red Cross thinks of the WHO standards for blood donors. Let us compare those standards with the standards required by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1957 and at least 1990, CSL secretly mixed Red Cross donor plasma with plasma from overseas countries having lower health and testing standards than our own. This made a mockery of Red Cross efforts over decades to provide only the best available plasma for Australian blood products. The company has lied about the practice on a number of occasions since last October while insisting that there is no evidence of harm from the practice. So why should they lie about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the company's statement tabled in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 9 February this year, segregation of all plasmas for the manufacture of products exclusively for each country of plasma origin was commenced in 1992. Alarmingly, CSL in 1995 reveals that `as the volume of plasma supplied by various countries increased it became possible to segregate plasma'. Yet it was economies of scale&mdash;that is, not enough bucks in observing health standards&mdash;which prompted the company to mix plasmas in the first place. How can we believe the head of the bioplasma division, who told assembled journalists last October, `I must be honest with you. My greatest concern is for the health care community of Australia,' when the company itself reveals this kind of motivation after it has been supposedly reformed as we were told?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there a conflict of interest in having our plasma processed under community service obligations by an internationalised corporation which is avowedly profitmaking and persists in judging its role as our national blood fractionator by the inferior benchmark of international standards? Is there a conflict of interest in CSL providing plasma based clotting factors while holding a licence to sell the more lucrative overseas recombinant product?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another matter the government and CSL prefer to treat with complete silence. We have evidence that CSL's virus inactivation techniques in the 1980s were inadequate by the standards and limits at that time. Let me be clear about this because anyone keen to avoid blood product liability loves to argue that they could not have known at the time that what they were doing was harmful or risky&mdash;`20-20 hindsight' and `state-of-the-art' are the chorus lines they like to throw up when anyone tries to sing about the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are the minister and her department showing no interest in this matter? CSL escaped negligence claims for HIV contaminated blood when haemophiliacs contracted AIDS. In the same year it claimed to have stopped mixing, but it never told about the mixing in court, and the health department, which paid up indirectly for CSL's share of liability, never told about the mixing. No-one told the judges in the court and no-one told the public in the prospectus. That is a second very important point for the 100 per cent public sale of CSL last May. I see that I am not going to finish this speech tonight so I will finish at that point and conclude when next we meet. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Service personnel have been lied to and misled by Mr Baume.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not in the habit of lying to service personnel or anyone else. I never had to lie to service personnel to win my seat when I was in the House of Representatives, unlike the  present member for Throsby, who at that stage won the seat of Macarthur with the same kind of disgraceful campaigning that the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used to win the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge Mr Hollis to produce any evidence that he has received a couple of defamation writs from me. That is simply false.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also deal with another matter that he raised in attacking me. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Baume also misrepresented me in that he claimed I had given myself funds from my former employer, the Workers Education Association, which were retrospectively agreed to. This is simply not so&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only funds I received from the WEA were my severance pay and contributions I made to my superannuation. I have documentary evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA>I have some documentary evidence in relation to that matter about which Mr Hollis may be interested. It deals with a complaint by the state president of the Workers Education Association in a press release dated March 1983. The state president of the Workers Education Association of New South Wales at the time&mdash;he has unfortunately since died&mdash;David Ryan, Mr Hollis's employer, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was contacted by a reporter on Tuesday 1st March 1983 and that reporter indicated that he intended to have published an article relating to Mr. Hollis and his dealings with the WEA and sought my confirmation of certain elements of the rumour which he informed me were circulating in the Macarthur electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediately it became apparent to me that this matter had become part of the public arena, I travelled to Wollongong to attempt to find out information which would permit me to make a statement denying the truth of the rumour circulating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was unable to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directors of the company have been endeavouring for over six months to obtain information from the Wollongong branch about payments made to Mr. Hollis&mdash;these efforts have proved unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on at some length about the extraordinary behaviour of Mr Hollis to him as president when he was trying to find out what had happened to this money. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of this, the publicity already surrounding this matter, and my inability to obtain the information I sought on Tuesday last, I have now requested the firm of Coopers and Lybrand, auditors of the WEA, to conduct a full investigation of the books of the WEA in Wollongong, and will raise this matter at the next meeting of the board of directors on 12th March 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret that the actions taken by Mr. Hollis on Tuesday 1st March 1983 precluded me from making any statement of a substantive nature relating to the rumours circulating regarding the propriety of financial dealings between Mr. Hollis and the Wollongong branch of the WEA as I believe that, had I been in a position to make those substantive statements, it would have been in the public interest, in the best interests of the WEA, and in the best interests of Mr. Hollis, that those statements be made as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I deplore the need to issue this news release and I deplore the fact that the WEA, a non-political body dedicated to the provision of adult education, through no fault of its own, finds its organisation embroiled in a political campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>If Mr Hollis wants to, I suggest he table the Coopers and Lybrand inquiry. Perhaps, in order to avoid a scandal, he might also like to produce the minutes which retrospectively approve the payments that he made to himself and which were the cause of such concern by the former state president of the WEA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might suggest to Mr Hollis that if he is now in the mood to start revealing court matters he might like to deal with the way in which he sought to sue Mr Cobb. Eventually he withdrew that action because ultimately he did not think it appropriate for one member to take out defamation proceedings against another. He might also like to deal at some length with the prosecution that was successful against him in the Melbourne magistrates court. Frankly, I am sick and tired of Mr Hollis attacking me on a personal basis. I find it contemptible that he should say yesterday, when talking about my speech:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter which has been of concern to me for quite a period of time now&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank and the promises that were made by Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner to the employees of that bank. I think it is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labor Party believes in nothing in terms of its philosophical position, but one hoped that it would believe in at least keeping election promises. I remind colleagues that the Commonwealth Bank was one of those Labor Party icons. How long ago was it when a Labor Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas?  But as the people of Australia come to realise the extent of the economic and social vandalism  proposed by our opponents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>What we were talking about was privatising Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. It was Mr Hawke who made those comments. Then he continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it will be necessary for us&mdash;Ben Chifley's great heirs and successors&mdash;to keep fresh and green the memory, the example and the experience of this great Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Bank is now going entirely from public ownership without a whimper or a protest from any member within the Labor Party. Such is the commitment of the Labor Party to any consistent philosophy or approach. No wonder so many Australians think this Keating Labor Party has nothing in common with the Labor Party of old&mdash;no matter what the current wordsmiths might try to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The issue which has emerged in recent days very powerfully in the House of Representatives is the promises made by Mr Keating and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to keep the majority shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank in public ownership. This is not a promise which is cost free. Madam Deputy President, you may remember that the Commonwealth Bank was merged with the State Bank of Victoria following the disastrous mismanagement of the Cain and Kirner governments in my home state. A press release was issued at that time in which Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner announced the process by which the State Bank of Victoria would be merged with the Commonwealth Bank. A joint press statement issued by the then federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, and Mrs Joan Kirner states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She said the Government had received two very good offers for the bank by the deadline of late Saturday. She said the CBA offer of $1600 million for assets and goodwill was $55 million lower than that of the other main bidder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kirner said that in agreeing to the Commonwealth Bank offer, the Government took into account the relative closeness of the bids along with other considerations. Those included the security to depositors provided by Federal Government control and the community's desire to keep SBV's operations publicly controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Taking those other factors into account, the Government decided that, given the relative closeness of the offers, the CBA offer was the one which best served the interests of SBV depositors and all Victorians," she said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It ensures the bank remains publicly-controlled and significantly strengthens the public banking sector.</PARA>
<PARA>That particular promise made by Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner cost Victorians $55 million. The Victorian government accepted $55 million less because they wanted to favour a publicly owned bank which Mr Keating, despite his election promises, has decided to fully privatise&mdash;following the coalition policy which has been our policy for a very long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this merger, some other promises were made by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating. They said that there would be no compulsory retrenchments as a result of the merger. Whether they should have made that promise or not is not a matter for debate here tonight. The fact is that another Labor promise was made. Since the merger, on the latest figures available, some 8,300 Victorians have been retrenched from the merged bank. That is almost the same number that were employed in the State Bank of Victoria when it was a stand-alone entity. Many of those would have been compulsorily retrenched, and others would have taken voluntary retirement. However, many who took voluntary retirement have gone public and have said that it was more akin to a forced retrenchment. As a Victorian senator, I have been very keen to track what the State Bank of Victoria has been doing. The management took the decision to strip all headquarter activities of the State Bank out of Victoria and transfer them to Sydney, causing further unemployment in our state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put a further three questions on notice in the last month or so. In the first I referred to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 27 February 1995, which indicated that there had been 260 management and executive appointments made from outside the bank since February 1993, and asked whether that figure was correct. The bank had a lot of management in Victoria, but apparently a lot of managers had to be recruited from outside. I was told that these are matters for the management of the bank and, furthermore, that the provision of answers would release information which is of a commercially sensitive nature. In other words, when I asked how many managers have been appointed from outside in the past, the answer is apparently of a commercially sensitive nature, thereby resulting in a competitive disadvantage to the bank. That was one question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Then I asked how many of the 8,300 full-time positions removed from the bank were compulsory redundancies. Again, I was told that these were of a commercially sensitive nature, and no answers were given. Thirdly, I asked how many branches the Commonwealth Bank planned to close in Victoria in the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 and how many staff will be lost as a result of that. These again were regarded as being of a commercially sensitive nature. One could argue that the last question is commercially sensitive, although I would dispute that, but the first two questions are not commercially sensitive. They are politically sensitive, because they expose the lies of Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner. I give notice in this chamber that I am singularly unsatisfied with those answers&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the crisis facing small business in the Hunter which is now sending out a mayday alarm for help. Tonight I am pleased to see that the duty minister is the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht). The closure of small business units in the Hunter is now happening at the rate of one a day, which is a truly alarming figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already the President of the Hunter Regional Small Business Persons Association, John Farragher, says that some 3,000 small business units have shut in the Hunter in the last four years. Hurt and despair is now surfacing and proud and independent shopkeepers are demanding to be heard. Small businesses in the Hunter are facing reduced demand. They are cutting employment and capital funds are being lost. The irony is that consumers, who are avoiding these small businesses for some of the chain stores to save a few dollars on a basket of groceries, should not be surprised if their children have no work because of small business closures at the rate that is occurring in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hunter small business includes fruit shops, chemists, delicatessens, butchers, bakeries and takeaway food stores. Many of these are becoming unviable and closing. Unconscionable conduct in trading practices by quite a number of the large chain stores is responsible for a lot of this. Misuse of market power and predatory pricing by some of the chains is one of the major problems facing these small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some shopping centre managers are restricting hours and even restricting the trading policies of some small businesses, with examples like bread shops not being able to sell bread rolls because of the competition this puts them in with some of the larger businesses in the centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business owners have told me the nub of their problems. For the minister's edification, here are some of the problems that they are facing. Ten years ago in this state we had over 2,000 independent bakeries. These have now shrunk to eight and the chains, open for 24 hours a day in many cases, are baking their own bread. Chemists are being decimated. The pharmaceutical companies are offering a very large range of lines now through the chains. Delicatessen turnover has dropped by half and the chains are selling similar lines at half price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supply and distribution network in the Hunter for small business is now starting to break down as small stores close. Coke recently closed its Newcastle distribution point. This has flow-on effects to other jobs&mdash;packers, forklift drivers and carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a response from the business community to this developing crisis in the Hunter. Newcastle small business representatives wrote to Minister Schacht and the letter outlined the problem in the way in which I have informed the Senate tonight. On 8 February back came a very unsympathetic reply from the minister. His letter was read to a 500-strong crowd of small business people in Newcastle. You should have been there, Minister, to hear their reaction to your words. I will not quote the whole letter because of lack of time but let me give you some of the flavour of it. I quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth to establish mechanisms to reduce competition in the marketplace . . . . unfortunately it is the larger supermarkets who are best placed to meet these new demands.</PARA>
<PARA>This is from the minister for small business. Maybe he should rename his ministry the ministry for big business if his interjections a few minutes ago are any indication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction to the letter ranged from anger to misbelief&mdash;that the Australian minister for small business could just say, `Small business in this country can just sink or swim.' This federal Labor government's sink or swim attitude to the plight of small business comes not only from the minister; it comes from the very top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) finetuned some of his invective to tell struggling small business owners to consider their future employment options. Paul Keating was at his most insulting to small business on ABC radio in Queensland earlier today&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they're feeling the pinch it is in the highest growth economy we have ever had; we've been growing at 5 to six per cent with 2 per cent so if they are feeling the pinch they should say "small business is not for me because it's never going to get any better."</PARA>
<PARA>This lecture comes from a Prime Minister responsible for record interest rates, an arthritic industrial relations system and a range of other policies that have severely hurt small businesses in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 years this range of policies including taxes, industrial relations and red tape have greatly reduced the capacity and the potential for a very wide range of small businesses. But fortunately for Australia, despite the government's policies, we find small businesses are a very committed breed. They commit the life savings of their business and mortgages of their home to provide what they hope is a sound and secure future for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot let the small businesses in this country that are in crisis just wither and die, which is increasingly the outcome of this Labor government's policy. Small business growth in Australia in the early 1990s brought us out of the recession with the creation of 550,000 new jobs&mdash;and this has been the pattern overseas as well. We really depend for growth on small businesses&mdash;but it needs supporting policies for it to happen. In the United States, for example, in the 1980s not one new net job was added by big business or government to the employment pool. It all came from small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government must do is create a climate that will allow our small businesses to flourish. It must create a regulatory system which will allow small businesses to flourish. But that is not happening, as we now have the predatory chain stores being able to destroy the viability of the little guy. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to say small businesses go broke every day. With appropriate policies many could prosper and create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, people are going into business and out of business all the time, but under this government's policies more and more are going out of business. If the government is really interested in creating lasting employment in this country, it should be supporting them and not standing back and watching them be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business mayday call forum in Newcastle is a backlash to this ALP government's negative approach to small business. On Friday, 19 May the Sandgate regional fruit and vegetable markets in Newcastle are expecting a turnout of over 1,500 people. They want the state and federal government ministers responsible to listen to the real problems and act with real policy changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Schacht has been invited to Newcastle. We sincerely hope that he comes. This might get his feet back on the ground. He might have a chance to listen to the real problems that have been outlined tonight from the people who are really hurting from his government's policies. It is not good enough for a minister who has had no experience in small business to listen to bureaucrats who probably have not had any experience in business themselves. If they would get out and listen to what is happening to the real people in this country, perhaps they might come up with some measures to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that function the rest of Australia will see this plight even though the minister seems to refuse to see it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> from the Nine Network will be there. ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> is onto this crisis. They will be reporting the Mayday forum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Defence Offset arrangements in relation to the F/A-18 program are described in the Deed between McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) and the Commonwealth of Australia for "Australian Industry Participation in the New Tactical Fighter Program" dated 1 December 1981 and as amended. This Deed benefits in excess of 50 Australian owned or Australian based firms, such as Hawker de Havilland, British Aerospace Australia, AWA and Comsteel, through offsets to a current total value of approximately $US334M (1981 prices).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The ADF in this and following questions is taken to mean the Defence Organisation. MDC had responsibility for selection of any Australian firms to be used in conjunction with the F/A-18 program. MDC used in excess of 220 Australian based firms during the F/A-18 program. The Commonwealth of Australia stipulated the use of the Government Aircraft Factory and Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation to ensure certain strategic skills and capabilities continued to be available in Australian industry post production of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The separate, and draft only, Offsets Credit Deed (Number DID/1123) with MDC, which has been developed over the period 1990 to 1995, provides the vehicle for MDC to satisfy its offset obligation under the contract (C218380) for provision of MMS to the RAN.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) to (7) Yes, IMS was involved in the Offsets Credits arrangement described in the answer to (3) above with MDC. McDonnell Douglas Aerospace&mdash;West proposed to transfer to IMS excess Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing equipment, also known as the printed wire board facility. This Deed has not yet been executed by the Commonwealth. The arrangements between IMC and MDC continue to fit the technical criteria for eligibility. However, given the facts now available, further discussions are being held with MDC on its eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) There are no additional costs, other than administrative, to the Department of Defence associated with the MDC arrangements. The Defence Offsets Program provides the opportunity for overseas firms to discharge Australian industry involvement obligations arising from contracts with the Department of Defence through activities other than the use of local industry. These activities, such as training Australian industry, transfer of intellectual property, sponsorship of Australian research and development or provision of new technology, are in addition to the provision of the goods and/or services under the contract and are at no cost to the Commonwealth. Valuation of offsets allows acquittal of the obligation, which is specified as a percentage of the contract value, once the Australian beneficiary firm confirms achievement of the activity. The procedure is that the offsets credits are banked against the obligation following a request from the overseas company and approval by the Commonwealth. The Australian beneficiary must satisfy the Commonwealth that the activities have occurred before the Commonwealth would award the offset credits to the overseas firm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Defence Offsets Program is managed by the Department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(36) The determination of suitability is either a formal evaluation during the source selection process in response to tenders or informal in other matters and based on the judgement of Defence staff interacting with the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(37) Yes, the CJC informed the Defence Inspector General on 31 August 1994. However, the export control administration had determined previously that the semi-conductors concerned were commercial, not military, components. All indications to Defence are that the semi-conductors were shipped to the USA and this is not in contravention of Australian laws. The semi-conductors are of Japanese origin and therefore US laws are not applicable in exporting them from Australia. UN bans, in the form of sanctions or resolutions concerning exports, are normally given legislative backing in Australia under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. The US is not a proscribed country in this case and thus no UN bans have been violated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(38) Australia maintains an export control regime, administered by Defence, to ensure that Australia does not export controlled goods to countries subject to UN sanctions or against Australian export legislation. While Australia does not recognise the extra-territorial application of US laws we advise persons intending to re-export US sourced goods to check with US authorities on whether permission is needed from that administration.</PARA>
