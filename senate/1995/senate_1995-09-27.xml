<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill responds to the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh, handed down on 7 April 1995. It follows a Joint Statement by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 10 May 1995 on behalf of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court decision raises the issue of the role of international law in Australian law. It raises a fundamental question about our system of parliamentary law-making in Australia: should it be by-passed to allow for treaties to have direct effect in Australian law?  Or should, as the Government believes, the role of changing Australian law to conform with treaty obligations remain with the democratically elected Parliament of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before outlining the aim of the bill, and the reasons behind its enactment, it is useful to give a short description of the facts of the Teoh case, and the reasoning in the judgment of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Teoh was a Malaysian citizen who came to Australia on 5 May 1988 and was granted a temporary entry permit. On 9 July 1988 he married an Australian citizen. At the time of the marriage Mrs Teoh had four children. Later, Mr and Mrs Teoh had three more children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1988 Mr Teoh applied for and was granted a further temporary entry permit which allowed him to remain in Australia until 5 February 1989. Before that permit had expired he applied for a permanent entry permit, otherwise known as a grant of resident status. In November 1990, when his application for resident status was still pending, Mr Teoh was convicted of six counts of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin and of three counts of being in possession of heroin. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and eight months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January 1991, Mr Teoh was informed that his application for permanent resident status had been refused because he did not satisfy the requirement of good character. That requirement applies to all applicants over 16 years of age. One of the bases of assessment of good character is whether the applicant has a criminal record. It was decided that he did not meet the good character requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On review, the Immigration Review Panel recommended that the delegate's decision to refuse permanent resident status be affirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reaching that decision, the Panel did not ignore the interests of the children. The decision recorded that Mrs Teoh and family were facing a very bleak and difficult future and would be deprived of a possible breadwinner as well as a father and husband if resident status was not granted. However, the applicant had committed a very serious crime and failed to meet the character requirements for the granting of permanent residency. The compassionate claims were not considered to be compelling enough for the waiver of policy in view of Mr Teoh's criminal record.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Teoh then appealed to the Federal Court. At first instance, his claim was dismissed, but he appealed to the Full Federal Court which found in his favour. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs then appealed that decision to the High Court. The High Court decided in favour of Mr Teoh. The decision to deport Mr Teoh was stayed until the application for the grant of residence status was reconsidered and determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reaching this decision, the High Court relied heavily on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty which has not been incorporated into Australian law. The High Court focused on Article 3(l) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That article provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court found in effect, that the best interests of Mr Teoh's children had not been `a primary consideration' in the making of the decision not to grant him permanent resident status. The decision of the Immigration Review Panel shows, however, as I have indicated, that it was not the case that their interests were ignored. Nevertheless, this was not considered sufficient by the majority of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Teoh case the High Court held that the ratification of a treaty by Australia creates a legitimate expectation that the Executive Government and its agencies will act in accordance with the treaty provisions, even if they have not been legislated into Australian law. If it is proposed to make a decision inconsistent with that legitimate expectation, it was held that procedural fairness requires that the person affected be given notice and an adequate opportunity to reply. A legitimate expectation amounts only to a procedural right to have the treaty considered, as opposed to a legal right to enforce the terms of the treaty. A decision maker can still decide the other way, so long as she or he has heard the applicant on the issue. However, that is still a significant right. The majority of the Court also held that this legitimate expectation could be displaced by a statutory or executive indication to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the Teoh decision, the terms of treaties had not been considered to create rights or obligations in Australian law in the absence of legislation. The High Court confirmed this principle in Teoh. However, the Court distinguished between a substantive rule of law and a legitimate expectation that a decision maker will comply with the terms of a treaty. This distinction would have been likely to disappear in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's view that the High Court's decision leads to an untenable situation. It is the Government's role to represent Australia on the international plane and this includes international treaty making. However, any changes to the laws of this country which are necessary to implement a treaty and which affect the rights and duties of individuals are a matter for Parliament. In the Government's view, the Teoh decision provides a means of usurping this legitimate role of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the new procedural right will have significant practical consequences in relation to the myriad of Commonwealth decisions made every day by large numbers of individual decision makers. A substantial allocation of resources would have been necessary. All government decision makers exercising discretionary decision making power would have needed to be educated about the numerous treaty obligations to which Australia is a party. Furthermore, by reason of the new procedural right, there would be likely to be a significant increase in the number of decisions appealed. Even on a re-hearing, there would not be a requirement that a decision maker act in accordance with any relevant international obligations. In the Government's view, it is wrong for treaties to have this effect domestically without the law being changed by Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a party to over 920 treaties. Australia does not normally become a party to a treaty unless and until it is satisfied that the laws and practices to give effect to that treaty are in place. Therefore the difficulty created by the High Court's decision is twofold: first to determine which treaties could be relevant to a particular decision. Secondly, it would be necessary for the decision maker to determine the precise meaning of a treaty provision in a particular context. This would not lead to consistency in the interpretation of treaties or in decision making. For example, it can be argued that the Convention on the Rights of the Child does not require a different outcome from that reached by the department in Mr Teoh's case. Certainly that was the view of McHugh J dissenting in that case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it has been suggested incorrectly that the bill winds back Australia's commitment to human rights. That ongoing commitment is demonstrated by the continuing importance of the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. One of the functions of the Commission as set out in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 is to hear and conciliate complaints about Commonwealth acts and practices which are alleged to breach human rights set out in the instruments scheduled to the act. Those instruments are: the Convention Concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Declaration of the Rights of the Child; the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons; and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. In 1993 the Convention on the Rights of the Child was declared an instrument relating to human rights and freedoms under the act, as was the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this mechanism, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 provide a legal framework in which the rights they contain are respected in Australia. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is scheduled to the Racial Discrimination Act, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women is scheduled to the Sex Discrimination Act. Similarly, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is scheduled to the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the domestic remedies specifically provided by Parliament to deal with complaints of breaches of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the terms of the bill itself. The bill is very narrowly focused. It will restore the situation which existed before the Teoh case. That is, if there are to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from adherence to a treaty, they will result from Parliamentary and not executive action. The bill gives effect to the statement by the majority of the High Court that a legitimate expectation arising out of entry into a treaty by Australia can be displaced by executive or legislative action. In this respect it gives legislative effect to the Joint Statement issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself on 10 May of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has a very confined field of operation: it only prevents a legitimate expectation from arising based on the fact that Australia is bound by, or a party to, a particular international instrument, or that an enactment reproduces or refers to a particular international instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, the bill will eliminate any expectation which might exist that administrative decisions, whether at the Commonwealth, State or Territory level, will be made in conformity with provisions of ratified but unimplemented treaties, or, that if a decision is to be made contrary to such provisions, an opportunity will be given for the affected person to make submissions on the issue. That is clause 5, the only substantive clause in the bill. As I will outline below, the bill will not affect other uses of international law in Australia. For instance, the bill will not affect the use of international law by the courts in the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions; nor will it affect their use of international law as a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason the bill is expressed to extend to State and Territory decisions is based on the reasoning of the majority judgment of the High Court in the Teoh case. The Court found that it was the Commonwealth act of ratification of a treaty which gave rise domestically to the legitimate expectation that administrative decision makers would comply with the terms of those treaties, or, if they did not intend to do so, that they would hear submissions on them. It is not certain from the judgment whether the administrative decisions affected by that Commonwealth act are only those of the Commonwealth Government, or whether they are also those of the State and Territory administrations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since ratification of a treaty is a Commonwealth executive action, it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate to control the effect of that action in Australian domestic law generally. The bill does not prevent any State which wishes to do so from passing a law or taking its own executive actions in relation to treaties accepted by Australia which might themselves create a legitimate expectation. In that case, the legitimate expectation would flow from the State law, and not the Commonwealth executive act of ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the bill put it beyond doubt that Parliament is not affecting the way in which treaties may otherwise have some relevance in Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 provides that the bill will not affect the operation of treaty provisions which have been incorporated into Australian law. An example is certain of the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which form part of Australian law as provided for in the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7 provides that the bill does not affect the operation of an enactment in so far as it provides for remedies against, or any procedures for redress of grievances in respect of, breaches of international instruments binding on Australia, or to which Australia is a party. In particular, the bill does not affect the operation of procedures available under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 8 provides that the bill does not affect the operation of an enactment in so far as it provides that compliance with an international instrument is a relevant consideration in making an administrative decision. Nor does the bill make compliance with an international instrument an irrelevant consideration in making an administrative decision where that would otherwise be consistent with the scope and object of the particular statutory provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I mentioned earlier and as the explanatory memorandum makes it clear the use of treaties by the courts both in statutory interpretation and in the development of the common law will not be affected by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane referred to two uses of treaties in relation to statutory interpretation in their joint judgment in the Teoh case. The first is that "64 where a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the courts should favour that construction which accords with Australia's obligations under a treaty or international convention to which Australia is a party. . . ". The second is that ". . . a statute is to be interpreted and applied, as far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity and not in conflict with established rules of international law." The bill does not affect either of these canons of statutory interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane also stated in the Teoh case that "[t]he provisions of an international convention to which Australia is a party, especially one that declares universal fundamental rights, may be used by the courts as a legitimate guide in developing the common law". In making this statement their Honours relied upon a number of earlier judgments to the same effect made by Judges of the High Court. They also relied upon a 1988 decision of Justice Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, in Jago v. Judges of district of New South Wales in which he stated that "[a] more relevant source of guidance in the statement of the common law of this State may be the modern instruments of human rights found in international instruments, prepared by experts, adopted by organs of the United Nations, ratified by Australia and now part of international law."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does not affect the future use of treaties to which Australia is a party as a source of guidance in the development of the common law. They will remain, in the words of the current Chief Justice of the High Court a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law. This influence of treaties on the development of the common law is to be distinguished from simply importing the terms of an unincorporated convention into Australian law without legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will apply to administrative decisions, made on or after 10 May 1995, including such decisions reviewing, or determining an appeal in respect of, decisions made before that day. This reflects the Government's belief that by reason of the Joint Statement issued on that date by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General, no legitimate expectations will have arisen on the basis of an international instrument after 10 May 1995, and the legislation is designed to reinforce this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government's decision to legislate in the way I have indicated has been criticised as inconsistent with Australia's commitment to meet its treaty obligations. The Government has reaffirmed its commitment in this regard. It does wish to ensure that its treaty commitments are met, including in administrative decision making. However, for the reasons indicated, it does not believe the Teoh decision is the way to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to determine whether there are in fact problem areas in administrative decision making in terms of compliance with treaty obligations, the Attorney-General announced on 5 July this year that his Department will carry out a review. This review, in consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other Government departments, will initially identify areas of possible concern in relation to the compliance in administrative decisions with the human rights obligations set out in instruments attached to Commonwealth human rights legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this review is to ensure that full and proper consideration is given to those obligations in the decision making process. The reason for the review is to double check that relevant treaty obligations are being taken into account in administrative decision making, and therefore that Australia is fully implementing the international obligations towards its people that it has voluntarily assumed on the international plane. I say `double check' because international obligations have always been considered very seriously in Australian law and practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review will involve use of existing resources and the Government has not, therefore, set any timetable for its completion. If there are areas where we are not adequately meeting our treaty obligations we wish to know about them. We can then do something to remedy the situation. This review process will be much more effective than development of the doctrine of legitimate expectation to cover treaties in ensuring that proper regard is had to our treaty commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill involves no direct financial implications. Its enactment may, however, provide savings in relation to costs of legal action that might otherwise have been brought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

Because some of those people have died of the disease which is known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, the Senate would know that a very large number of other people who have been in receipt of those hormones are now suffering very severe psychiatric illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has heard of one family in which the wife received fertility hormones and then succeeded in producing several children but, as a consequence of the subsequent emergence of CJD in other recipients of these hormones, both the wife and the two children are now under constant psychiatric care. One has heard about other people who have not developed CJD but who have been under so much pressure in relation to the receipt of these hormones that they have committed suicide. In addition to the five deaths that have already occurred among these approximately 2,600 people, we have a very large number of people who feel they essentially have the sword of Damocles hanging over them, who feel themselves very much under threat, and who feel themselves absolutely affronted by what CSL did over that long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Senate does not accept an inquiry, it will force those people who are already under this considerable pressure, some of whom are very likely to die, because we know that CJD is a disease with a long latency but when it appears it progresses inexorably to death and quite rapidly, into an adversarial situation in which both the government and CSL will bring out the very best and most expensive lawyers to argue against claims for compensation for the damage these people have suffered. That is absolutely unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal very strongly to both the government and the opposition to choose this alternative route&mdash;that is, to bring it before a Senate committee in an inquiry type context to allow those scientists who have evidence, some of which I have presented here and I will go back to that in a moment, to come forward under parliamentary privilege and provide the evidence in a non-threatening environment. That should be the very foundation which will allow these people who have been so damaged to mount their cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that, while I have put before the Senate a considerable amount of evidence of damage occasioned by CSL, that is not the same as the evidence which could be brought forward under parliamentary privilege by a large number of scientists who want that protection to bring evidence before a Senate inquiry. That would establish a foundation. Those people, in a fair and open way, could then go into the courts knowing what the evidence is on which they may draw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe I could head off one of the arguments that other senators may use against this proposal by adding that, whereas it is true that the direct evidence which comes before the Senate under such a process cannot be used in a court of law&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is not evidence which can be used&mdash;that evidence can be independently derived within the court. That evidence is then perfectly valid and can be used. It provides the knowledge base which will allow these people to avoid that very arduous, very damaging adversarial process to which many of them are already committed. We are not in any sense denying those people the ability to adduce that evidence in the courts later, and we are not in any sense, by bringing this before a Senate inquiry, acting in a prospective sub judice manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to blood products, as I have pointed out in many speeches in this place, there is abundant evidence that the CSL, over a considerable period of time, was mixing blood which had originated in a large number of countries and that that information was kept from very significant recipients of some of those blood products. On 11 October last year, almost a year ago, I raised the issue of the large number of people with haemophilia who had become infected with hepatitis C. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I drew attention to the fact that, while there were only 30,000 cases of hepatitis C infection known throughout the whole of Australia&mdash;in other words, the incidence is very low at one person in 500&mdash;among the 1,600 sufferers of haemophilia, 85 per cent are suffering from hepatitis C infection. In other words, the people who have this genetic defect of not being able to make Factor VIII and who have received that Factor VIII prepared from mixed plasma&mdash;plasma which has come in from other countries and which CSL should have known was infected with hepatitis C&mdash;have suffered that very high infection rate because of their need for repeated doses of Factor VIII. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also drew attention to the fact that it is in the written record between CSL and the Red Cross that this mixing was going on. I drew attention to the fact that on 12 March 1986 the Red Cross wrote to CSL asking it not to mix plasma from foreign sources with plasma from Australia. I pointed out that Mr Neville McCarthy from CSL wrote back on 27 March 1986 defending the practice and saying that no other practice would produce the cheap product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was arguing that they needed these very large batches, which they could only get by mixing the plasma from different sources, in order to get high yields and therefore produce a product at lower cost. As a consequence, CSL would continue with the practice of mixing plasma from different countries. In response to that letter, the Red Cross wrote back on 2 May 1986, saying that in view of its legal advice&mdash;legal advice to the Red Cross in relation to the safety of its products&mdash;it would refuse to continue to use CSL products. That is all in the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we also know of that situation is that plasma was coming in from Hong Kong. We know that a hepatitis C infection in Hong Kong was so widespread that no records were being kept of blood donors in Hong Kong. No testing was being done for hepatitis C in the plasma. Everybody accepted that the plasma would be infected with hepatitis C, so what is the point in testing it? That, in fact, was then being mixed with the Australian plasma from which the Factor VIII was being prepared. Is it any wonder that 85 per cent of people with haemophilia in Australia are infected with hepatitis C?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that speech I gave in the Senate back in October last year, I then did an interview on ABC regional radio. Mr Jack Wood from CSL spoke in the same program, as well as a spokesperson from the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia. What was interesting about that interview was that the spokesperson from the haemophilia association said that they did not know. They had been asking for decades what the source of the plasma was which was the basis of the preparation of the Factor VIII which was being received by haemophilia sufferers in Australia. They had been asking for so long, and they had been denied that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is precisely the sort of thing that we are going to get when these poor people come into court and have to argue their case. We are going to get denial and obfuscation&mdash;coming from probably some of the highest paid QCs in this country&mdash;by both the government and CSL in defending their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation can be extended to a range of other products. CSL have claimed that there is no evidence of harm arising as a consequence of many of their blood products out in the community. The question that needs to be asked is: have they actually gone back and looked in detail for many of the effects which one might find? The answer there is: no, nobody has looked. The Red Cross does not keep records of people who have received blood transfusions. The Red Cross simply would not know how to follow up those people who have received those products. So the lack of evidence means that nobody has actually looked. This, of course, is precisely the sort of argument that one finds from many of the large chemical companies, the large agricultural chemical companies and the large pharmaceutical companies, when they want to try to deny that their products cause any damage whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also raised before the Senate a considerable amount of evidence in relation to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&mdash;a disease which, as I mentioned earlier, is of delayed onset. One does not know exactly what happens to these people who have received pituitary hormones. Although this is not due to CSL, some people have received corneal graphs and some people have received other products&mdash;and I will mention that again in a moment&mdash;and subsequently, many years later, developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We do not know what happens in that latency period. Nonetheless, when the small number of people who then go on to develop this disease do so, that disease is rapidly fatal. There is no cure and no treatment for it. It is a rapid, neurologically brain destroying disease which leads to death, usually within the course of some months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put evidence before the Senate that, in relation to the preparation of this product, the Commonwealth department of health was warned not to go ahead with the preparation of these hormones. It was warned not to go ahead with the preparation of these hormones because there was a long history of what at that stage were known as slow virus diseases. Some of these diseases were present in sheep. At about the time or shortly before the time CSL began the preparation of these hormones, the processes of kuru, a disease in Papua New Guinea, had been well worked out and understood. The danger that similar agents may exist which could be transmitted through tissue, particularly tissue closely associated with the brain such as pituitary tissue, was clearly evident by the early 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this place, it was also known that those agents were remarkably resistant to most of the sterilising agents available. Very often one sterilises these agents by adding formalin. Sometimes one sterilises them by judiciously heating them to a certain temperature. In both those cases it was known that these infective agents, whatever they were&mdash;we did not understand at that stage exactly what they were&mdash;were remarkably resistant to those agents and it would be extremely difficult to ensure the sterility of the material going into the preparation of the hormones or indeed, after the preparation, the sterility of the material before it was dispensed for patient use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, we find again that pituitary glands were collected from a wide variety of sources. Pituitary glands were not only collected in Australia; they were collected from Papua New Guinea. I have put evidence before the chamber that some of those pituitary glands were actually putrid. They were physically infected with bacteria, yet they went into batches for the preparation of these hormones. That was an atrocious practice to carry on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have produced evidence to the Senate that the separation of these hormones was carried out by chromatographic method. It was known that these agents eluted from chromatographic columns before the hormones came out. In other words, every fraction&mdash;whether it be the growth hormone; whether it be the two fertility hormones which were of interest in the preparation of these materials&mdash;which came out after that separation, after that initial elution from the chromatography column, would be infected with those agents if those agents were present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again for that reason, senior scientists went to the Commonwealth department of health and said, `This is too dangerous. Do not go ahead with this preparation.' Yet, the Commonwealth department of health instructed CSL and CSL went ahead with the preparation of these agents. The consequences we now know: five people have died from CJD. We know it is a disease with a long latency. We have no idea how many more people will die between now and possibly 2005-2015, whenever the latency period runs out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the preparation of the hormones, I have produced extensive evidence which again is based on the information which has come to me from scientists who want the opportunity to come forward and under parliamentary privilege put evidence into the formal record that CSL did not develop a code of good manufacturing practice, which would have required that the whole process of manufacture&mdash;from the selection of the material which went in to the detail of the processes, including the sterility, the packaging and the distribution of the product&mdash;be worked out, codified, written down and independently monitored, checked and signed off before the first preparation of these hormones began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find? We find that in CSL's case, throughout the whole 20 years it developed no code of good manufacturing practice. It continued to change the method of manufacture. It put experimental batches out into the community. It put out infected batches&mdash;now grossly infected with bacteria. It put out batches in which the ampoules of the hormones were not even sealed. It had no control over the efficacy, the potency or any of those things which related to a code of good manufacturing practice. This was developed only at the very tail end of the program, just before the program ceased to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that material needs to be put before a Senate inquiry. It is quite unconscionable to expect that these people, the scientists and those concerned&mdash;there are many seeking to take legal action against CSL and the Commonwealth&mdash;should have to go into an adversarial situation with those very heavy legal costs and heavy legal arguments against them to establish that basic data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the arguments that may well be presented is that it might be damaging to CSL to have this information come out in this way. Whether this Senate inquiry occurs or not, this information is going to get into the public domain. The question of whether this knowledge becomes public is not at issue. The question is simply when and by what route&mdash;whether it is going to be by a fair, inquisitorial and non-adversarial route or whether it is going to be by the unfair and adversarial route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the sale of CSL, the government provided an indemnity to CSL in relation to certain of its past practices. I have put before the Senate that CSL officers have actually come to my office in Adelaide and attempted to dissuade me from going down the course which I am now pursuing. In the course of that interview, I asked in some detail about the extensiveness of those indemnities provided by government. They said to me that, while the indemnities given at the time of the sale of CSL were not fully comprehensive, nonetheless there was an indemnity given to CSL in 1985 and that that indemnity continued to obtain. When I asked the senior executive officer of CSL if I could have a copy of that indemnity, he did not provide it to me, claiming that it was commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that situation also extremely alarming and worrying. Firstly, I would have thought that an indemnity which potentially involved the public in a very considerable amount of expense should be in the public domain. Secondly, I wonder very much about the legality of an indemnity given to a wholly owned government instrument, as it was in 1985, then carrying forward to what is now a totally differently constructed organisation, now in private ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If either government or opposition, particularly opposition, is concerned on the question of indemnity, I simply point out that if those indemnities are indeed valid, if those indemnities are comprehensive, then of course CSL has nothing to fear from the disclosure of this information. I point out again that it will be the government that will have to pick up the tab anyway, one way or another. I suggest that if those indemnities are not comprehensive the government will have to provide another indemnity for CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that interview with several of the CSL officers I was also told that, in relation to albumin, one of the blood products which CSL makes, there was no risk&mdash;and this came up when I asked them why they did not make the semi-synthetic factor 8 for haemophilia sufferers. They said, `Well, even if you make this, certainly the factor 8 is not likely to be infected, but we then mix it with albumin so it might be infected.' CSL said to me&mdash;and this was only several months ago&mdash;that albumin was, indeed, a completely safe product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have learned that recently a liver transplant was conducted, I believe in France, in which the patient subsequently received a preparation of concentrated albumin&mdash;this is a plasma expander which is used frequently in surgery. It was subsequently found that the person who had donated the albumin, or one of the people who had contributed to that albumin, died subsequently of CJD; and the person who had received the albumin also died of CJD. The natural background incidence of CJD is only one in a million people. So the odds of that occurring by chance alone are extremely remote. Almost certainly the recipient developed the CJD as a direct consequence of the preparation of albumin which he had received from a person who was infected with CJD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this lies in the fact that recently we have seen in Canada the withdrawal on two occasions of very large amounts of blood products, because it has been subsequently found that one of the contributors to those blood products had developed CJD. So this whole issue goes well beyond the past in relation to the risks associated with blood products, or with pituitary hormones, and extends very much into the future and the way in which we continue to prepare these sorts of products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what we find again, when we look back to CSL&mdash;and this is also related to the inquiry&mdash;is that some of the officers, some of the scientists within CSL who were associated with that long period of the preparation of pituitary hormones are still there in CSL in senior positions. One must doubt very much whether those people are competent and whether those people can be trusted to continue to make products which will be safe for the Australian public. So it has a prospective element to it as well. I see that my time has expired, so I will complete my comments in my concluding remarks. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is fair to explain our reasons for not supporting his reference, because it is a very complex problem. I also think it would be useful if I went over the history of this issue, in part. Then, when it appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> or if anybody is listening to this broadcast, they will understand its background. We have heard one side of the issue and it is only fair, both to listeners and to Senator Coulter, to explain in detail why the opposition is not supporting this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Serum Laboratory was established by the government in 1916 to help with the pharmaceutical needs of an isolated nation then at war. Following an approach from the endocrine society, CSL in 1964 became involved in the preparation of hormones derived from pituitary glands removed at the time of autopsy. Between 1965 and 1985 over 170,000 pituitary glands were collected by CSL&mdash;approximately 8,500 glands each year, mostly from public hospitals. A total of 2,100 people received pituitary hormone treatment&mdash;1,400 for infertility and 700 for short stature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention at this stage that Senator Coulter has made no reference whatsoever to the enormous benefit that accrued to those people who had infertility problems or children with short stature. He has not even mentioned one word in that regard. But, to go back to that era, it was a major breakthrough in the management of these people and it was worldwide. Australia was not in isolation in this regard; it was a worldwide development. That was in 1965 to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until 1971 that the issue of the danger of unconventional slow viral infections transmitted by hormones from collected glands was raised. The first suspected case of person-to-person transmission of CJD was not reported until 1974. The first case of CJD in a pituitary hormone recipient in Australia was not reported until 1988. So the first report did not occur here until 1988. CJD, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is a rare and fatal brain disease. The program was then suspended in 1985 and gland collection ceased in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently a study was undertaken to track down the recipients, using Medicare, electoral and Department of Social Security records as well as contacting the last known treating medical practitioner. Eighty-eight per cent of recipients have been traced. Bear in mind that it was unknown at that time what was going to occur. To date, five cases of CJD in hormone recipients have been reported. It should also be borne in mind that CJD does occur sporadically and there are in fact some familial patients. Eighteen people die of CJD each year in this regard&mdash;not hormone recipients, but due to those other factors. The disease is characterised by long incubation periods measured in years and decades, and it is fatal. The average incubation time is 12 to 15 years&mdash;longer than AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This research and development was supported by the endocrine society and it, in turn, was supported by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the Royal Australian College of Physicians and the AMA. So it is all very well to say that scientists were opposing it, speaking in retrospect. But, if we go back to the era when that was developed, every scientific body of any stature in this country supported the development of this program. It is all very well to go back with a `retrospectiscope' and make allegations; but at the time this program was developed every scientific body supported it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1993 the government commissioned an inquiry into the use of pituitary derived hormones in Australia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The inquiry was conducted by Professor Margaret Allars of the Faculty of Law, Sydney University, and the report was tabled in parliament on 9 June 1994. CSL became a public company in June 1994 and the government gave an indemnity regarding past actions. I have been in touch with CSL. They state and have produced evidence to support that they have received an indemnity from the government. I have spoken to the department and they, in turn, have said that an indemnity has been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has already settled compensation claims by the families of women who have died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease following administration of hormone products. Again, if I can digress a little to explain it a bit more fully: CJD belongs to a group of transmissible neurodegenerative diseases called unconventional slow viruses or spongiform encephalopathies. Human diseases in this group include diseases apart from CJD. There is Kuru, as Senator Coulter has mentioned, in New Guinea; Gerstmamm-Staussler syndrome; and fatal familial insomnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other diseases in this group actually affect animals. They include scrapie occurring in sheep and goats; transmissible mink encephalopathy occurring in mink; chronic wasting disease occurring in mules, deer and elk; bovine spongiform encephalopathy occurring in cattle; and feline spongiform encephalopathy occurring in cats. I mention all that just to give you the broad spectrum of the fact that we are not just dealing with the disease of humans; we are dealing with an extremely complicated disease where the cause is unknown. It is not as if there is a known cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group of diseases has a number of unique characteristics. Firstly, they are both infections and genetic, as I mentioned. Secondly, they do not cause a detectable immune repose characteristic of conventional viral infections. In other words, there is no test that you can get done to see whether this disease is present or not. Thirdly, they are associated with the presence of abnormal forms of a protein found in its normal form in most organs and cells of the body. That is why this protein is called a prion protein. Nobody is too sure what it is, in fact. Other distinctive characteristics include long incubation periods measured in years and decades and a high resistance to chemical inactivation. The disease is fatal. I mention the chemical inactivation aspect because initially it was thought that formalin inactivation was sufficient, but this prion protein even escapes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information about the link between CJD and pituitary hormone therapy was first conveyed to the Commonwealth department of health by Professor Raiti of the United States National Pituitary Agency. Interestingly enough, Sam Raiti is a Queensland graduate in medicine who graduated with me in 1956 and who subsequently went to the US. I have spoken to him about this matter. He conveyed that information back to Australia at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got a situation in which this disease not only is conveyed by some extraordinary fashion through the blood products but also can be transmitted by transplantation. In Germany, it was first found that a product was produced where people had serious head injuries and the dura mater, which covers the brain, was defective after a head injury and had to be replaced. Dura mater transplants were used to cover these defects. It was found many years later that some of these dura mater transplant people also developed CJD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> CJD, as I mentioned, is a worldwide problem. The other aspect that needs to be considered is that nobody knows whether these 2,100 people with pituitary hormones who have had blood transfusions might be transmitting this prion protein by being a blood donor. We just do not know. We are not going to know because there is nothing available to us at the moment to determine whether or not 10, 15 or 20 years down the track somebody who has had pituitary hormone may have got this prion protein in their blood and then transmitted it to an unwitting recipient further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That might sound horrific, but when this scare occurred in Canada&mdash;this is the problem associated with an inquiry of this nature&mdash;they had to recall and destroy half the blood products of Canada. The ramifications of this are of immense proportions when you consider that we have to weigh the public good in the overall situation against the likely benefit by a retrospective inquiry into a disease of which we still do not know to this day the scientific basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another very major aspect in relation to this&mdash;that is, the litigation problem. As Senator Coulter has mentioned, there are in excess of 120 stress claims pending in the Supreme Court of Victoria by former patients treated with human pituitary gonadotrophin and human growth hormones of pituitary origin. These claims are novel in that none of the plaintiffs has contracted the disease. We are talking about stress claims or claims in relation to having been the recipient of a treatment and, as Senator Coulter said, psychological aspects of the result of this treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to bring the whole of medicine and the whole treatment aspects into total disarray in this country, you start doing retrospective inquiries into what may or may not have occurred 30, 40 or 50 years ago and say that there are compensable claims. Professor Fiona Stanley, in the latest edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS>, wrote a very good article about litigation. Unfortunately, I do not have it with me or I would be pleased to read some excerpts from it. She said that there are certain things that occur. Because she is more involved in child health, it relates to children's diseases. She said that people have to accept that there are certain things that occur in relation to babies. For instance, a certain percentage of babies that are born with spasticity are part of the reproductive process and it has nothing to do with whether the babies are born by natural means or by caesarean section. The fact that miscarriages occur are part of the reproductive process and are not induced by trauma or other things in many respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking here at exciting a debate, if you like, which could have the ramifications of causing an absolute explosion in medical indemnity. We have no way of resolving this. As an aside, it has reached the stage where we have lawyers telling doctors how to treat some neurological diseases because cases have been taken to court. I think this could lead to an extension of the same nightmare that is occurring in some places in the world with regards to medical litigation, particularly in the USA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very valid reasons why the opposition sees no benefit in this inquiry. I understand that the government has addressed this.

It was very identifiable in that case&mdash;haemophiliacs developed AIDS as a result of the use of products, through no fault of their own or anybody's at that time, because the AIDS virus was not known to exist.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Coulter and Senator Herron have made very thoughtful and very informative contributions. I must say it is quite a change from what often goes on in this place. Senator Herron, I was watching the faces of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters as you read through those diseases and conditions. Not only <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but certainly the rest of us, would be very pleased to have a slightly slowed down description of Kuru, spongiform encephalopathies, et cetera. I am not sure that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> ever needs my assistance, but I was fascinated to note that. It would be of great assistance, because you brought together for the record some information that would be helpful for anybody who has an interest in this whole area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise the point that Senator Herron made, too&mdash;that while I also very much appreciate the point of view that Senator Coulter has put, he did not give the balanced view of how many other people have actually benefited from all those CSL products, not just the growth hormones or pituitary hormones but all the other products which have enabled a lot of people to enjoy a better quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this should take away from what Senator Coulter was saying regarding the significant percentage of people who have used products produced by the CSL. I am not wanting to say it is therefore proven that those products were causal, but to some extent that is a given, I think. It does not take away from the point you were making, but I do think it is better balanced by saying that these are very unfortunate things, we would prefer they did not happen, et cetera. But it is also important to say how many other people have benefited from CSL products&mdash;a point which Senator Herron made which needs to be reiterated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a very interesting journey. The CJD journey is probably the most interesting. I have actually found almost more to read about it in magazines like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scientist</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Yorker</EMPHASIS>, which is one of the best public health journals in the world. I do not know whether you know that, Senator Herron, but some of the best public health investigative journalism that I have read has occurred in the columns of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Yorker</EMPHASIS>. There are others, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this notion of seeing the connection between a disease that is affecting cows, sheep&mdash;cats, it seems, too&mdash;and humans. It is very mysterious. I suppose what we are looking at is this recognition now that it is probably not a viral transmission but a protein transmission. But we need to know of what sort, how it holds up and whether it is denatured by heat as opposed to not being denatured by chemical matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Coulter's contributions were very helpful in terms of the basic information that is needed in this area. That being said, the motion is opposed by the government&mdash;and I think Senator Coulter was clear about that. We do not feel, for many of the same reasons made by Senator Herron, that a committee inquiry is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters which Senator Coulter raised are largely historical. They go back to times when issues relating to CJD, HIV and hepatitis were not known or fully understood&mdash;although I suppose it would be best to say `particularly hepatitis C'. When the dangers caused by these diseases were recognised as a problem, appropriate action was taken by CSL and the Red Cross to minimise the risks involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues raised by Senator Coulter have already been extensively addressed in the hearing of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee held on 17 November 1994 and in the responses supplied by the department to questions raised at that hearing. The responses were published in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia enjoys access to extremely high quality plasma products which are prepared through the use of the latest technology and through codes of good manufacturing practice, which minimise the risks of the likelihood of viral transmissions. All of the latest standards for blood collection and the manufacture of plasma products have been introduced by the Red Cross and CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the hearings of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in November 1994, Senators Patterson and Lees tabled a series of extensive written questions relating to Catherine Beauchamp's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Alert: Is Regulation Working for Imported and CSL Blood Products</EMPHASIS>. Written answers to the questions were provided in February 1995 following lengthy consultation with the CSL and the Therapeutic Goods Administration and were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 February 1995. Senator Coulter has raised these concerns in recent speeches in the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatising of CSL was conducted by the assets sale task force in the Department of Finance. The task force acted with the advice of relevant and appropriately skilled consultants. The sale prospectus was duly authorised under the Corporations Law by the board of CSL Ltd. I am advised that the prospectus was pre-vetted under the Australian Securities Commission procedures. The Australian National Audit Office is in the concluding stages of an efficiency audit into the sale of CSL, and it would be appropriate to await its report before spending additional taxpayers' money on an inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following comments in response to Senator Coulter's points. The CSL has attempted to meet the high standards for the preparation of plasma products, vaccines and other biological products. The standards have changed over the years in the light of experience and have been introduced as required through the code of good manufacturing practice&mdash;GMP&mdash;and through adoption of the requirement to the British Pharmacopoeia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the implementation of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which came into effect through the therapeutic goods regulations on 15 February 1991, CSL has held a licence to manufacture therapeutic goods in accordance with the code of GMP&mdash;good manufacturing practice. CSL has been subject to a TGA audit and has been generally found to operate at an acceptable level of manufacture. When some audits have been rated as marginal, CSL has carried out the necessary action to bring the ratings to acceptable. CSL has not aided or frustrated the formulation of the code of GMP. CSL has not opposed inspections by TGA auditors or created any special problems for TGA within the overall process of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the implementation of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, CSL was treated like all other manufacturers and suppliers of therapeutic goods. The company did have a special relationship with the department prior to privatisation because it was indeed part of the department and, as a corporation, answered to the minister through the normal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL has a long history in manufacturing biological products in Australia. The company itself has possessed most of the expertise related to the products it has manufactured. Discussions have taken place between the department and the company over many issues relating to the quality, safety, efficacy and availability of products for the Australian market. There is no evidence that information was available to conclude that the manufacture of any product should not have been undertaken at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of experience, some products have been modified and some have been dropped from the product range. When discussions have taken place, there is no case known where advice has been ignored. There have been cases where products have been recalled from the market, but this has been the result of discussions and mutual agreement and is part of the overall drug regulation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to a number of conditions, the Commonwealth has provided a range of indemnities to CSL for pre-sale operations and they cover pituitary gland products, blood products derived from human placentas, AIDS-related claims, pertussis vaccine and asbestos-related claims. The indemnities do not apply to claims caused by, or arising from, a deliberate or reckless failure by CSL to comply with any statutory or common law requirements as the manufacturer of therapeutic products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point in the terms of reference refers to other matters. Neither the department nor I can comment about what that would particularly cover. While the contribution I have made on behalf of the government addresses somewhat different points from those raised by Senator Herron, I think together the points raised do make a very good defence for why government will not proceed with the inquiry at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I reiterate the importance of knowing. I think, as Senator Herron said, a retrospective judgment is very easy to make but it does not necessarily give us more truth or more accuracy. Particularly when you have diseases with such long lead times as CJD or HIV, I think historical backing up is particularly fraught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As those areas are covered by indemnity by government, I think it is important that we do not in any way create a situation of health care in this country where people would be afraid to provide health care or people would be afraid to accept it. I think Senator Coulter interjected on Senator Herron, `What people need to know is the risk.' I think most of us would agree that there is an important element of need to know, and as much as possible patients should be provided with that kind of information. But I am not at all sure how you would see the inquiry contributing to information being able to be provided to patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude my remarks by saying that, while the government is not minded to support this inquiry, I do strongly support the suggestion that people read Professor Fiona Stanley's article. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe that is an indication that, once the efficiency audit has taken place as a result of the sale, the government would be prepared to support an inquiry into this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate goes on over some time, senator. This woman, before she died, said that had she known of the risk she nonetheless would have gone ahead and received the hormones because to her having children, spending the first years of life with those children, was more important than her own life. I find that an extremely moving decision by that person. There may well have been other people in that same category who, had a risk been pointed out to them, would have decided to accept the risk. That is the important point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Linked with that, both you and the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) this morning have misled the Senate in a very important and significant way. Both of you have tried to imply that the knowledge that there was a risk associated with the preparation of these products was not available to the Commonwealth department of health, was not available to CSL, before it got into the process of preparation of these hormones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You yourself, Senator Herron, have pointed out that there are a wide range of similar agents that cause delayed neurological diseases which, when they finally appear in their active form, are rapidly fatal. Some affect humans, some affect a wide range of other animals. Knowledge of diseases of this general class began to appear in the 1930s, not in 1971. One such disease was scrapie in sheep. I want to restate some of the material that I have already read into the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1934-35 a vaccine prepared against another disease of sheep, louping ill, was used in the United kingdom to vaccinate sheep. The vaccine was prepared from the brains and spleens of sheep and was treated with formalin to sterilise it&mdash;a point that both of you have picked up&mdash;and to ensure that it did not transmit either this disease or indeed any other disease. This was and still is very largely a practice which is used in the preparation of vaccines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the sheep that received the vaccine were protected from louping ill&mdash;in other words, the efficacy of the vaccine was ensured&mdash;some 18 months to two years later they began to develop scrapie. In short, a vaccine which had been correctly prepared, in which the active agent had been successfully killed and which conferred proper immunity as intended, nonetheless transmitted another fatal neurological disease in an unexpected manner. I point out this was 1934-35. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1936 French research showed that scrapie could be transmitted from sheep to goats. Thus we have transmission between species. Thus, 30 years before CSL put human pituitary hormones prepared from human pituitary glands collected at autopsies into the marketplace, we began to collect knowledge of a class of infectious neurological diseases which were transmissible, which were caused by a presumed virus and in which the infectious particle was resistant to formalin&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>one of the most significant agents used in the preparation of products of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the disease kuru, which has also been mentioned earlier by me and Senator Herron, has afflicted some of the tribes in New Guinea. The work of Gadjusec and others in Australia in the late 1950s and early 1960s showed that this was also caused by what came to be known as a slow virus. Kuru was transmitted through the eating of human nervous tissue. It occurred among people who were cannibals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long latency between the eating of this material and the appearance of the symptoms, but once they appear there is a steady, inexorable progression of mental deterioration leading to death. Remember, this work was in the late 1950s and early 1960s, several years before CSL started to prepare its pituitary hormones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1958, Gadjusec was working on kuru in Australia. He visited England and saw some of the work on scrapie. He published work on kuru in 1959 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS>. By 1963, kuru was shown to be a transmissible disease, and the agent responsible for its transmission was shown to be resistant not only to formalin but to ultraviolet light, phenols and to autoclaving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, here we had knowledge, years before CSL got into the preparation of pituitary hormones, of a transmissible disease in humans that caused these neurological diseases after a latency period and which was resistant to all these commonly used agents. This knowledge did not come afterwards, it came well beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the work on kuru&mdash;this is highly significant&mdash;by Gadjusec was actually done in the CSL laboratories, and CSL scientists at the time must therefore have been well aware of the work going on with kuru, the infectious nature of the causative agent and the nature of the disease process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1966, CJD had been shown to be a transmissible disease and, by 1970, CJD had been transmitted in the laboratory to a range of other primates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June of 1963, CSL was asked, as Senator Herron said, to investigate the manufacture of pituitary hormones. These have been made on a small and experimental scale by individuals working out of university laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three of the many pituitary hormones were of particular interest: the growth hormone, the follicle stimulating hormone, and the luteinising hormone. The latter two are responsible for the formation and ripening of the Graafian or egg follicle in the ovary and the formation of the corpus luteum which maintains pregnancy&mdash;the fertility hormones. The use of these two had been shown to be effective in treating some cases of infertility in women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth hormone had been shown to be effective in stimulating the growth of stunted children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work at CSL was undertaken. The bulk production of these hormones involved the collection of pituitary glands from human cadavers, the making up a batch of such glands and the extraction of the hormones from these glands. As it turned out, some 1,300 glands were combined before the extraction process was applied. So if even one of these pituitary glands was infected with one of these agents, in our humble acceptance of our ignorance, we should have at that stage accepted the fact that there would be other agents yet to be discovered. </PARA>

I am saying that the people in CSL knew, and they were warned; and the people in the Commonwealth department of health knew, and they were warned. Thus, it was likely that the inclusion of a single gland which was infected with one of these slow virus agents would have infected the whole batch. Also, it would be essentially impossible to sterilise either the batch or any of the separated hormones. By the very nature of these agents, it would be impossible to tell whether any particular pituitary gland was infected.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another important point, because no care was taken by CSL in relation to the sources from which these pituitary glands were collected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there was enough knowledge; in fact, I do not even have to assert that. I will assert that, if this reference were put before the committee, a scientist would come forward and produce letters which he presented to the Commonwealth department of health, warning them not to go ahead with this preparation for all the reasons that I have mentioned: that there may well be an agent present; you would not know whether the agent was present; you would not be able to sterilise; and all the preparations which were made by this method would become infected if the agent were present and, therefore, there was the danger of transmitting one of these diseases. That is the very point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that even with that evidence, and CSL presenting the evidence of benefit, in a Senate situation or in a court situation, people might say, `Well, it was reasonable for CSL to go ahead under these circumstances.' But let the evidence be put on the table. Let it be put on the table in a Senate committee situation and not in this adversarial situation, where we will hear the eminent and expensive QCs for the government, for the Commonwealth department of health and for CSL defending against these individuals who feel so much threatened by the impact that these diseases may have on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in another important respect the minister has misled the Senate this morning. She talked about the TGA. The TGA did not even come into existence until long after the episode with the preparation of pituitary hormones.

Professor Allars reported, as I said in the Senate on 10 May 1995, that the terms of reference of her inquiry did not allow her to examine CSL's product liability, and information in CSL's material therefore could not be properly assessed. The point is that the terms of reference of the Allars inquiry were such that there were many matters&mdash;I have gone into considerable detail in relation to these&mdash;regarding the code of good manufacturing practice, or the failure of the code of good manufacturing practice, which Professor Allars could not go into, did not go into and did not report upon.

Therefore, the Allars inquiry is not entirely relevant to what we are discussing this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that when some months ago I attempted to get this inquiry into place, I was told by various members of the opposition that the person I should speak to is Dr Michael Wooldridge, the shadow minister for health.

I would like you to tell me exactly why you want this inquiry.' So I spent about three-quarters of an hour with Dr Wooldridge running through in considerable detail much of the material that I have run through this morning. His response to me in relation to a Senate inquiry on this matter was&mdash;I think I am quoting him quite fairly and accurately&mdash;that, if CSL were still in public ownership, he would have no qualms whatsoever about having a Senate inquiry but now that CSL is in private hands he is very worried about the share price of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what lies behind the opposition's opposition to this reference. Dr Wooldridge is the pretender to the ministry of health, and here he is placing a higher priority on the share price of CSL than he is on the health and the welfare of the people of Australia.

Dr Wooldridge is quite capable in that other place of standing up, if he wishes to, and making a personal explanation to put that also into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: Senator Coulter recounted a conversation, but then subsequently said that this was the reason the opposition was opposing. I refute that completely.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Teague)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;On the point of order: I listened most carefully because there was certainly at least danger that a member of another chamber of this parliament, the House of Representatives, was being reflected upon in the words that you were including in your speech, Senator Coulter. The last point Senator Herron made is not strictly a point of order. He was making a clarification of the opposition's position, refuting what you said, and he has the right to stand at the end of your speech to make that brief addition or clarification. However, I did feel that the words you were using, from a private conversation, were imputing motives to a member of another house. I would simply ask you, Senator Coulter, to clarify that you are not imputing motives to a member of another house. Then I would ask you to continue your speech. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not imputing motives to a member of another house. I will move on, then, and deal with this issue of the share price of CSL as an issue in its own right. If the indemnities which have been given to CSL are indeed comprehensive and robust, then there need be no worry. It will not affect the share price of CSL for the simple reason that all CSL and the government have to do is say, `Indemnities are in place. Whatever the costs are, the government is going to pick up the tab. CSL does not have to pick up any of this cost whatsoever.' Consequently, the share price will not be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, the indemnities could be inadequate&mdash;I believe that they may well be inadequate, and this is one of the other things the Senate inquiry could tease out because I have been prevented from seeing those claimed 1985 indemnity documents&mdash;and the share price starts to fall, as they well might do, then of course the government would have to very quickly ensure that those indemnities were modified and fresh indemnities given to CSL which would in fact cover it completely for any claims which go back to that earlier period when CSL was in public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting aspect of this is something the minister said when she pointed out quite correctly that CSL would not be covered, even under the indemnities, for any recklessness on its behalf in the preparation of its products. What I have said this morning, what scientists would say if they could come before this Senate committee that I am attempting to establish, and what scientists will probably say in the courts is that CSL was indeed reckless and did not observe proper standards of behaviour as scientists working in laboratories in relation to the sterility of their equipment, to mention another thing. Between batches they evidently did not sterilise their chromatography columns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, there may well be an effect on the share price of CSL. It may well be that CSL is not covered under its indemnity, nor could it be covered under its  indemnity. That bears very much on the issue Senator Margetts has raised in relation to privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say that this is not a matter of whether this information comes out; it is simply a matter of how and when this information comes out. I believe that it is absolutely unconscionable, and I repeat, unconscionable, for this Senate to ignore the wishes of such a large number of people&mdash;over 600 of them around Australia just in the CJD support groups alone&mdash;who want this inquiry up, and that it should force those people to go into the threatening, adversarial environment of the courts, against very powerful forces, to establish that they have a legitimate claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude where I began: this is pre-eminently an issue that should come before a Senate inquiry; it is not an issue that should go first to the courts. It may well go to the courts afterwards, but it is pre-eminently an issue that is appropriate and correct for a Senate committee to inquire into. I would urge the Senate to support this reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Austudy Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1995 No. 132 and made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations to which I refer are those which the government formulated and gazetted on 8 June 1995. These regulations may represent&mdash;I say this quite deliberately&mdash;a new additional total expenditure and savings means test for Australia's social security system. Under this regulation, Austudy benefits are to be withdrawn from students in self-employed families unless the parents pass a new means test on their total expenditure and savings as well as on their income and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new expenditure means test includes benefits received from relatives. No other group in the community is subject to such a means test. The government has brought in these regulations with a commendable objective in mind with which I believe no-one has any disagreement, and that is to overcome rorts in the Austudy area. No-one questions the stopping of welfare abuses, but families who are paying full Australian tax have a right to feel abused if their children are denied equal access to benefits for which they are paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also unclear why the self-employed should be subject to a new means test on total expenditure and savings by a government which at the last election opposed expenditure taxation as it felt it was unfair. That is rather ironic, I would have thought. Will the government apply the same treatment to other pensions and benefits? If gifts from relatives are to be counted as a recipient family's means, why is the government double-dipping by not allowing income tax deductions to relatives making such gifts, and I will come back to that issue in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By all means, let us have a debate about proper targeting of social payments, but change should be consistent, fair and equitable. If the government is saying that there will be a social wage compensation for higher taxes on families, let us hear now whether it intends to extend the new expenditure and savings means test. Will mothers in families with a self-employed spouse or those receiving a bequest under a parent's will be subject to the additional expenditure and savings means test on their family payments or on their home child-care allowance? Will every pensioner receiving gifts from adult children be deemed out of his or her pension? These are issues which the government must answer. Obviously, they extend beyond the portfolio with which we are dealing now&mdash;the narrow area of Austudy. In the time that I have been here very often a precedent has been established and then it is referred to and the precedent is used in other areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So this is a political point?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. I am worried about the possibility of this being the thin end of the wedge. These Austudy regulations are an enormous precedent for the whole area of social expenditure. The government must be challenged to declare its intentions. If it admits that it would not be fair to apply the new additional expenditure and savings means test to all families and to all social benefits, let it explain why it is selectively attacking one class of families receiving Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to some of the particularities that require specific answers from the government. The new designated parents for the purposes of these regulations are defined in regulation 12L of the Austudy regulations. Regulation 12L(1)(a) includes business migrants and regulation 12L(1)(b) includes persons who have an interest in an asset located outside Australia or a proprietary company or an unlisted public company or a trust. I notice that in a speech on the matters of public interest debate on 20 September Senator Baume had something to say about what that could encompass. I will not refer to those because, no doubt, he will do so in his submission to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A trust could cover a wide range of persons. It could cover persons who are PAYE taxpayers and people who are on wages and salaries. Theoretically, every worker has an interest in a trust. Superannuation funds are trusts. It is all right for the government to say, `They are not meant to be covered', but as far as I can see, they are. It is not what the desire of the government is; it is what is included in law. Once these regulations become law, they will be treated as such by the persons who may be disadvantaged by them or by an interpretation of them. These are the things that we have to come to grips with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation states that a designated parent derives income from a source outside Australia and is a self-employed person or is a partner in a partnership. So the self-employed are being targeted. I heard Senator Boswell, on behalf of the National Party&mdash;I think it was on behalf of the opposition&mdash;yesterday or the day before, waxing quite eloquently. I enjoyed his speech. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bell" NAMEID="7U4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And enthusiastically. He was absolutely right about what he was saying. He was saying the government was discriminating, in the other area which he was talking about, against the self-employed, against all of those people in country towns. I think he mentioned people selling tractors, the automobile industry, the small businesses, the small emporiums and so forth in country towns&mdash;self-employed people. These people are going to be disadvantaged and discriminated against by these regulations, except, as it says in 12L(1)(d):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (except a primary producer to whom subregulation 19(2) applies).</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the government, in a political decision, exempts primary producers. They are a powerful lobby group. I believe they should not be included in this new expenditure and savings means test. But here we have, under the regulations, in one rural community, the self-employed, who happen to be selling a tractor to the farmer, covered by the strictures of these regulations, while the farmer is not. It would be interesting to hear the government's explanation for that apparent discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government: do they think farmers are so stupid that they do not realise that once you get this through for the self-employed, even though you exempt farmers on this occasion, you will grab them in the next round? They are not silly enough that they cannot see the writing on the wall.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to raise is this whole question of 12N, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of subregulation 12K(1), the actual means of a designated parent for the period of eligibility are taken to be the total expenditure and savings made in that period by the parent and his or her family.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very broad definition of expenditure and savings. I know the government intends it to be limited to domestic expenditure but it is not defined as such. It is not limited to domestic expenditure. The government must be clear and have these regulations say precisely what are the total expenditure and savings they mean. At present it appears to be unlimited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does this mean that the self-employed are to be tested on gross income, with no allowance for tax deductible expenditure, which represents a cost of earning income? What happens if family A and family B make gifts to each other? Do those gifts get counted as means of both families, though neither family is net better off?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next subparagraph, 12N(3), states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Secretary reasonably believes that a transaction engaged in by a person, other than the parent or a member of his or her family, is a transaction engaged in for the benefit of the parent or a member of his or her family, the Secretary must impute a value to the transaction, for the purpose of this regulation, that the Secretary considers to be the fair market value, as if the parent or member of his or her family had expended the amount.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two things about that clause and about 12N as a whole. Gifts by a grandparent of a self-employed family will be covered. If a grandparent gives money for education or whatever to the son or the daughter of a self-employed person, that would be taken into account for the purpose of assessment as part of that designated parent's total expenditure and saving; but only if that designated parent is self-employed, not if the designated parent was a farmer or a PAYE taxpayer. Why that discrimination? Don't you see the ludicrous nature of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happens quite frequently that a grandparent is taxed on that part of the income which he or she is transferring to the family for the education of the children. They are taxed there. That is going to be taken into account and virtually taxed, for the purpose of Austudy, against the designated parent. The grandparent cannot claim that as a taxation deduction. That is the government double dipping. If you are going to acknowledge transfers for one particular purpose adverse to the recipient you should give a concessional benefit to the person making the donation. You cannot have it both ways. I know that is a more fundamental matter than the narrow Austudy area, but it is very vital. It is a matter, I believe, of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is that families are not treated logically or fairly. If a payment is to be regarded as a particular person's means or income&mdash;in this case, the designated parent&mdash;then the donor should not be taxed or income tested on that particular private income transfer. The transfer is within a particular family&mdash;an extended family, in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that the Social Security Act exempts family gifts&mdash;for example, from grandparents to families. If the new total expenditure and savings means test is right and proper for one class of family for one social welfare scheme, as the government is suggesting it is in this scheme, how long will it be before it is applied to all other pensions and benefits and all recipients of government payments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out one particular area. When it comes to regulations 12N(2) and (3), the ones I have been discussing, how is the secretary going to be able to exercise his statutory duty under those regulations to deem a market value for transactions when there are literally hundreds of millions of unrequited interfamily transactions each year? Take just one example: is the secretary going to assess the value of child care provided by grandparents for self-employed families with Austudy students? That is what it literally means. I am sure the government does not mean that, but that is what the Austudy regulations, as they are being discussed here, literally mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If grandparents are baby-sitting for the spouse of a self-employed person and that spouse wants to assist in the business, is that gift going to be assessed by the secretary? Will the secretary have to issue copious rulings like the tax office to declare what are acceptable birthday or Christmas gifts in the case of a designated parent who is self-employed? These are the sorts of things that the government needs to address. I think it is important for the Senate to exercise its power in this regard, because we do have a responsibility for seeing that regulations are fair, just and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, this regulation does not meet that test. I believe the government should withdraw the regulation and have another go at it. I am only one person in this chamber, but I feel quite strongly about that, particularly where I am coming from, because I believe the whole taxation system so far as families are concerned is quite discriminatory, in any event. I do not say that it is discriminating; it is discriminatory against families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Harradine, the opposition has quite a number of reservations about this particular measure before the chamber at the moment. Everyone, I believe, in this chamber would support the proper targeting of Austudy&mdash;people who receive this sort of benefit should be the people who are entitled to receive the benefit. But we have very grave concerns about the way in which the government is now proposing to determine that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, together with members of the government and the Democrats, held a major inquiry into Austudy earlier this year. Our report came out in June. This report was a result of our concerns in estimates hearings last year about the way in which Austudy is administered, and what is proposed today is another nightmare set of regulations which, we believe, may be impossible to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This department has a very poor record, in terms of the Ombudsman, in the way in which it goes about administering the regulations it already has under its jurisdiction. Last year there were seven major complaints to the Ombudsman about the way in which Austudy regulations were administered. Half the complaints about DEET to the Ombudsman were in relation to Austudy regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took evidence on these problems right round Australia. We did this because when we put the proposition to the head person in Austudy about the Ombudsman's report she said, `Well, that is just the Ombudsman's opinion. Who is the Ombudsman?' It was that sort of arrogance that we took exception to and that is the reason we set up the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having taken evidence right around the country on this matter, we then came up with 22 recommendations in this report for the tightening up of Austudy. One of those recommendations referred to this matter under consideration. We received quite a lot of anecdotal evidence about the rorting of Austudy and the inadequacy of the current way in which government determines whether people are eligible or ineligible through their tax arrangements. Much evidence was given to us&mdash;and I must say it was not scientific evidence; it was anecdotal evidence&mdash;that the Austudy system was being rorted under the current arrangements and certainly should be tightened up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had evidence given by quite a number of students in different parts of the country about this matter. We decided that we would make a recommendation that would tighten that up. One of those examples in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a boy that was in the same volleyball team as my son. His parents lived everywhere, travelled overseas. He was getting AUSTUDY and so was his brother; they both had units because their parents had bought them a unit. They both had cars. He was getting AUSTUDY and so was his brother.</PARA>
<PARA>Another example states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The one I teach with is married. They have a business; they have a second house that they rent, and she is getting AUSTUDY. I asked my students, just before I came on Friday, who was getting AUSTUDY. Of the ones getting AUSTUDY, each child's parents owned a business, and then the ones who were not getting it are the ones that are poor.</PARA>
<PARA>It was that sort of evidence that the government is responding to in this report. It is anecdotal. There is no suggestion and no studies have been done to prove that it is widespread. One fears that what the government is doing here yet again is taking an ant-sized problem and hitting it with a sledgehammer, with a set of regulations that are going to have horrendous compliance implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not like the way in which it was done under the current tax arrangements. We suggested that the government go away and try to come up with a new scheme so that people could arrange their affairs through the tax system and not get Austudy unfairly. I still believe that principle is quite sound but we have before us a proposal that I wonder how on earth people could comply with fairly. I wonder how on earth a government could actually administer such regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, there is one Austudy official for every 100 students on Austudy. The reason for that is the complexity of the regulations&mdash;the overpayments, the requirements to repay. The whole system really needs to be redesigned from scratch because it has grown in such a way that it has become an administrative nightmare. And what the government has proposed is yet another administrative nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the regulations, the government has come up with a notional parent with which actual parents are compared. A notional parent is someone on PAYE income. When they compare someone who is self-employed with the notional parent, if they are earning less than the notional figure, they are obviously entitled to Austudy. But to determine that, the government has come up with this rather harebrained scheme of actually measuring people's expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mind boggles as to how you are actually going to do that. Are you going to require people to bring in all their receipts from K-Mart and all their bankcard slips? Will everyone have to keep receipts of every item of expenditure? What if you pay cash and do not receive a receipt? Will you have to ask for a receipt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spent three study periods overseas as an academic under a scheme where you had to prove what you spent. So I actually had to do that but, fortunately, it was for only about three months. It used to take me an hour to an hour and a half every night recording expenditure in the right column, and checking the receipts. This government is now proposing that parents who are often very poor and who might not have a high level of education&mdash;they certainly will not be tax accountants and would not be able to afford to employ a tax accountant to do this for them&mdash;will have to keep every receipt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has actually ruined small business in this country because of its regulations and the compliance costs associated with them. Now it is going one better and is doing this to parents, to the ordinary people out there who really have much better things to do with their time than fill out a whole lot of forms for the government and keep records of a whole lot of receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to tighten up Austudy. We have a unanimous Senate report that says that we need to tighten up and target Austudy better and that we need to come up with another system than the one currently based on income tax. But when I looked at this proposal this morning I was absolutely horrified at the way in which the government is proposing to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal would be an incredibly costly exercise. It will take up a lot of the time of parents. Who is going to check all this? Will you have to employ another army of bureaucrats to check everyone's expenditure? As I mentioned earlier, there is already one public servant for every 100 Austudy recipients. What will this measure change that ratio to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to look at our report again, look at the 22 recommendations, and try to come up with a system that does not require people to understand such complex sets of regulations and does not take up their time and money in compliance. We need a system that is fair and equitable. The government has a very long way to go on this issue before it satisfies the parents and students who are entitled to Austudy and should be receiving it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anyone in this chamber would deny that there is evidence, a lot of it anecdotal, that Austudy is being rorted. People who are well-off have been able to cheat the system to the disadvantage of taxpayers of Australia and to the anger of many people who have honestly stated what their income is, on the basis of their tax returns and taxable income, and have failed to get Austudy for their children, yet see their neighbours' children going off to whatever educational institution and receiving Austudy unfairly while they do not&mdash;unfairly as a result of cheating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Minister Free) said that he was going to introduce regulations that were aimed at stopping families `with complex company or other financial structures'&mdash;they were his words&mdash;from rorting the system. If that is the objective, surely we have to look at the gap, the horrendous gap, between the objective and what the bureaucracy has provided him with as the answer. This is the test of good government. The test of good government is that, when you set out to resolve a problem, you can tell whether the advice you get from the bureaucracy is self-serving, incompetent or meeting an agenda which, frankly, is not acceptable&mdash;which is what this government has done in this case&mdash;or, if you are an effective and efficient government, sorting the wheat from the chaff in terms of advice and doing what is right and sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been here too long. It does not know the difference between wheat and chaff&mdash;that is one option&mdash;or it, in fact, shares the agenda of the bureaucracy that provided this empire building answer, a wrong and offensive answer, to this problem. Once again, this answer is aimed at belting small business, little family partnerships, the battlers in the independent area, particularly those at the lower end of the scale and those who send their children to Catholic systemic schools, which is the major element of the non-state system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seems to me to be aimed against people who are least able to protect themselves. They are the people&mdash;many of whom have lost their jobs in `the recession we had to have'&mdash;who have started off independently, struggling to run their own businesses, their own little partnerships. It might be a house cleaning partnership, husband and wife; it might be a lawn mowing partnership. If you are in a partnership, you get donged by this mallet&mdash;this incredible imposition by this government&mdash;because it has accepted without question advice of an empire building bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In future, instead of the simple system we had in the past&mdash;which was being rorted, and I acknowledge that up-front&mdash;where, if you are a PAYE earner, you have clear, evident taxable income and so on and you can see what it is, a new hoop has to be jumped through by anyone&mdash;and I read from section 12L&mdash;`who has an interest in an asset'&mdash;it does not matter what size&mdash;`located outside Australia and its external territories'. That may well be properly aimed at many migrants, particularly business migrants who have perhaps come to Australia and have hidden assets overseas or assets overseas which really indicate that they are much better off than maybe the local situation indicates. How you fix that is a matter that we can, once again, examine if we have a proper examination of it, but there has been no proper examination so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse, this section mentions anyone who has an interest&mdash;no matter how large&mdash;in a proprietary company. How many families have proprietary companies&mdash;particularly little family businesses like corner stores&mdash;for the purpose of having limited liability? Having a proprietary company is no indication of wealth&mdash;none at all. Some proprietary companies are owned by wealthy people and so on, but having a proprietary company is, of itself, no indication of wealth and no cause in itself for forcing people to jump through these new hoops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine has mentioned what I mentioned the other day, and that is this section mentions anyone who has an interest, no matter how big or small, in a trust or a similar arrangement. As Senator Harradine pointed out, superannuation funds are effectively trusts, and that is obviously a nonsense. The section also mentions anyone who `derives income from a source outside Australia'. I think that is an issue that is worthy of detailed examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But how about this: this section also mentions anyone who `is a self-employed person except a primary producer'. There are so many self-employed persons. For example, many truck drivers are self-employed persons. Are these some kind of new elite that have to be clobbered by this government? I find this absolutely incredible. As I said, there is no suggestion that these self-employed people should be rich. Even worse, there is no requirement whatsoever that the objectives that the minister stated&mdash;that is, having a complex company or other financial structure&mdash;should be met. Is being self-employed a complex financial structure? What bureaucrat dreamt up this response to the minister's proper concerns?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section also mentions `a partner in a partnership'&mdash;for example, a husband and wife in partnership in a cleaning business. They are rich, terrible people. They have to be hassled. They have to be made to jump through these new hoops that Senator Tierney outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very substantial volume of expense, both in time and money, will be involved in people making application in the future. Imagine the cost of compliance is this area&mdash;an area where this government has adopted one of the most arrogant possible approaches we could see. As long as the cost of compliance is not too large to the government, it does not matter what the cost of compliance is to the Australian citizen, particularly if he or she is a small business person, is self-employed, is in a partnership or is, in fact, not in the great Labor mafia, if you like, of a trade union, where they would be part of the trade union and often big business and big government organisations, which can happily speak to each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are on the outer in Australia under this government are people like the self-employed, those in partnerships and those who might have a little family company. They are the people who are the enemy, apparently, of this government. They are certainly the enemy in relation to these regulations. These regulations are aimed at these battlers in Australia, many of whom have become self-employed because their employment was terminated under the recession we had to have&mdash;Mr Keating's recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at this and say, `Okay. The government has a problem. It has set out to resolve it in the wrong way,' but let us recognise this: there is no discretion in these regulations. If you have an interest in, you are classed to be a designated parent and the designated parent has to, with no qualifications, jump through this additional hoop. I would not be in favour of providing legislation or regulations where there is discretion if it is possible to do it in another way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever you have discretion you have uncertainty, and uncertainty before the law is one of the worst elements of the law. But the lack of discretion here makes it intolerable. In other words, should we not look for a better way of solving the problem than the self-serving, empire building way that the bureaucracy has managed to con past this government? I would suggest that there are better ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking expenditure, of itself, can be totally misleading. Expenditure can mean lots of things. Under the tax act, for example, you are allowed to depreciate capital items you buy. In other words, a partnership involved in house cleaning might outlay a couple of thousand dollars on a hot-shot vacuum cleaner, but that can be depreciated in terms of diminishing income over some years&mdash;say, five years or whatever the life of the thing is under depreciation arrangements. In other words, it does not count as a lump expenditure in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in these regulations which applies the same sort of concept. Under this, expenditure is expenditure is expenditure. We have to establish just what it means. There is nothing in these regulations to do so. In other words, you are going to be worse off because of the interpretation of expenditure here than if you had the normal tax application of this concept applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, on almost every ground, the way the government has been advised&mdash;it has accepted that advice&mdash;to resolve this problem is the wrong way. How shall we do it better? I mentioned the tax act a minute ago. This raises an interesting question. Who are the government really targeting? Are they really targeting whom the minister says they are targeting; that is, those people who have rorted the system, who have relied on complex company and other financial structures improperly to get Austudy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the ways they could really target them. I mentioned the tax act. Section 260 of the tax act has a system where it says, basically, that anyone who is involved in an artificial structure aimed at getting a tax benefit to which they should not be entitled should have that benefit put aside and in fact would be subject to penalties. In other words, they are targeting people who have complex company or other financial structures that have, as a result, a benefit going to the person who set them up to which they would otherwise not be entitled. In other words, it is aimed specifically at the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to argue whether section 260 necessarily works properly in all cases. In fact, at one stage the High Court appeared to be of the view that section 260 was dead; it has now taken the contrary view and said that it is alive. But the fact is that section 260 provides the sort of approach that concentrates on people who are rorting the system, instead of belting everyone, including the honest people, the great bulk of honest people who are not rorting the Austudy system but who get belted anyway. And for what reasons do they get belted? They get belted because they are in a partnership, or because they have a proprietary company, or because they are self-employed. That is why they get belted under this system&mdash;not because they have been targeted as having some complex company or other financial structure. If, in fact, there are rorting arrangements going on, how about the government coming back to us with a system aimed at that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received no evidence whatsoever and nothing by way of explanatory memorandum from this government to demonstrate that there has been rorting of an enormous volume by a self-employed person, or a partner in a partnership, or someone owning a proprietary company. Firstly, we have not seen the evidence. Secondly, we have not seen why rorters could not be targeted by the sort of specific targeting legislation that the Tax Act provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that a similar prohibition&mdash;a prohibition on taking advantage of arrangements which have as a purpose the minimising of income for benefit purposes&mdash;is the direction in which we should be looking. Also, we should be looking at imposing penalties, as the tax act does, for breaching this arrangement, for entering into crooked deals because that would provide a serious deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present system we do not have a deterrent, except in the sense that we are putting off people who are probably entitled to a benefit from applying in the first place. By having the sort of deterrent of targeting, as section 260 does, you would be providing a deterrent to cheats; whereas, under the present system, the government is providing a massive deterrent to honest Australians simply by making it so much harder for them to jump through the hoop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these regulations fail hopelessly on almost every score, except that&mdash;and this might sound ridiculous&mdash;they will work. They will work because of their unfair impact on honest, decent Australians whose families are entitled to the support of Austudy. They will work because of their added need for bureaucracy to ensure they work&mdash;in other words, a greater inefficiency in the delivery of a benefit. And they will work in a way that is to the detriment of Australia. What we have to find is a system that will work to the benefit of Australians, particularly those battlers who are at the bottom end of the income scale and yet who are caught up in this rough-house approach of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that there is another agenda, indeed, involved in this. If it is the view that there are too many people attending schools in the private school system who are receiving Austudy, and that attending a private school is evidence of the richness of a family, I would say that is just disgraceful nonsense that clearly has an agenda which I find totally unacceptable. There are many families in Australia who sacrifice themselves enormously because they want to send their child or children to the non-state school system. Whether that judgment is right or wrong is beside the point. The fact is, they do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Harradine would know, many of them do it because they have other social imperatives. Many people feel the need to send their children to the Catholic systemic system, for example, which one could hardly ever accuse of being a rich system. In fact, I think most studies I have seen recently indicate that, in terms of class sizes and resources, the Catholic systemic system is under-resourced, as against most state systems. If that is one of the criteria being used to justify this kind of broad hit at people who are self-employed, then it is an appalling one. Unless there is clear evidence to indicate why this kind of approach should be followed by the government, and none has been presented, then in my view this should be totally reviewed. There is no need for massive urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the regulations are supposed to come into force on 1 October; but they come into force on 1 October in relation to a year that begins, I think, on 1 January 1996. I understand that there would be a need to get forms printed and so on some time in advance. But I say to the government that there is no way I would find it acceptable that this kind of regulation, which goes so far beyond the statement of the minister, should be allowed to rush through&mdash;although it has certainly met the requirements of the parliament in terms of how long it should be before the parliament&mdash;without these very serious matters that have been raised here being adequately responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress: it is no good for the minister or the bureaucracy to say, `Just because you're categorised as a designated parent doesn't mean you have to follow all these things.' I hate to tell you that unfortunately, under these regulations, it does. No matter how small your investment in a proprietary company is, no matter whether the trust you are in is a superannuation fund and therefore you have no control over it&mdash;it does not really indicate massive expenditure or any kind of, as I say, complex company or other financial structure&mdash;there is no discretion in the regulations. You have to do it. If you fail to do it, you suffer the consequences of apparently not being entitled to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wrongly trying to solve the serious problem by hammering, in this unfair way, those Australians who are low income earners but happen to be self-employed is totally unacceptable. I do not know how much of the $29 million a year savings are going to be at the expense of these low income earners. The government has not provided us with any kind of indication of the extent to which the $29 million is to be saved from, say, people who have assets overseas who are rorting the system that way. We have no indications from the government about where the $29 million a year will come from. This gap between what the minister said in his explanation and what is actually in the regulations, as I said the other day, is an absolute disgrace. The absence of explanation is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do regret that it has taken a fair while&mdash;in fact, I think it was the last day before this was moved, and I commend Senator Harradine for moving disallowance&mdash;but I would hope that out of this we can get some regulatory arrangements which do block off the people who are ripping off Austudy, because they have to be stopped. It is unfair and a disgrace that people are ripping off their neighbours, if you like, by getting Austudy to which they are not entitled. But because the objective is good does not mean that every action you take to achieve that objective is good. That is one of the lessons that maybe some elements of the bureaucracy here should understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations are an unfair attack on small business, the people at the lower end of the income scale in many instances, without honing in effectively and in a concentrated way on those people who are ripping off the system.

I assure them that the opposition would cooperate strongly in examining better ways of achieving what is an excellent objective&mdash;that is, protecting Austudy from rip-off.

I remind the Senate that recommendation 12 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That training in AUSTUDY for CES officers be substantially upgraded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this short debate I have heard with interest many senators suggesting that the increased complications by these regulations would be almost impossible to administer because the effect of this set of regulations would not be to resolve the problem of the abuse and rorting of Austudy. The result would be to abuse the families who are already contributing a proper amount of tax and who are trying to comply with the system as it is. That is what the effect would be. The danger, as mentioned by Senator Harradine, would be that the government will apply this concept to other pension and welfare recipients. We have no denial of that from the government. We have no indication that that is not what the intention is. If we had a government that was heading down that track, I wonder what the country is heading towards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, a lot of the problem in this area revolves around the unanswered question of what is an independent student. The failure of the government to adequately answer this question has led us to a situation which is quite ludicrous. Instead of actually answering that question and providing us with a commonsense measurement which can be endorsed by the community of what an independent student is, we have the families brought in in various measures of deeming what a family is, what a family contributes, what a family earns, how much they should contribute and where they ought to live. These sorts of immeasurable aspects have been brought into this debate and have complicated the regulations to such an extent that it is almost indecipherable to a normal person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this failure to recognise the reality of how families conduct themselves and how they relate in the real world which has led us to a bureaucratic maze. It is a maze that does not fit ordinary or normal families. In previous debates we were talking about independence and how old people had to be or how long they should have stayed away from home or how many months they were supposed to have been working before they could truly be defined as independent. I recall bringing to this chamber the great revelation that my mother, for example, bought my underpants until I was 35. I think quite a number of males in Australian society rely on their mothers to continue supporting them in certain ways. My grandmother bought my pyjamas until I was 40. It is only recently that she has discontinued that practice. I am pleased to say that she is still alive, but she does not consider it relevant to do that for me any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families do conduct themselves and do exchange gifts in a private way which is no business of this government at that level. At the level of exchange of substantial gifts which are contrivances to avoid government processes and government schemes, yes. But what worries me is that there is little indication of this set of regulations that it would not impose itself into those sorts of private arrangements which are perfectly normal. Earlier Senator Harradine was talking about section 12N. I immediately thought of a fairly normal thing that happens in my state of Tasmania. Grandfather arrives with his ute for the weekend and the family goes off and collects some firewood. Perhaps it is worth $87.50 for the weekend's effort. Somehow or other this government will impose itself into this relationship and see whether receipts have been issued, whether the weekend's effort has been properly documented and what the deemed income to the particular recipient might be in terms of the total family income. For goodness sake, get out of that area; you do not belong there. I am talking about bureaucrats, governments and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is normal family intercourse and that is what it ought to remain. It is certainly not the business of government. These gifts and arrangements are simply manifestations of natural, normal family life. Unless it is very careful, this government could stand accused of denying families the opportunity to behave as families. If this government seriously believes that families will comply with this nonsense by issuing receipts and keeping records of such interchanges as I have suggested, then reality has escaped this government completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reality has escaped this government previously in this area of Austudy and its regulations, when there was an attempt to redefine those students who had married under a certain age as not really being independent, even though they had set up their own family, even though they had moved away from physical or geographical dependence upon their parents. But no; this government attempted to deem that under a certain age, as far as Austudy was concerned, they were not really independent. What a cheek! I am glad to say that this chamber recognised it as such and was able, after a long struggle, thankfully, to defeat this bureaucratic proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warn the government that to continue this denial of reality and spending too much time in a bureaucratic haze of unreality will be revealed to the population. Unless it discontinues such propositions, people will wake up and realise how stupid these propositions are. I think Senator Harradine should be congratulated on making this move to alert the nation to the stupidity, inconsistency and danger of the proposition. If we adjourn this discussion and send the government away to come up with something that is a little more realistic, we will be serving the country well. I support such a move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a number of comments pursuant to the debate that took place yesterday. Senator Boswell raised a number of issues, some of which concerned me personally. I wish to put on the record that, contrary to the statements made by Senator Boswell, I did run a small business for some 15 years. I commenced that business, and in its latter years it employed up to 200 tradesmen. It is on the basis of the experience I gained from that&mdash;for example, we had to meet the payroll and operate in the building trade, which is one of the roughest industries in Australia&mdash;that I say again that audits are a useful management tool for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to point out to Senator Boswell that there is one very large community in the small business area that depends on adequate information about the companies it deals with&mdash;these are the creditors, the people who want to get paid. Before creditors offer services and supply goods, they want to be sure that the companies they deal with have the capacity to pay them when the goods and services are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is utterly misleading to say that this is an anti small business measure, when small business is big enough under two of the three criteria to be classed as a large business and therefore conduct audits and supply financial statements. On the contrary&mdash;this is a measure that assists small businesses to conduct their business in a proper, safe and secure manner. I believe that we need to monitor&mdash;and this has been put into the legislation&mdash;how these provisions will actually work in practice before we jump to the conclusion that we are imposing an unbearable load on small business. As I said, I believe that this will be largely of benefit to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the committee also did&mdash;and what Senator Boswell does not seem to be able to appreciate&mdash;was to strengthen the powers of the ASC to provide exemptions on a number of criteria, which include the criteria where a business finds it is an unreasonable burden in all the circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the heat of the debate yesterday I did make some disparaging remarks about Senator Spindler, and I do apologise. If he tells me he did run a business, then I certainly accept his word on that. But, nevertheless, that does not alter my commitment to opposition to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know where Senator Spindler is coming from. I think he is putting the cart well and truly before the horse. Senator Spindler was saying that the creditors of companies need some protection. Senator Spindler, you are trying to take the risk out of business. Business is risk. It is a matter of judgment and it is a matter of taking decisions, and the people who make the right decisions win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My problem with your proposition is that you are going to load business down with a $25,000 to $30,000 audit fee to protect the creditors. Let me tell you of my experience. In my 20 years of business, I lost something like $350 in bad debts, because my decision was that I dealt with the people that were there yesterday, were there today and I knew would be there tomorrow. There was no loss of revenue, but you cannot make business so foolproof that you take all the risk out of it. If you did that, you would make business so tied up with red tape that it could not survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do appeal to you again, because I do understand where you are coming from. I said yesterday that, out of every 100 businesses that start, in eight years time 92 or 93 will have gone out of business&mdash;some will be bought out, some will be taken over, some will go broke and some will actually grow. They go through a process. Some grow and develop, and employ people. Eventually, they will have 50 employees and have a turnover of $10 million, which is not an excessive amount of turnover, not a lot of turnover. Then, if we were to pass this legislation, we would come along and impose a $30,000 fee on that business to monitor or audit what is theirs. It is not a public business. There is not anyone else's money in it. It is their business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two aspects of the dealings of Australia Post which are of concern to me and I would hope are shared by other Australian citizens. Yesterday, I visited the general post office in the centre of Canberra. On other occasions I have visited this establishment and I have thought it was a busy and important part of Australia Post's activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday was a fine sunny day but one on which there was a cold snowy blast coming from the Brindabellas along the footpaths of Canberra. I was surprised to see a desk outside Australia Post, the GPO, in Canberra. On the desk were half a dozen telephone books and two people were attempting to find telephone numbers in those books. I thought this was a strange place for such a basic function of the post office to be located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inside the post office I noticed that considerable floor space was devoted to the display of items for sale. Those items for sale included boxes of computer disks, computer paper, Australian Tax Office employment declaration forms, passport application forms, Citibank credit card application forms, matchbox cars and replicas, and preschool reading books. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> was for sale in its own special box and there were bundles of fax paper. These things were in addition to those things you would expect to see in an Australia Post establishment, things such as greeting cards, gift wrapping, pens, pencils, sticky tape and writing pads&mdash;the sorts of things that have become common place in a post office and probably appreciated by the customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 16 people&mdash;I counted them&mdash;at the check-out, which was a sort of supermarket check-out. There is no actual counter any more. They all had in their hands postal articles&mdash;things such as parcels and long rolls with posters inside them. They were seeking to put stamps on them and put them into the system. None of the people lined up had boxes of computer disks to buy and none of them were anxiously awaiting service to have their Citibank credit card application form considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were five staff. They were very busy and there was one person roving about helping people. While I was there, the rover answered two inquiries from people. Both of them wanted to know where they could buy a stamp. They were in the post office and they wanted to know how to buy a stamp! They were directed to the multi-stamp packages that were hanging up along a wall with the other items for sale. The smallest package you could buy contained five 45c stamps. One of the people wanted to buy one stamp. Guess where he was directed to? Outside to the franking machine to get one of the frama labels. I think it is pretty poor that we have come to this situation. I will leave those comments there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I want to raise with regard to Australia Post is the fact that philatelists are being poorly served, again, by the way things have been organised in this new corporate, profit seeking, efficient, and economically rationalist Australia Post. The small, outlying territories of Australia&mdash;Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands, at least&mdash;for some time have been deriving a proportion of their income from servicing philatelists throughout the world. Part of the fascination that philatelists have with collecting is getting a first day cover stamped from, for example, the Cocos Islands or Christmas Island. As members of parliament, we are often told about new issues of stamps from places like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disappoints me, as a philatelist, to learn that the bureaus on that island will no longer be servicing the demands of philatelists because they have been rationally relocated to Melbourne; it is much more efficient to do it that way. When, as a collector, you get a first day cover and a stamp with a cancellation on it from Christmas Island, that is not really where it comes from anymore; it comes from Melbourne. True philatelists, who see some value in collecting things that originate from various remote parts of the world, are no longer impressed by these items of trade. The number of people who want to collect those things is therefore declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That needs to be recognised in terms of employment prospects on Christmas Island, the Cocos Islands, and other places like them, and in terms of the genuineness with which Australia Post seeks to meet the needs of collectors who&mdash;as was mentioned in a report presented to parliament some years ago&mdash;have contributed a considerable amount to the history, development and profitability of Australia Post. Those are the two matters I wish to raise and I hope other people are interested in them as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this matter of public interest debate this afternoon I want to address matters of grave concern to my constituents back in Western Australia&mdash;public inquiries and royal commissions. We seem to be in the season of public inquiries, judicial inquiries and royal commissions with the number of demands for inquiries that abound daily through our media. As I have mentioned in this place before, there is demand for an inquiry into what is colloquially known as Wanneroo Inc. The demands have increased since I last addressed this matter in this chamber a month or so ago, to the extent that the local federal member of parliament, Mr Paul Filing, Independent, has come out publicly and said that there should be an inquiry into the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the persons who would be questioned very closely in such an inquiry, if it were held, is a local state member of parliament, Mr Wayde Smith, about whom certain allegations have been floating. He in turn has said that the time has probably come for a public inquiry. There have been a number of other notable individuals in Wanneroo who have also come out and said yes, there must be an inquiry. I think there is pressure to bring one about very shortly. Interestingly enough, another local state member of parliament, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, is not one of the people who is on the record as calling for the inquiry. But the tempo is building up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also mention in our media about an inquiry into our police force. I have not had time to read all of the article but I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> more comment about the need for an inquiry into the Western Australian police force. Honourable senators, particularly those from New South Wales, would know what is coming out of the Wood royal commission in that state. I am certainly hopeful that that will not be replicated in my state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been demands for an inquiry into the operations of the office of the Deputy Public Prosecutor, a person who seems to get himself into the media quite frequently. Apparently the judiciary has said not too kind things about that particular office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the ongoing charade known as the Easton royal commission, which is costing our unfortunate Western Australian taxpayers something in the region of $4.5 million. Today is the last day, or so we are told, on which the commission will take public evidence. Unfortunately, it probably will not be the last we hear of that particular inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been advised that next week the commission will be hearing closing submissions from the lawyers who have taken part in that inquiry. I assume, and I would hope, that the lawyers for both the prosecution and the defence will be given the opportunity to put their closing statements at that time. I say `prosecution' and `defence' because it seems that has been the way this particular royal commission has been conducted, with a defence and a prosecution, which is somewhat different from what royal commissions or judicial inquiries should be about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Commissioner Marks probably could end this charade now. He could hand down his report now without waiting for those closing comments. I do not think he needs to wait until the closing date that has been suggested, the extended reporting date of 17 November, to bring down a report. I am firmly of the view, and I have said it before, that the royal commissioner could bring down his report now; or he could have given his report at the time when he was appointed to the royal commission, when he first accepted to act as the commissioner on the terms of reference from the Liberal Party Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial in last weekend's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23-24 September 1995 said that the commission had reached a point where no useful political, legal or moral purpose is being served by it and called for the WA government to take steps to terminate it. I do not think that that is going to happen. I do not think that the Premier, Mr Court, is going to see sense, but I would hope that Mr Marks could and, in doing so, salvage some of his own credibility by winding up this discredited Easton royal commission. I say `discredited', and I say that advisedly. It has been discredited not only by politicians on this side of the parliament or this side of the political fence, but also by what has come from the commissioner's own mouth. Commissioner Marks has acknowledged that the commission has lost its way. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have put myself in a position which is irrecoverable in some sense because this inquiry has become almost impossible to control in an objective sense.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Marks still has an opportunity to grab control of it. He can wind up this discredited farce; and, as a representative of the people of Western Australia, I call on him to release his findings and his report and his verdict. He has the quarter of a million bucks. He can put that in the bank and then start making attempts to live with himself from here on in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this matters of public interest debate to talk about the need for governments and the community as a whole to acknowledge the significant contribution that older Australians have made, and continue to make, to their community, and the need to make a commitment to the needs of seniors in our community. This is particularly pertinent because next Sunday, 1 October, is the United Nations International Day of Older Persons&mdash;a day on which the world's attention will focus on the important contribution older people make to the societies in which they live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people make up a significant and rapidly increasing segment of our community. In June 1994, there were 2,109,109 Australians aged 65 years and over. That represents 11.82 per cent of the population. Over the next 35 years, the number of people in that age group will increase to 2.52 million or over 20 per cent of the population&mdash;that is, one in every five Australians will be over 65 years of age. I might hasten to add here that I have a vested interest because I will be&mdash;hopefully, if I am still alive then&mdash;one of those people in that age group, but that is not the only thing that motivates me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With increased life expectancy, old age is becoming a long period of life. Ninety per cent of 40-year-olds can expect to reach 65 years of age, when men can expect to live for another 15 years and women another 19 years. So, compared with the beginning of this century, retirement can span several decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people are generally active, interested and talented; only eight per cent of older people are seriously impaired. To belie the myths that are out there about older people, a very small proportion&mdash;about four per cent to six per cent&mdash;of them live in residential institutions for older people. As Senator Crowley said here yesterday, most older people are living out in the community and caring for themselves, and some with some assistance. It is a myth to think that the majority of older people are in residential care. It is a very small proportion of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With advances in medicine and treatment, and increased knowledge of preventative medicine, older people can live a longer, enthusiastic, and healthy life and continue to make a contribution to society for a very long time. Older people contribute to our community in significant ways. Some participate in the paid work force. Unfortunately, if you are an Australian public servant, you cannot do that beyond the age of 65 years because this government has been reluctant to keep the promise it made in 1990 to extend the retirement age for people in the Public Service. The government has also refused to deal with my private member's bill and Mr Connolly's private member's bill relating to this issue. For those who are fortunate enough to work in private enterprise or are self-employed, they are able to stay on and participate in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other older people are doing unpaid work as carers; many of them as carers of other older people, or carers of young people with disabilities, or carers of their own children with disabilities. Many older people are also carers of grandchildren and work as voluntary workers in their community. We see examples over and over again of older people playing roles in hospitals, community organisations, Meals on Wheels and many other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise that there are a number of issues which are of great concern for seniors today. I have emphasised before, and I repeat again, the importance of understanding that older Australians are not a homogeneous group with static needs, but a diverse and dynamic group. Any discussion of older people must recognise that they come from a wide variety of cultural, educational and professional backgrounds, with very different financial circumstances, physical capabilities, lifestyles, opinions and expectations. They range from the very active and involved to the very frail aged, from those capable of looking after themselves in their old age to those who need, because of ill health or dementia, assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflecting this diversity, there are a number of issues that concern older people. These include: age discrimination in the work force; compulsory retirement on the basis of age; retirement incomes and superannuation; social security issues; health issues including health funding, health insurance, access to health and waiting lists in hospitals; and community care that enables real choice for older people when they need assistance to remain in their own homes. Those who care for older people also have concerns. Many of them are old themselves, in particular, older women. There are issues associated with residential accommodation and its funding, and issues of mental health such as the increasing number of people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a general level, the policy challenge for governments is to provide the elderly with opportunities to contribute according to their interests, abilities and needs, whether that is by involving them in decision making, encouraging income earning or voluntary activities, or providing recreational, educational and social activities. At the same time, governments must ensure that income security and appropriate and affordable support and care is available to those elderly who require them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to retirement incomes, we have seen this government deal those who have attempted to provide for themselves, either by supplementing their pension or those who are providing for themselves by fully supporting themselves, quite an incredible blow with respect to the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of assessing a pension. We saw how, with pressure from the Senate&mdash;from the opposition and with the assistance of the Democrats&mdash;the government was forced to do a review that looked at trying to address the inequities and the difficulties that pensioners were facing, especially when the share market was increasing, with a totally unpredictable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That pressure resulted in a company called Ageing Agendas undertaking a review of pensions income and assets tests. It highlighted concerns that the current retirement income policy arrangements were far too complex, that they did not cater for different situations of people and did not provide enough incentives for retirees to make the best use of their resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, older people have arranged their financial affairs to qualify for the pension and no-one can blame them for that. The financial incentives of getting a pension, the stability and the predicability and security encourage people to reduce their incomes to qualify for at least some pension and to hold assets which are exempted from the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people who did not earn very much during their working lives there is little doubt that the age pension discourages savings. Why save if the government will provide a similar amount in retirement if a person has not saved? We have also seen people on fixed retirement incomes with fixed superannuation annuities who are suffering under quite difficult situations on the same income as a pensioner and are not able to get some of the same benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people who are better off choose to retire early on their own savings but there is no encouragement to maintain those savings. Many of them dissipate their savings and claim the pension once the age of pension eligibility has been reached. There needs to be a total review of the issues surrounding pensions and provision of retirement incomes for older people. Ageing Agendas did this in part but it was basically only looking at the assets and incomes test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that although some self-funded retirees&mdash;those who fully or partially support themselves in retirement&mdash;have been more fortunate than others, many of them have been frugal and have saved. They feel that they have been penalised for this in some ways. Many of them are concerned that a pensioner gets a pensioner concession card and they do not, that the pensioner does not pay tax until their income exceeds $10,720 a year, whereas the self-funded retiree pays tax on each dollar over $5,400 and by the time they get to $10,720 they will have paid about $1,000 in tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind senators that in the 1993 election the government promised pensioners that they would be taken out of the tax system. It was only five days after the election that Dr Blewett, the then Minister for Social Security, had the gall to say that they had made a mistake. Every piece of publicity that every Labor Party candidate put out right up to the election stated that pensioners would be taken out of the tax system, but that was one of the first promises that was broken only five days after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another promise that was broken to older people was the promise about the l-a-w tax cuts. There they were in law. In another typical pea and thimble trick, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delayed the tranche of those tax cuts and then the second disappeared into the never-never for a lot of people. Some of them will get it back in superannuation in the never-never, but what happened to tax cuts for self-funded retirees? They do not get superannuation. So before the last election pensioners were told they were going to be taken out of the tax system and self-funded retirees were told they were going to get tax cuts. Both groups have been let down by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government's treatment of self-funded retirees is nothing short of an absolute disgrace. These people have contributed billions of dollars to taxation over their working lives. They continue to pay tax and they have been treated this way by the government, in particular, about the tax cuts that they were anticipating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done much to undermine the certainty and lifestyle of many seniors. In the area of superannuation, we have seen continual changing of the goalposts with complicated and constantly changing sets of rules and, with the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge, there is increasing uncertainty that there will be adequate superannuation for the majority of Australians. It is no wonder that people in this situation contemplate ways to dispose of their assets and then enter tax free retirement as a charge on taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where the government has failed to address the issue pertaining to older people is the area of retirement incomes for women. Women live longer than men. They have a much longer period in which to support themselves following retirement or the death of a spouse. For women, the situation in regard to superannuation is grim. It is generally acknowledged that, because of the broken work patterns of women, lower incomes and the effect of taxes and charges on superannuation accounts, many women will be severely disadvantaged in their senior years. The government has not addressed the issue of women and their particular needs with regard to superannuation retirement incomes. It is a sad reflection on the government that it has not done anything to address that issue over 13 years of Labor in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of the incomes and assets test, the government has failed to undertake a comprehensive review and the entire system needs to be overhauled. It has also failed to address the urgent need for adequate funding arrangements for nursing homes and hostels. Its own committee, chaired by Professor Gregory, has indicated that $500 million is required to bring nursing homes and hostels up to current standards. What did the government give in the last budget? It gave $36 million over three years. That is not even going to touch the sides. Over the last 13 years, this government has let that capital run down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where the government has failed and failed dismally is the area of provision of care for people with dementia. It set up dementia specific facilities and then decided that it was not going to fund them. We have seen one close down and others have said that it is impossible for them to continue with the current funding. They have to cross-subsidise. They say that, if there were some funding between nursing homes and hostels, they could manage. When those hostels close down, the people will inevitably go into a nursing home. They will cost the taxpayer more and they will not have the quality of life that they have now. Why the government has refused to address that issue is beyond my comprehension. As we approach 1 October, which is United Nations International Day of Older Persons&mdash;a day to celebrate and to recognise older people&mdash;this government needs to look squarely at its failure to meet the needs of older Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on matters of public interest, I rise to speak about the appalling road system in northern New South Wales. This Labor government should take warning that key marginal seats will fall because of its failed roads policy in northern New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton is the architect of yet another disaster. In New South Wales, he funded the tunnel, the Darling Harbour scheme and the monorail. He has now turned his talents to the federal scene and we have had some evidence of this with the industrial relations policy, the airport runways and the neglected road system, particularly the Pacific Highway between the cities of Sydney and Brisbane. Sydney is the largest city in Australia. By 2040 Brisbane will be the second largest. Yet, between these two major cities, we have nothing more than a goat track. There has been an appalling lack of progress on this road over the last 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real state of this road came home to me during the two trips that I undertook on it this year. One trip was in relation to the black spot road funding program and the other trip was with Senator Campbell and his youth bus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. When we undertook the trip by bus, it had been 14 years since I had travelled on the road by bus. I was amazed by how dangerous it seemed as we approached bridges&mdash;Senator Campbell will remember this&mdash;and where trucks at the other end of the bridge stopped because they realise that, if you put a bus and a truck side by side on these 1920s bridges, you are in danger of a major accident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much improved roadway is there between the cities of Newcastle and Brisbane? This is the worst stretch of the Pacific Highway. In this vast area, which takes 14 hours to drive, there is a grand total of 64 kilometres of divided road. There is a massive backlog in spending on roads in northern New South Wales. Our candidates in the area&mdash;Bob Baldwin in Paterson, Anne Hunter in Page and Keith Johnson in Richmond&mdash;are well aware of this and they have targeted the main black spots in their own electorates. Our candidates are driving home to the electors of Richmond, Page and Paterson how poorly treated they are in terms of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How long will it take to fix the problem? The federal Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics found that $4 billion is needed to fix the Pacific Highway problem. The road could stay in this condition for another 40 years at the present rate of improvement. It remains the worst interstate road link in Australia. If the highway is left in its present condition, injury and death will escalate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that, over the coming 10 years, there will be 10,000 injuries and some 2 1/2 thousand deaths on this road. Surely that is a reason for putting some priority on it. We all remember the horror of one major accident, the Kempsey bus crash in 1989. Reg and Dorothy Kelly of Clybucca Flat, in recalling this event, told their story to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> on 23 July 1995. They called for an urgent upgrade of the Pacific Highway before the tragedy and deaths that they witnessed can be repeated. They recalled in the article the horror of the morning of the crash. Standing on their verandah they could see the accident scene from a distance. As they drew closer, the full extent of the carnage became clear; bloody survivors were clambering from the wreckage of the two coaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty-five people died and 41 were injured in this crash. Mrs Kelly has called on the federal government to take urgent action to build a divided highway as she believes that this is the only means of preventing more deaths. After this major accident the government did put a little bit more money towards the road, such was the public outrage. The government introduced a black spot program and put up $1 billion in funding. What has happened since? If you move on to two years after that time in 1988, the money was dwindling away, and, after four years, the program totally disappeared from the federal government's budget. Nothing is being spent on black spots. The road needs $4 billion in expenditure and yet nothing is being spent on black spots. This is an absolute disgrace. There are 80 major black spot problem areas that remain untouched and some of the work is not scheduled until the end of the century. This issue went from public consciousness when the Keating government started to cut spending, but the issue has not gone away and the public knows that another smash is quite possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1985, the highway has claimed more lives than any other major Australian road. This year there have been 16 fatal accidents and 20 lives lost between Hexham and the Queensland border, the worst stretch of road. This is the human cost of the Keating government's failed road policy of under-expenditure on regional roads in this country. Poor and deteriorating rural and regional road infrastructure is the rule, not the exception. The roads of the north coast of New South Wales and the Pacific Highway in particular make a notorious case study of ALP neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a catalogue of how Labor exercises duty of care to road users over the last 13 years. The Australian Automobile Association, in its 1995-96 budget submission, made some telling points. The association said that Labor must use this budget to reverse the deterioration of Australian road infrastructure. The last 15 years has witnessed an escalation of the tax take by governments from fuel excise and imposts on motorists, while road infrastructure investment has languished. The impact in regional centres such as Maitland, Grafton and Lismore are many&mdash;injury and death, extra time travelled, extra fuel costs on travel, inefficient use of energy and fuel resources, impacts that are adverse to the environment, regional growth being stunted, inflated regional costs for business and reduced export opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal fuel tax on every litre of petrol puts 33c back in federal coffers but, of that 33c, only 7c is spent on roads. The return of just another 7c a litre would see measurable improvements in our roads. It would reduce road trauma and death, increase employment opportunities and lift regional growth. We are, according to a recent finding, an extremely wealthy nation. We should, on the basis of all being worth $1.1 million, have enormous resources to fix this problem. But, instead, what we have in our country are death traps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Transport, Communications and Economics figures on road related revenue and expenditure show clearly why Australian roads are below best practice. In 1982-83, the Liberal government had road taxes and charges at $3.9 billion. Road expenditure in that year was $4.3 billion. We were spending more than we were raising. Under Keating, the road taxes and charges collected in the most recent financial year are $11 billion. The expenditure was $5 billion. That is a spending of under half the money that is collected for roads on roads. The rest of it goes back into general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia, in a 1994 paper entitled `Refocusing roads and reform', shows the folly of Labor's current tax and keep approach. The council claims that a more efficient management of expenditure on roads could produce a gain to GDP of $10 billion over the next 10 years. We are talking about an expenditure of $4 billion to fix the problem, yet if we spend that $4 billion we will gain $10 billion. Such is the short-sightedness of this government's policies that it is not even prepared to make a start on the expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council report went further and stated that Australia's primary road network is below world best practice, that less than 10 per cent of all Australian urban travel is on controlled access primary roads. In the US, the comparative figure is 40 per cent. This is a real problem as our stop and start major roads are inefficient compared to freeways. Freeways and proper divided roads, which is what we are advocating for the north coast, have 70 per cent fewer accidents, 30 per cent less fuel consumption, 50 to 100 per cent less fuel emissions and 50 per cent less cost in time for business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of all this, the ALP government's decision to renege on promises for black spot funding is appalling. The hypocrisy of this Keating government really knows no bounds on this issue. This government cancelled programs on the Pacific Highway after the tragic coach deaths. It is trying to force local government to pick up the tab for what is really national priority work. The Bureau of Transport, Communications and Economics has shown the benefit of black spot improvements. The reduction in accidents at these sites was more than 2 1/2 times greater than at untreated sites. The coalition government will reintroduce black spot funding as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up on the north coast where this money has not been spent and these roads have not been improved, the ALP sitting members try to distance themselves from the Keating government but they cannot really hide their ALP affiliation. It is amazing that when the major improvement on this program which was to be done by the Liberal government&mdash;the Pacific tollway&mdash;was scrapped just after the Carr government was elected, there was not a peep out of Bob Horne in Paterson, out of Harry Woods in Page or out of Neville Newell in Richmond, and they are supposed to be representing their constituents. </PARA>

Senator Campbell actually drove past that, where the expressway goes from four lanes down to a two-lane country road carrying the main traffic out of Sydney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this public interest debate I want to raise the issue of illegal entrants, the mandatory detention of asylum seekers and the current push by the government to deport them against their will. The matter was referred to in the adjournment debate last night. I feel it is important to bring to this chamber and to the general public the story of two Cambodian asylum seekers currently facing deportation at any moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two young men, Sok Kheng Ngep and Sok Khom Ngep, arrived on the boat nicknamed `Collie' in 1990 aged 16 and 17 years. They were rescued by an Australian navy boat because the boat that they were travelling on was in such a difficult and dangerous situation that it was about to sink. Having been brought to Port Hedland they were kept in detention and have been there for the last five years. Because of legislation that was passed in this chamber in both May and December 1992, they were deprived of being able to appeal to the court on the grounds of illegal detention. Also, any chance of compensation was ruled out of order by legislation which has recently been reinstated, which was proposed in December 1992 and overruled by a court, to reduce any compensation for illegal detention to a dollar a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These young men not only have been imprisoned at a stage in their development which would be deleterious to anybody but also they have been in the category of those asylum seekers who have been most penalised by the interaction between this parliament and the courts of our land. If it is not bad enough that these two have been held in detention for almost five years, the government is now intending to deport them to Cambodia where they have no relatives and no prospect of a normal life. Since they left their country, their relatives have been able to gain asylum in America. While they have made inquiries about going there, they have been informed by the United States authorities that that process will take two or three years. If Australia deports them back to Cambodia, it certainly will not be deporting them to their home. It will be deporting them to a place from which they fled and to which they have no family connections or prospects of a normal life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time that they have been in detention in Port Hedland, the department did offer them, through the minister, the prospect of returning to Cambodia for one year. They could then reapply to come back to Australia. This offer was taken up by many people who were in detention. It was a way of getting out of their invidious situation. I think 160 of the people who went back to Cambodia for one year they are now back in Australia having been legally accepted to stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because these two young men were afraid of returning and because they had no place to return to and no connections which they could renew, they are now being penalised. They are going to be forcibly deported against their will. There are also some doubts about the way in which the department of immigration advised these brothers during various stages of their refugee claim process. The brothers were listed with others in their category who came in on the same boat to go before the court. In actual fact, they are two of the four Cambodians remaining in detention at Port Hedland. They are the only two who are under threat of deportation. The other two Cambodians remained on a court list and their case is still to be heard in the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these two brothers were advised that, if they withdrew their appeal to the court and resumed the usual process of going through the refugee review tribunal process and if they were then knocked back, they would have a better chance of gaining humanitarian visas or entries to Australia. On the basis of that advice, and I have good authority to support this, they withdrew their legal appeals and this has now left them vulnerable. We know that the humanitarian category to which they were extending their hopes has been removed. They rely only on the minister's discretion, and the compassion of the people who support them in this place, to allow them bridging visas so that a way can be found to allow them to stay in Australia at least until such time that they can make the appropriate approaches to rejoin their parents in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that it may well be that the minister for immigration feels no legal obligation to do this, but I certainly believe there is a moral one. The migration act has been amended time and again, as we know, to deny people such as the two brothers the most fundamental of human rights&mdash;for instance, freedom of movement and proper access to the legal system. There are Cambodian groups in Australia who are willing to support the two brothers if only they were given the chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the saga of boat people has been one of shame for Australia for the past six years. This incident provides an opportunity for the government to act with compassion. I only hope that the opportunity is not lost. It disturbs me enormously when the public debate on these matters fails to take into consideration the actual details of the lives of the people we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite true that the people of Australia are concerned about the increase in migration numbers. There are many people within the Green movement who are concerned that we are not giving sufficient attention to the appropriate level of population within our country so that we maintain the quality of life and the quality of the environment that we enjoy at the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that people are very concerned about the way in which multinational and overseas interests are gaining access to land and developments within our own country and the way in which capital and investment profits are disappearing overseas. This concern in the community is far more connected to the knowledge that the immigration numbers are increasing and that business migration is increasing than to asylum seekers. Comments are made in the press that seem to relate the problem to the absolutely unrelated matter of the relatively small numbers of illegal entrants to this country who have fled from their own countries, have nowhere to go and seek asylum on our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of illegal migrants is vastly different from the matter which has attracted the concern and antagonism of the people of Australia. People are concerned, but they are not well informed. They do not understand that the reality of the increase in migration is totally independent of boat people, asylum seekers and those who are being detained mandatorily at Port Hedland, sometimes at Darwin and at the Curtin base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These illegal entrants are a very small proportion of those we could call illegal migrants: those who come into our country with authorisation and then overstay, disappear or otherwise flaunt the basis on which they entered the country. They are a far greater number. They are not detained in custody; they are allowed bridging visas on an almost automatic basis the minute they come here. In a way it is essential so, because if we detained them mandatorily in detention we would have a much larger detention system than any of our prison systems at the current moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unfair that, when people who are in detention seek compassionate and humanitarian release into the community, the other argument about the extent of migration and business migration&mdash;which is being used in an opportunistic way by the government&mdash;is thrown up to attack them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the Australian community are much more compassionate than the government gives them credit for. A very clear distinction should be made between the concerns about the population growth rate, immigration numbers and the people who seek asylum on our shores. We have to look at the reputation that Australia wants to have in the eyes of the world, and, at the moment, we are displaying a double standard. On the one hand, we are talking about human rights violations all around the world as though we are on the high moral ground. On the other hand, the way in which we have dealt with asylum seekers&mdash;particularly in the last four or five years&mdash;is a disgrace that will come back to haunt us when people see that we are being so punitive and so lacking in compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge my colleagues to look at this matter to try to separate out the two different aspects of migration. There are many in the Greens who want us to have a look at the impact of migration overall, but there are also those who are well aware that the human rights needs of people who are fleeing their country and are afraid to return have to be respected. Because we have been detaining these people in custody we have incurred an enormous bill for which they are not to blame. If we choose as a government&mdash;which is what both major parties are responsible for doing&mdash;to detain and to virtually imprison these people, then we cannot complain that the cost of their detention lies at their feet; it lies at our feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Churches and community groups right around Australia have been adamant that they would be delighted to assist in the support of these people in the community, which would be far less costly. Those offers have been repeatedly refused by the government. Then we start hearing figures of how costly it is to keep them in detention and, also, that lawyers are being blamed for working on behalf of these people to give them the legitimate citizenship access to their legal rights that anyone in the world should have on a free basis. So we are now attacking the lawyers who provide what is, I believe, a very good and commendable service for also being part of the process by which they remain longer in the country and increase the bill that we have generated by our refusal to allow them entry on a bridging visa basis into our own community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge my colleagues to look at the case of Sok Kheng Ngep and Sok Khom Ngep. They have been in detention for five years. They are still as afraid of returning to Cambodia as they were when they fled and I believe, by wanting to deport them, the government is wanting to remove from our shores the evidence of our own guilt and inhumanity towards them. I can only urge the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to rethink his stance on this issue and allow them bridging visas, allow them to avail themselves of the community support which they have been offered and make the arrangements that they are seeking to make a new life for themselves in freedom rather than in custody. </PARA>

I note and acknowledge the presence in the chamber of Senator Burns. I am sure he would agree with me that one of the grave problems we have is that there are areas of Queensland that have enormous resources but which do not get the development they deserve. One of the reasons for this is the simple fact that there is a tax regime in place at the moment which punishes companies for putting investment into regional Australia. The tax regime in question is the fringe benefits tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain to honourable senators why this is such a problem. Take, for example, north-west Queensland, an area which is an immensely rich mineral province. North-west Queensland is home to mines like Century, Mount Isa&mdash;it was home to Mary Kathleen&mdash;Ernest Henry, Duchess and so on. Yet if Mount Isa had been started in the 1990s instead of when it was started, there would be hardly anybody living in Mount Isa. Senator Campbell, who is in the chamber and comes from Western Australia, knows exactly what I mean. Companies are forced to pay fringe benefits tax on the deemed fringe benefit that they give in providing accommodation to workers and their families who move to work in those mines. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some fringe benefit, indeed! Instead, what happens is, so as to not have to pay fringe benefits tax, the companies are forced to do what they would call fly-in fly-out operations. In some cases it is proposed that the workers for these mines in north-west Queensland will be based in Brisbane. Their families will live in Brisbane and it is cheaper for the company to fly those people on a chartered jet up to the mine and fly them back at the end of the week, than it is for the company to make an investment in providing accommodation for those people in the area. If this is the way the Labor Party believes that we are going to achieve development of regional Australia, I have one very simple message for them: I am sorry, you are wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this fringe benefits tax regime penalises regional Australia. It penalises communities that ought to be getting some sort of benefit from these mines. And, remember, the resources that are ripped up are ripped up from these areas. The people in the townships surrounding those resources get only one chance to get the maximum benefit from those resources. The only time that those resources are worth anything to those people is at the time that they are mined. So, what happens? The government puts in place a tax regime that means that those townships miss their once in a lifetime opportunity to get some benefit from the resources that lie underneath them. That is what this government is doing. It is wholly and utterly immoral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government that claims to represent the workers. Yet what sort of a lifestyle is it for the workers in these mines to be flown, sometimes over a thousand kilometres from their home, out to work in a mine for a week, not be able to see their family, and then flown back? It is not fair on the workers, it is not fair on their families and it is not fair on the community. A simple change to the fringe benefits tax regime in this country to exempt those remote areas would lead to an increase in investment and an increase in infrastructure spending by the private sector, not the government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might surprise people to know that many of the problems in rural and regional Australia could be ameliorated without a cent of taxpayers' dollars, if only the government was willing to see sense. The crazy thing is that, as the companies avoid the fringe benefits tax liability by flying the workers in and out, the cost of flying them in and flying them out is fully deductible as a tax expense by the company. So, instead of getting extra tax revenue for the government, we are adding to the costs of the mining industry in this country and we are reducing the tax that those companies will pay. They deduct the cost of flying the workers in and flying them out from the profits that they make. Here we have a ham-fisted, lamb-brained government that cannot understand the consequences of its own tax legislation, and people in regional Australia are paying the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say here, and I have said it many times before, that the government has to recognise that it has a responsibility to more than just Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. The government has a responsibility to all of Australia and tax laws such as this should be scrapped to ensure some fairness and some equity for people who live in regional Australia. If the Labor government will not do it, I am sure that the people of regional Australia will get a much better go under the coalition government that will come in at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most Australians know and are proud of the fact that Australia is one of the world's greatest sporting nations. We were reminded of that in the early hours of Monday morning, Australian time, by Mick Doohan who, for the second year in a row, won the 500cc motorcycle world championships. Indeed, he is the first Australian to do so back-to-back. We have had a proud record of achievement at every Olympic Games since the very first modern Olympic Games when a young Australian, who was a merchant banker in London at the time, went across to the Olympics and won a medal. At the Commonwealth Games, of course, we have an even better record in a whole range of sports. The most recent games in Victoria, Canada, were one of Australia's best Commonwealth Games ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak in this matter of public interest debate because, for the second time in the last 30-odd years, the sport of shooting has, at this stage, been taken off the list of sports for the year 2002 games to be hosted by the City of Manchester. I wanted to raise this matter in the national parliament because it is something that I am appalled by, as are sporting shooters across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is to be consideration given to this matter at a meeting of the Commonwealth Games Federation congress in Bermuda on 3 November 1995. I want to ensure that the Commonwealth Games Association of Australia delegates, and delegates from other Commonwealth nations around the world who attend that conference in Bermuda, are fully aware of the views on this matter which are strongly held by members and senators from all political sides in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to exclude shooting is a bad one for all of the Commonwealth nations, and for the Commonwealth Games, but it is a particularly bad one for Australia. I have not gone back past 1966 to look at the history of our achievements in this sport, but our achievements since 1966 are impressive. Indeed, the only year since 1966 in which shooting was not included on the Commonwealth Games list of sports was 1970, in Edinburgh. It is good to see that the Scots made amends in 1986 and did include it on the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In l966, in Kingston, Jamaica, we won a silver medal and a bronze medal. In l974, in Christchurch, we won a gold, a silver and a bronze. In Edmonton, Canada, in 1978, we won two bronze medals. In Brisbane, in 1982, we won seven gold, three silver and four bronze. In Edinburgh we won four gold, seven silver and three bronze. In Auckland we won seven gold, five silver and three bronze. Last year was our most successful year: in Victoria, Canada we won 10 gold medals, five silver medals and four bronze medals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that this be an issue that is brought to the public attention. It is a matter which will be of great interest amongst sporting shooters and competitive shooters across this nation. I know that all politicians would far prefer that shooting take place in a competitive, controlled environment, where the shooting is done at targets, rather than on the streets and at moving targets. The encouragement of sporting shooting is quite crucial, not only in terms of public safety but in its own right as an enormously important and successful sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the organisers of the Manchester Games, who have excluded shooting from the list for those games in the year 2002, to think very seriously about the implications of this. Sporting shooting is a very important sport in many of the nations of the Commonwealth. It is not a sport that achieves an enormously high public profile, but the level of participation in sporting shooting and competitive shooting is very high across Australia and across a number of other Commonwealth countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be an absolute disaster&mdash;and, I would go so far as to say, a disgrace&mdash;if the organisers of the Commonwealth Games in Manchester were to leave it off the list. I urge them to reconsider. I urge the delegates at the meeting on 3 November at the CGF congress in Bermuda to put all force possible on the organisers to have them include shooting on the list for the games at Manchester. I wish Ray Godkin, the President of the Commonwealth Games Association, and our other delegates at the meeting in Bermuda the very best of success in having shooting put back on the list for Manchester. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few remaining minutes, there are a couple of matters that have been discussed during this lunch hour to which I do want to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter I want to respond to is Senator O'Chee's incredible claim that fringe benefits tax is responsible for the relatively new policy, of the last decade or so, of fly-in fly-out mining operations in Australia. Firstly, the fringe benefits tax introduced by this government was an essential part of any tax reform ensuring the equity of our tax system in this country. It ensures that all forms of income are taxed. That is as it should be, because fringe benefits generally apply to people with higher incomes. It is people on lower incomes who do not have access to fringe benefits. It is only right and proper that fringe benefits be included in the tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity, as parliamentary secretary for primary industry and resource matters, to visit a number of these mining communities. About two months ago, I went to Roxby Downs in South Australia where I discussed this issue of fly-in and fly-out mining operations. Roxby Downs has been operating for about five or six years and it has a township built on site, like a lot of the other mining developments of the last 30 or 40 years. In discussing the issue of the fly-in and fly-out operations, there is a world wide trend to fly-in and fly-out. It has very little to do with a fringe benefits tax. Certainly, I will accept that it may be a consideration, but there are a number of other important issues that mining companies consider when determining how they operate the supply of labour to a mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of issues that are now considered right around the world are primarily social considerations. Mining companies are giving very serious consideration to the importance of not transplanting a group of people into an artificial environment in an isolated township. Certainly, the costs of such operations are a consideration, but a fringe benefits tax is a very minor part of the cost of operations for the mine. As I have said, the world wide tendency is towards abandoning fly-in and fly-out operations. I think, on balance, the reasons that mining companies give are that it is in the best interests of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney gave us a contribution about road funding in the northern part of New South Wales. He alleges neglect by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and by members of other electorates on the north coast of New South Wales. In reference to what he says are billions of dollars worth of expenditure required on roads in northern New South Wales, Senator Tierney concluded his speech by saying that that will start when a Liberal government is elected. I am not sure what he was saying, but he certainly gave the impression that the day a Liberal government is elected, whenever that may be, there will be billions of dollars expended on roads in northern New South Wales and that that will virtually happen overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is an early preview of what will be in the opposition's policies, I certainly welcome it. However, I question whether Senator Tierney has the imprimatur of the opposition to be announcing the expenditure of billions of dollars on highway funding as soon as a Liberal government is elected. I applaud him for his honesty but I doubt very much whether we are going to be seeing billions of dollars committed on highway funding in New South Wales as soon as a Liberal government is elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the roads that he referred to are not the responsibility of the national government. As I understand it, we have a responsibility for the National Highway, but we do not have responsibility for the rural and regional roads throughout northern New South Wales. If Senator Tierney has managed to include that promise to spend billions of dollars on roads in northern New South Wales in the opposition's package, which we are yet to see&mdash;but he gave us a little looksee during the luncheon debate today&mdash;it will be very interesting to see whether that sort of expenditure is going to be committed to every other rural and regional area of Australia. The cost of that sort of a promise will add up to billions of dollars. Where is the money going to come from and when are we going to see the opposition's policies?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian business community are worried by the opposition on several fronts. On one front they are worried by the opposition because of its hostility to foreign investment. They are shocked by the opposition on their industrial relations policy. But today they are shocked even further by the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, that he intends to punch a $2 billion hole in the 1996-97 budget by blocking the sale of the federal airports. They are shocked because this is an opposition intent on destroying a budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that is an extraordinarily bad signal to the business community about stability in government, the other thing that should be said is that the people who will bear the burden of that are ordinary Australians. This budget is in surplus. The next budget would be in surplus, if the sale were to go ahead. By virtue of those surpluses, there will be downward pressure asserted on interest rates in Australia because we have public savings because of the budget surpluses. Knock that out and, of course, there will be upward pressure on interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who will wear the responsibility for that will be Mr Howard and this opposition, if they proceed with their plans.

But, on the other hand, he is proposing to stop the third runway and to end micro-economic reform in the transport sector with this important reform.

Not only is he stopping the $2.5 billion from the sale of the airports but his party in the Senate, which is supposed to be independent and cannot be directed of course, is knocking holes in both the spending and the revenue sides of the budget.

The only role that the Commonwealth has in legislative terms is powers over the export of woodchips.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Minister, in your response to a question from Senator Chris Evans yesterday, you seemed to suggest that quarantine standards in other countries were being used as an unfair trade barrier against Australian agricultural products, such as apples, pears and citrus fruit. You also seemed to imply that quarantine standards needed to be lowered. Is it not true that Canadian salmon exporters are using the same argument to push for salmon imports into Australia? Is it not also true, as claimed on Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, that this is in fact a response to the Uruguay Round of GATT, whereby countries were pushed to lower quarantine standards and, as a result, so-called free trade under GATT will facilitate the sharing of animal and plant diseases and pests worldwide? Does the minister agree that, as a consequence of these changes in international trade regulations, Australia's ability to adopt the precautionary principle in setting quarantine standards will be adversely affected by the requirement that you alluded to yesterday that it be `justified on scientific grounds'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of that question is no. The answer to the very first part of the question is yes. In relation to your comments in between, can I make it clear that we regard it as very important that it is recognised that the basic aim of the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is to maintain and does maintain the sovereign right of any government, including the Australian government, to provide the level of health protection it deems appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise the right of other countries to do that and have never challenged that.

Australia has some unique characteristics&mdash;and they apply to some of the cases you referred to, Senator&mdash;that have to be taken into account and may in certain circumstances, perhaps including some of those to which you referred, justify us having higher standards than others, because we are in different circumstances. But it does not mean that we should sit idly by and allow others to create barriers so that Australian apple growers, other fruit growers, tomato growers and Australians involved in a whole range of horticultural activities are denied legitimate access to those markets and people in those markets are denied access to quality food at cheap prices.</PARA>

The answer said, for example, that no figures were available for the period March to June 1985. Why on earth not? What is going on? When asking a simple question about what the Prime Minister's travel allowance is, you get mucked around by getting an answer that specifically excludes several months. Then, when you ask someone to correct the answer and give the facts, you have to wait another six months with still no answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Prime Minister got to hide about his travel allowance? We all know about how he managed to live in Canberra and get a travel allowance because he put down his address as being Sydney. We know that, and we know how retrospectively that fiddle was fixed under the previous government when the Prime Minister was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly poor when this Senate is effectively denied for so long&mdash;and I presume I am getting an answer now only because I am nagging&mdash;a proper answer to a proper question. I regard as unfortunate that, in the first place, the original answer to my question in February was not complete and, secondly, trying to get a complete answer has taken so long. What has the Prime Minister got to hide?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Wheelwright this day, relating to the proposed privatisation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister in his answer claimed that the coalition's decision to seek deferral of the privatisation of Kingsford Smith Airport until a fair deal has been worked out for a fair sharing of the noise problem&mdash;including the reuse of the east-west runway&mdash;would cost the 1996-97 budget between $2 million and $2.5 million. That statement by Senator Cook is typical of his and his government's statements in that it was misleading, it was deceitful and it was simply untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least the minister said that the problem would arise, as he saw it, in 1996-97. In an interview this morning the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not know that that was the case. The Prime Minister this morning did not even know which budget might be involved; he just said `the budget'. The clear implication to be drawn from what Mr Keating said this morning, or what he meant to give the impression of, was that the decision would impact on this year's budget&mdash;the 1995-96 budget. That is not true. There are no proceeds included by the government in the budget papers or the budget figures for this year's budget. So the impression that the Prime Minister gave this morning was deceitful, dishonest and untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is as John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, said this morning in a doorstop interview. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government needn't have a hole in its budget. In fact, there is no money for Sydney airport, as I understand it, in this year's budget anyway&mdash;so that's another piece of exaggeration.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he picked up that very obvious point by the government. The other important point is that there need not and will not be a budget hole at all, including in the 1996-97 budget, if the government takes the simple measures that are necessary to reopen for reuse the east-west airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it was only a week ago, on the 22nd, that the government placed an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in connection with the sale of the FAC with the objective of seeking expressions of interest to be made in early to mid-1996, followed by a formal leasing process and culminating in the completion of the leasing process&mdash;that is, stage 1&mdash;at the end of 1996. There is no intention at all, and there never was any intention, to include even one cent in the 1995-96 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the hole that will occur in the budget of 1995-96 will occur not because of any actions by the coalition but because the government does not have a hope in Hades&mdash;and never did have a hope in Hades&mdash;of realising the asset sales figure of $5.3 billion that it included in the 1995-96 budget. There is no way in the world that that figure can be reached. Indeed, it even looks as though the sale of the Commonwealth Bank shares&mdash;for which a huge amount must be raised if the government is even to get within a bull's roar of its estimated figure for this year&mdash;will be deferred, as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said two days ago, until after the election. So, unless the election is held before Christmas of this year, there is no way that the government will get those sale proceeds in either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, on that basis the government will be $2 billion to $3 1/2 billion short of the proceeds from asset sales this year&mdash;and that is where the real lie has come.

That is a fact. I know that the operational people within those airlines know that operating two parallel runways is safer than operating aircraft arriving at the same time on intersecting runways. Even my six-year-old kid knows that. Let me quote the evidence by the president of the air traffic controllers association to Senator Parer in a Senate committee.

<PARA>That statement was made by the president of the air traffic controllers association, and you do not need an expert to tell you that. As a result of a very serious incident at Sydney we had to ban international aircraft other than Qantas from using the airport when Simops was in operation, and it was less safe than the existing arrangements.

<PARA>My question related to Australia's importation of possibly damaging items in relation to our primary industries. I notice that in the last year there have been many questions, motions and concerns raised during speeches in the Senate in relation to the importation of food products, animals and plants as trade goods. The base of these concerns has been the introduction of diseases or parasites which may infect our animals and plants, both cultivated and wild. Senators from Tasmania have brought up the impact on fisheries many times. The Greens and others have brought up these and other issues, such as the potential impact of Newcastle disease on both the domestic poultry industry and our native birds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seem to be more and more issues related to allowing products through quarantine now. Often products have not been allowed before. The major reason for this seems to be negotiations to drop so-called trade barriers. Under the Uruguay Round of GATT and the World Trade Organisation we are allowed to set up quarantine. However, this must be based on what Senator McMullan has called `valid scientific grounds'. Once it is determined that there is a real cause, it must be shown that quarantine is the least restrictive option for dealing with the problem. Only then will it be acknowledged that quarantine is not a protectionist trade barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly we have the people who are concerned about farmers and the fishing industry put in the same position that those who are environmentally concerned have been in for generations. We now have a situation where farmers have to prove why they should be allowed to protect their industry from disease with the assumption that their concerns are really motivated by a simple attempt to reduce competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only need to look at how difficult it has been for people to prove that a chemical that causes cancer should not be used in shampoo or that dieldrin or heptachlor should be banned and not required to be used by all householders on an annual basis to see how difficult that might be. In the shampoo case, toxicologists were tied up for 10 years fighting corporate chemists, trying to prove that a type of cancer that only occurs in relation to a specific chemical was actually caused by that chemical. After it was finally accepted, the company replaced it with a virtually identical chemical. The toxicologists were back in court for another several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked to prove positively that a diseased organism has the potential to infect our animals or plants. We are being asked to prove that this is the case where the organism may have been processed or treated in some way. We are being asked to prove that, in principle, processing or treatment does not render the organism safe. We are asked to ignore the evidence that there are sometimes problems of compliance. The poisoning of several people recently through eating smallgoods is such evidence. These products are usually safe when prepared or treated properly. That did not stop the poisoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle that a thing is safe until proven unsafe has never really worked to ensure safety. That is why public health, safety and quarantine regulatory agencies around the world have moved to what is called the precautionary principle. This principle states that where there is doubt, the emphasis should be on protection and the burden of proof should be on those who claim there is no problem. Under the World Trade Organisation, this principle has been reversed and we have all agreed to it in this chamber, except for us and the Democrats.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked that because, although we have been told by this government that we are to have a transparent system and that we are to see what is going on, I think the community is quite cynical about whether this will actually occur. We need to know what it is that the government is putting an enhanced monitoring system in to observe. The government has told us that enhanced monitoring will be established and there will be people in the forests checking and monitoring. We need to know: monitoring what? We need to know what the licence criteria are, exactly what the boundaries are, what the harvesting conditions are and what state information has been provided to the government to enable it to make these decisions.

But even when I spoke to her on the phone, if she had put it in the context in which it was conveyed to her, it would have been on the basis that AQIS had prepared a draft risk analysis with regard to the importation of Canadian and American Pacific salmon into this country. The responses and submissions it has had following the period of time for public input are to be assessed and, if there were a requirement to conduct further scientific work as it related to Australian waters, you would not expect to get a decision before the next federal election.

<PARA>The issue of whether the Democrats have a mandate for many of the things which we raise in this chamber, either by way of private member's bills or by way of amendment to other matters before this chamber, has often been raised and particularly rather vehemently by newspaper editorials. Let me point out that on this particular occasion if anybody has a mandate for what we are proposing this afternoon it is the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeatedly in recent times we have seen surveys of Australian public opinion and over a considerable period of time, ever since the French first let off their first weapon, we have seen that the vast majority of Australians, well over 85 per cent of Australians, are opposed to the French tests. These surveys also show that not only do Australians oppose the French tests but also they oppose the export of uranium from Australia. They also have very strong views in relation to the very weak response by both the government and the opposition with respect to these tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a mandate. We have a very strong mandate from the people. We ask: where is the mandate which the government has claimed for its very weak response? I have here the most recent poll conducted by Research International Australia which shows that 96 per cent of Australians are opposed to the French tests. Indeed, that is reflected across the world. It shows that some 61 per cent even in France are opposed to the tests. Some 95 per cent in New Zealand are quite strongly opposed to these tests. Indeed, not only do we have a mandate from the Australian people but we have a strong request from all the people in the world that we use every means at our disposal to prevent these tests. That is why this matter is urgent and that is why we have sought the suspension of standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Chirac has said that our uranium finds its way into French bombs. `Why', he asks, `do we continue to supply uranium for this purpose if we are so opposed to the making and testing of nuclear weapons?' Senator Gareth Evans has called President Chirac a liar. Why then should Senator Evans believe President Chirac when he says that France will permanently and completely stop nuclear testing and enter into a comprehensive test ban treaty once this series of tests is over? If you do not believe the man with respect to one aspect of his claim in relation to nuclear bomb making and testing, why should we accept his view with respect to another aspect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a move which the majority of Australians want.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has said on many occasions that if we were to ban uranium exports to France, France could get uranium more cheaply from Kazakhstan than under these long-term contracts with ERA.

The correct time for such bills to be brought forward under our arrangements&mdash;arrangements which, in some instances, the Australian Democrats have forced upon us&mdash;is on a Thursday. That is when those of us who are not in the government get an opportunity to introduce and have debate on private member's bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an arrangement with the Australian Democrats to ensure that they get a fair share of those Thursday debates. That is the arrangement for bringing on a matter of this nature. It is a pity that the Australian Democrats do not comply with the structures that they have voted to apply to all other senators. I agree that, in exceptional circumstances, the program can be rearranged, which leads to the issue of the merits of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some worries with Senator Coulter's proposal because it seems to me that it would do no damage to the French at all but would benefit them. At the moment, the price of uranium on the spot market is considerably less than under existing Australian contracts. If the Australian government forced the Australian supplier to break the contract, the French would respond gleefully. If we are seeking in some way to punish the French, why would we act to reward them? There must be some logic somewhere but it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps one of Senator Coulter's colleagues will explain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the ledger, of course, is that the Australian company, if we forced it to break its contracts, would no doubt have an action in damages, and the damages would have to be paid by the Australian taxpayer. What we have here is Senator Coulter looking for the Australian taxpayer to pay damages to an Australian company for breach of contract, while the French respond gleefully and welcome this action which will enable them to get their uranium from elsewhere at a cheaper price. So if Senator Coulter's motivation is in some way to apply greater pressure to the French&mdash;which is what we would be seeking: pressure to desist from their nuclear test program&mdash;then the proposal that he has, on the face of it, certainly will not achieve that and, in fact, will be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the urgency that Senator Coulter is arguing is that in some way by acting upon his private member's bill we would be applying greater pressure upon France, then that case is simply not being made out. If it were the case that these sales that are taking place at the moment could have been used in the weapons that are being tested at the moment, then you might be able to at least develop an argument. But we have assurances&mdash;and I accept those assurances&mdash;from the Australian government that that is not occurring.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make to Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is this: ordinarily, the opposition and minor parties have used the time available for general business on a Thursday to deal with these sorts of matters and, to be fair to the Australian Democrats, that is part of our routine of business that they have not used in the sittings during 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did have a close look just a moment ago at the matters that have been raised during general business time this year, and I noticed that on no occasion, in fact, did the Australian Democrats propose a matter to come forward for debate. There have been three clear occasions in the 14 sitting weeks we have had where that general business time has been utilised by the government. There was one other period of general business, on 9 February, when both government business and opposition business were discussed, but on no occasion has a matter been identified for discussion by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Democrats that it is more appropriate, obviously, for such a private members bill to be dealt with during general business on a Thursday afternoon. It is not uncommon, and I think all senators would have to accept this, for a debate of that nature to come forward during general business time. There are plenty of opportunities for these sorts of matters to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very unfortunate that this proposal has come forward at a time when there is such a significant backlog of government legislation for us to deal with. We started these sittings with a legislation program of some 60 packages of bills. Four weeks into these sittings, there are still some 50 packages to debate. If time is to be taken of the Senate to debate a private members bill, it would be a great deal more sensible to utilise the time that is made available on our sitting program to deal with such propositions, and that is during general business on a Thursday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most senators in the chamber would agree that, in the last couple of sittings, we have had a woefully inadequate amount of time to deal with government business. A tremendous number of stunts have been pulled in the Senate chamber over the past few months, and there has been a hell of a lot of politicking in this place. The sort of concentration that one would expect on the government's legislation program has not been given by this chamber. At the rate we are going, judging by our performance to date during this last session, we will be lucky to deal with half of the legislation that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposing a suspension of standing orders at this time ought to be identified as a stunt. I appeal to senators&mdash;the Democrats have a good record in understanding the need for orderly conduct of business in this place&mdash;on this occasion to oppose this motion, because it certainly does not provide that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will of course be supporting the motion to suspend standing orders to urgently debate the Prohibition of Exportation of Uranium to France (Customs Act Amendment) Bill. Although the urgency currently centres on the French, China has been testing this year and the US, Russia and the UK all would not mind having a go at the kind of thing the French have announced and in fact carried through. It would be open slather for the nuclear arms race, and current disarmament rhetoric would stay just that&mdash;rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe Australia should not be exporting uranium at all. Australia currently sells uranium to Japan, South Korea, Sweden, France, Spain, the UK, Belgium and Finland. We would like to see the mining contracts of ERA and Western Mining with companies such as Cogema cancelled and legislation to stop the government giving away uranium stockpiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand why the Australian Democrats have written this bill in the way they have. It closely mirrors existing ALP policy to expose the hypocrisy of a government that will not even support its own party policy. I urge all Labor Party senators to take note of this paradox and vote according to conscience, not party line, else they will be guilty of betraying their own party yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government response to the French nuclear tests has been completely inadequate. Ordinary Australians feel the same way. It is something that nobody has stopped talking about. The main thing the government has to do if it is serious about not being part of these tests and the aspirations of France to remain a strong nuclear power is, instead of tinkering around the issue, ban all sales of uranium to France and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has the government got the means of doing this? This is a fine legal point. With GATT, the national interest clause and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, there may have been a trade-off, a sell off, of our national interests. Has the government got the political will to ban uranium sales? It is not just a matter of the government doing intergovernmental deals to sell the uranium stockpile. It would also be an important matter to stop our two uranium producers, ERA and Western Mining, from selling uranium direct to nuclear nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that an issue like this exposes the stakes that other countries have in the sale of our uranium. Australia sells France 280 tonnes of uranium per year through ERA. France owns 8.3 per cent of Energy Resources Australia directly via nuclear fuel cycle firm Cogema, which is owned by the French government. Cogema also owns most of the two other firms, Saarberg Interuran and Urangesselschaft, which also have large shares in ERA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, ERA had a direct contract with Cogema for 125 tonnes per year as well as contracts with Saarberg Interuran, 75 per cent owned by Cogema, for 250 tonnes per year and for 100 tonnes per year with Urangesselschaft. These contracts with Cogema were negotiated after the institution of a testing moratorium and should have been cancelled with the announcement and the resumption of the testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The damage done to our economy by banning uranium sales would be minimal. ERA has for a number years been selling uranium for less than it costs to produce. The French decision to resume testing is just one more reason for Australia to cease uranium mining altogether and withdraw completely from the nuclear fuel cycle. Australia is a major contributor to the spread of nuclear weapons in France, the nuclear weapons states and nuclear powered countries with nuclear weapons aspirations. Giving countries nuclear technology is akin to giving them nuclear weapons potentials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last eight years, the federal government has given permission for enough plutonium of Australian origin to be separated for the construction of 250 nuclear weapons. Since 1986, the Australian government has given permission for spent nuclear fuel containing 327 tonnes of Australian origin uranium to be reprocessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safeguards do not work. One of the major problems with safeguards is that accounting methods used in large-scale reprocessing plants are able to account for only about 97 per cent to 99 per cent of the plutonium separated from nuclear fuel. The small amounts that are not accounted for are significant because only small amounts of plutonium are needed to construct a nuclear device. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a large scale, the figures are alarming. A large-scale commercial reprocessing plant such as La Hague in France handles approximately 800 tonnes of spent fuel a year. After a year of operation, the loss is enough for 24 kilograms of weapons usable plutonium. Eleven kilograms of weapons usable plutonium is enough for a bomb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These kinds of problems have led to major problems in black marketeering of uranium, of which Australian origin uranium would be a source. It is very clear that the only thing Australia can do to keep itself free of blame for nuclear testing in this region, for providing the material to test weapons and for adding to the international nuclear arms race and nuclear fuel cycle, is ban uranium sales. This is urgent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action that Senator Coulter is undertaking follows a series of questions, petitions, notices of motion and the mounting pressure that the government assured us it was adopting in its stance regarding what the French are doing. The government assured us that it would conduct an escalating program of opposition. This is another stage in that. We are using whatever parliamentary devices are available to us to support the petitions, the postcards, the letters, the personal messages, the boycotts and the visits. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know of the international travel that has been undertaken by MPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action is in support of and part of&mdash;it is not the best or only action by any means&mdash;the continuing strategy. For anybody in this place to deny its urgency is to be hypocritical about any of the other tactics and moves that have been undertaken. By not discussing this at the moment, we are thumbing our noses at international politicians and at the unanimous opinions that have been expressed through Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter mentioned the most recent poll of 27 September. That provides us with the knowledge that 83 per cent of New Zealanders opposed the tests, as did 79 per cent of Australians and 71 per cent of French. Yet here we are, thumbing our noses at that and denying the opportunity for those sorts of people to be represented in a continuing action in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that we should wait until Thursday so that everything can be nice and neat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about assurances, we heard Senator Hill very meekly agreeing with the assurances of Senator Gareth Evans that Australian uranium was not used in French weapons. There are no such guarantees. No guarantees have been given to this parliament. Despite persistent questioning from Senator Bourne, the foreign minister has not been able to guarantee that. He has not given us any guarantees because such guarantees are impossible. The Democrats first revealed that in this chamber in 1989 in relation to the flag swapping deals that had been done to move uranium around, to make the uranium that is used in both weapons and fuel for power generation a generic substance. It is not possible to keep it separate and it is not possible to determine whether there is any Australian uranium in French weapons. Yet we had Senator Hill blandly standing there agreeing that whatever Senator Evans said had to be right and that therefore there was no point in opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had Senator Evans responding to my recent questions as to what he had done to determine the true story of whether French military flights took place over US airspace. I asked what he had done to determine whether what was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> on that matter was true. He had done nothing.

Thirty-one per cent of people believe that the Liberal and National parties have the right policies in relation to the environment compared with the Australian Democrats, who enjoy 13 per cent support, which is less than the `unknown' category of 17 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that we are discussing today is unemployment, and we will have all sorts of furphies and excuses from government senators on the other side. But unemployment, the shortage of paid work, in Australia today continues to be one of the major problems this country is facing, just as it continues to be one of Labor's greatest failures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is running at 8.2 per cent, seasonally adjusted, for August. This means that officially there are about 755,000 people who are unemployed&mdash;three-quarters of a million Australians devastated, disillusioned and debilitated by the soul-destroying situation of failing to find meaningful full-time employment. Each one of those is an individual&mdash;not a statistic, not a number, but an individual: a young person looking for a job, a woman looking for a job, an older man who has been thrown onto the scrap heap. I repeat: there are about 755,000 individual Australians who are unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;is hidden. The official figure is just the tip of an iceberg&mdash;an iceberg created by Labor's failed policies, an iceberg made up of Labor's deceit, an iceberg made up of hidden unemployment and hidden underemployment. Labor needs to get real.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating said to small business, `This is as good as it gets.' By saying that to small business, he is saying to the Australian people also that this is as good as it gets for them because small business employs the majority of people in this country. So if this is as good as it gets for small business, then this is as good as it gets for people looking for work. So this is as good as it gets. Labor needs to get real&mdash;to stop hiding behind the contrived and totally false figures, because this alarming iceberg will sink Australia and take an army of unemployed with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the size of the iceberg? What is the size of that hidden group of people underneath the tip of the official figures? There are over two million Australians who want more work than there is available&mdash;over 2 million people who say, `We are willing to work for more hours than we are able to get.' That is the size of the problem, and the size of the problem highlights the amount of hidden unemployment and the amount of underemployment which exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Labor government with its various accords and its relationship with the ACTU, the praises of which Mr Keating will be singing today&mdash;and I think Jennie George has forgotten that she is no longer No. 3 on the Senate ticket in Victoria; she now is to be president of the ACTU. Not every member of the ACTU is a staunch Labor voter. If Jennie George is to represent the workers of Australia through the ACTU, she ought to remember that. She ought to put aside her party politics and represent those workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always agreed that there is a place for unions in this country, if what they do is represent the real interests of workers&mdash;not those who are attempting to get false benefits for themselves&mdash;in achieving real and proper working conditions. Jennie George ought to have gone into the ACTU and demonstrated that she could do that in an unbiased way. But she has not done that. In her first appearance on a television program she indicated that she was there as a member of the Labor Party. I hope that today, as she takes on that new role, she thinks very carefully about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU, in concert with the government, has given Australia the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. That is what we reached; that is what we achieved. What we are seeing now is the backwash of that highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rigidity of Labor's industrial relations system discourages employment and in many cases, like unfair dismissal, actively discourages businesses from employing people on a full-time basis. My young brother, who is 24 and now managing part of my father's family business, rang me the other day and said, `You can't put people on because you can't sack them if they steal something.' That is a 24-year-old who wants to employ someone. You cannot put people on because you cannot dismiss them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses are not willing to employ people on a full-time basis. They will take on casual labour; but they will not employ people because the unions and the government's legislation have made it so difficult for them to actually take people on in good faith. The government and the unions are denying employment for hundreds and hundreds of workers in this country who are prepared to work, and work cooperatively with employers. That is what they have done. They have destroyed the opportunity, because employers are not willing to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will no doubt get up and crow about jobs growth; but this will not deceive the Australian public. The number of people in full-time work is still less than it was five years ago. What is more, statistics on long-term unemployment released on 15 August this year showed that there has been no decline in long-term unemployment over the previous seven months. These long-term unemployed people have been dumped like flotsam in the wake of the recession that we had to have. They are the victims of the recession that we had to have&mdash;Mr Keating's recession. They are the people who have been left in the wash of that recession like flotsam, with no job and no hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of Labor to address the totally unacceptable level of real unemployment and long-term unemployment is not only creating a trail of human tragedy but also producing an enormous bill costing billions of dollars to Australia in benefits, allowances and subsidies. We also know that the unemployed are more likely to seek help from doctors and are more likely to be ill. Not only is it a cost; it is also a tragedy for them. These are the people who cannot get work and want to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is there an army of long-term unemployed; as I have said, there is also an army of people who want more work and an army of people who are the hidden unemployed. How is Labor hiding the unemployed? When you look at those official figures do not forget that in 1994-95 over 98,000 unemployed people were placed on benefits, which removed them from the standard JSA and NSA statistics. </PARA>

Sixty-three per cent of people do not have a job three months after they have been on jobtrain; jobstart&mdash;it is a bit better&mdash;37 per cent are unemployed; job clubs, 60 per cent do not have a job three months later; job skills, 60 per cent do not have a job three months later; special intervention, 70 per cent do not have a job; accredited training, 65.5 per cent do not have a job; LEAP, 60 per cent do not have a job; skillshare, 60 per cent do not have a job; and OLMA, 51 per cent do not have a job.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing Senator Kay Patterson's matter of public importance. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued failure of the federal Labor government to address the problem of unemployment, in particular the unacceptably high levels of hidden unemployment, under employment, youth, rural and regional unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Patterson has conveniently ignored that we have come out of a recession with a worldwide problem of unemployment, and Australia is better prepared than most other countries as a result of the policies that this government has put in place. That is in sharp contrast with what happened when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer. Unemployment was over 10 per cent in this country. When he left office there were 158,000 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full-time work. Today there are 91,000. That is a stark fact. I was here in 1983 and before. I remember very well the situation that existed. People were not being helped to get back into employment; they were not being trained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Senator Patterson mentions hidden unemployment. It is particularly ironic that the coalition mentions hidden unemployment. If participation rates were the same today as they were when Mr John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, was Treasurer, then our current unemployment rate would be five per cent&mdash;five per cent, if we use the figures, the statistics and the standards of John Howard when he had the opportunity of running this country. You cannot make any comparison at all, because under John Howard people just gave up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a hopelessness that was reflected in the debates we had in this chamber. People did not even bother entering the system because despair was the order of the day when John Howard was the person who was controlling the purse strings and the policies in this country. Countless thousands of women have benefited from Labor's initiatives in the period that we have been in government. I take up Senator Patterson's suggestion that you do have to look at the total picture. I certainly will look at the employment policies of our government as part of the overall economic and industrial relations atmosphere that exists in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ask the question: what would the opposition under John Howard do about employment? They will not really tell us. He is asking the Australian people to vote for him, but he does not have the decency or the courage of his convictions to tell them exactly what they will be voting for. What we do have is the nitpicking that has been characterised by Senator Patterson's contribution of trying to undermine the picture we are painting here&mdash;for people to be able to take their place in employment and come back into the work force in a properly codified way where there is industry training and career paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the opposition at this very moment is following a policy which is the old election policy revisited. Already we have the chaos in economic terms that this will give us. We have the question of overtime rates, penalty rates, penalties for weekend or night work and holiday leave loadings, which will all be under challenge. If wage and salary earners exercise their democratic rights in relation to those industrial relations issues to which Senator Patterson referred, they will be punished and have those rights taken away from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought that Jeff Kennett's impulsive, destructive industrial relations policies were disastrous, but we now have Premier Court's Western Australian model to show us just what would happen under a coalition government: it would be survival of the fittest. The opposition's offer of Jobsback is largely intact, with only a shift in the opting out provisions and the jettisoning of the electorally disastrous and completely discredited youth training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that in July this year Peter Reith, the shadow minister, said that the real barrier to work reform `is the intervention of the commission or the right of intervention by trade unionists who do not have a member on a particular site'. Senator Patterson has alluded to that again today. It is the nub of the industrial relations policy of the coalition. They would remove the rights of unions to intervene before the commission. This not only has the effect of hurting unemployed people who are aspiring to work at a proper rate but also undermines the rate of work for employed people going from job to job and employed people generally. All the resources of the employer are with the employer. He or she has those resources but, unfortunately, the person applying for work or the person in work will be undermined by those policies that a coalition government would follow. In other words, it is a law of the jungle situation where the employer has all the advantages and the person in the workplace has all the disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any level of unemployment is too high, and I agree with Senator Patterson that that is a serious thing. This government has an aim to get unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000, and I hope we will never accept five per cent. The reality is that we have achieved the targets that we have set in bringing down the unemployment figures. Every time that the opposition has said that we would not achieve the figures, we have in fact achieved them. For example, total unemployment fell by 140,000 in the 12 months to June 1995. That is almost a 16 per cent drop in unemployment. Total long-term unemployment fell by 74,000 people&mdash;almost a quarter&mdash;in the same period. The OECD forecasts that unemployment will be at eight per cent in 1996 in line with budget forecasts. Our approach is not piecemeal. We have a progression there based on a whole range of policies which we have put in place that are working consistently to reduce unemployment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We address every area of the problem. We do not use unemployment, as the coalition would have if it had won office at the last election, by shoving people into $3-an-hour slave labour. Whatever variant the coalition finally comes up with, we will be developing our policies based on a fundamental integrated approach. We want to develop the human capital of this country. We are making sure that there is an integration between the education and the training of people to be able to deal with the changing workplace that they will be going into. That is what we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to go back to the Howard years of a low skill base and a policy that does not deal with issues in an integrated way. We want the total picture. We start off with our basic building block of secondary schools. More young people are staying at school longer. When we came to government, three in 10 people stayed at school until year 12. Now the figure is eight in 10. That is the difference between us and the opposition. That is one of the key building blocks which will ensure that young people will have a future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is post-secondary education, apprenticeships and training. Significant TAFE increases have occurred. The government will spend $1.55 billion on vocational education and training between 1994 and 1997. Next year the Commonwealth funding of TAFE will provide an extra 300,000 places over and above what the states and territories provide. We have a similar picture with universities. As I pointed out before, John Howard said that we could not create half a million jobs in three years; he said that it could not be done. The target was reached a year early, and this government has created 630,000 jobs since the last election. John Howard says that we will not get the unemployment figure down to five per cent by the year 2000, but clearly we can and we will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance submitted by Senator Patterson relates to `the continued failure of the federal Labor government to address the problem of unemployment'. I cannot agree that the government has continually failed to address that problem. There have been a number of situations in which the government has attempted to address this problem. Whether they have successfully resolved the problem and whether their addressing of this problem has been useful is a different question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Senator Troeth and I took part in an SBS program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS>, which considered the question of whether Australia could achieve an unemployment rate of less than five per cent by the year 2000. The government was represented to some extent by Mr Langmore, a member of the House of Representatives. He was not keen to be described as the government representative, but he was there. There were 50 others there. They expressed concern that the government could not achieve that aim unless changes were made to several things&mdash;not the least of which was the way in which labour market programs are heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One participant, who was a representative of the armed forces, spoke of the difficulty of recruiting young people to our armed forces. The dozen or so young people who were there unanimously rejected the idea of working for the armed forces, even though the government is spending a huge amount of money on recruitment advertisements for that same employment prospect. That illustrates the difficulty that the government has. In many instances, the areas of traditional employment or the areas which might seem to be areas in which young people could be enticed to develop a career are not those areas that attract interest. The government is also spending a large amount of money on the labour market programs, and some of these are not the most appropriate offerings. Senator Patterson is right to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that an average of 60 per cent of the participants remain unemployed after taking part in jobtrain, jobskills, jobclub, LEAP and skillshare types of programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee, of which I am a member and which is inquiring into long-term unemployment, has considered the question of removing people from unemployment benefits, or whatever the payments are, and putting them into these sorts of schemes. It is particularly looking at the long-term unemployed people who are no longer part of the unemployment statistics but who, subsequent to the completion of such programs, do not join the ranks of employment. That changes the statistics with regard to long-term unemployment. It confuses the analysts. It is not providing an accurate picture of the profile. However, that is not to say that they are all wrong. During that SBS program, I complained that many of the labour market programs, as I have just said, did not necessarily recognise the areas of interest and the areas of growth in our employment opportunities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Crean has shown that he recognises these areas of growth and interest with his recent initiatives with regard to youth employment strategies. He was telling youth that they have the power and an opportunity by giving them multi-media access to more information. I think that must be acknowledged as a step in a direction which I think is important&mdash;that is, to recognise the huge growth in employment opportunities in the areas of arts, recreation and entertainment. After all, we only need to refer ourselves to those who are often described as the richest Australians, whether it be Mr Packer, Mr Murdoch or others involved in those industries, and ask ourselves: are they industrialists or are they people who have invested and reaped the benefits of their investment in entertainment and the arts? That should indicate the direction in which we should invest further facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment in those areas is something which has taken a long time to reach, but now we see some tentative steps. I have to acknowledge that some tentative steps have been taken in that area by Minister Crean. I have faith that this is an area which will reap great rewards for Australia because if there is anything that we have an actual advantage in it is in those areas, particularly in recreation and entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not so long ago California was described to me as having the world's fifth largest economy, based mainly on sunshine. The sunshine had facilitated the development of the entertainment industries in Hollywood. That is a significant component and a major reason why a great number of large international entertainment industries are located there. We have similar comparative advantages and it is about time we recognised them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention one particular group in this context. Last year I sponsored a visit to this place of the Rip'n Tear Theatre Company. I know that Senator Harradine knows something of that group and supports it in its endeavours. This theatrical group was established in Burnie in Tasmania and works essentially with young offenders and helps to increase their self-esteem. I acknowledge Senator Denman in the chamber, who has also supported this group in the past. These people are given the opportunity to develop their talents, skills and self-esteem in learning the craft of theatre and learning what opportunities they have to express themselves and also to develop their capacities in this area of increasing employment opportunities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support of such groups throughout regional Australia could provide great benefits to this government. We do not have enough investment in such strategies. Another group called Big Hart, Big Art is a proposal to establish in regional Australia the infrastructure to enable the development of our young people's talents in the arts. If Mr Murdoch is investing several hundred million dollars in film studios in Sydney, I can anticipate a great growth in this employment opportunity area. That is one thing that the government should address and develop. I will not condemn the government outright for not having done that. It should recognise that this is the area of growth and continue investment in it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued failure of the federal Labor government to address the problem of unemployment, in particular the unacceptably high levels of hidden unemployment, under employment, youth, rural and regional unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon I would like to focus on the question of youth unemployment. It is a very serious problem. Currently, youth unemployment stands at about 26.3 per cent, although young people have constituted as much as 40 per cent of the unemployed Australians in the earlier part of this Labor reign. By way of comparison, the general level of unemployment supposedly now stands at about 8 1/2 per cent. I say `supposedly' because I take up the issues that my colleague Senator Patterson mentioned earlier about the iceberg. The level of 8.5 per cent constitutes that iceberg that is above the water. The rest of those people who are unemployed are hidden in other areas under the water. That is the problem and that is where we are at today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this Labor Party can do is take out full page advertisements, on the one hand accusing us of not having an industrial relations policy and then, on the other hand advertising the pitfalls in that policy. How can you possibly have it both ways? The contribution, albeit from you, Mr Acting Deputy President, when you were not in the chair, was quite remarkable. You focused not one skerrick of your attention on the real problems associated with unemployment, the real problems associated with young people and the ramifications of those high levels of unemployment. The reason for those high levels of unemployment generally and, in particular, youth unemployment, is that the government has allowed small business to be ground into the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sent so many primary employers in this country to the wall. It has taxed the rest to death and continues to tax them. They simply cannot afford to employ people. Once again, as Senator Patterson said, they cannot afford to employ them and they cannot afford to sack them. The fact that youth unemployment has remained more or less three to four times the national average of unemployment is an absolute scandal and should be something about which the government is deeply ashamed and doing something to rectify. Is that happening? No, it is not. The fact is that the lack of those policies to help young people has increased the issues of homelessness, poor health, suicide, illicit drug use and crime, just to name a few. Once again, there is no demonstration of concern amongst the members of this government and there is certainly no will, wish or desire to correct the policy mistakes that have led to these dreadful statistics that we now see. </PARA>

In fact, the number of young teenage males out of work had actually increased since Working Nation. So what is the government doing about it? Working Nation has not worked. Is there something that it has in the pipeline to rectify it? The answer is clearly no. I will be interested to know whether or not the following speakers from the Labor Party have any contribution to make in the way in which it is going to solve this.

Young people today cannot find housing that they can afford. The accessibility of public housing is simply not there. In many cases, understandably, public housing is allocated to families before young people. The other issue of housing affordability is to buy, which is something that is just getting way out of the reach of young people. They have not been able to secure full-time employment, they do not have any security in the employment that they have and, therefore, they simply cannot budget and look at the purchasing of a house. Housing prices and interest rates have just gone up and up and further and further out of their reach, while they simply cannot get work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am waiting, Senator Patterson, for the figures which you say indicate that Working Nation does not work. Let us look at the effect of Working Nation on women&mdash;that key group of people who are usually referred to when we are talking about hidden unemployment or underemployment. Working Nation introduced policy measures which have greatly improved women's access to labour market assistance and is reducing the barriers which many women face when seeking work. The most important of these changes are those to the social security system, which embody the principle of the independent entitlement of spouses to income support.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there is a recognition of their caring responsibilities. Those spouses, mostly women, who have dependent children are eligible to apply for the new parenting allowance. If these people choose to look for work, they can still register with the CES and, if assessed as being at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, they will receive immediate access to case management and most labour market programs. What programs would the opposition keep in place? They will reduce funding to programs under Working Nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the issue of youth unemployment. Working Nation provides better access to entry level training opportunities and early intervention assistance through the youth training initiative. Structured entry level training is essential to assist the transition from school to work for young people. Traineeships, for example, have extremely high success rates in placing young people in worthwhile and sustainable jobs. This will interest Senator Patterson: currently, 88 per cent of all trainees who complete their training are in employment or further education and 85 per cent are in unsubsidised employment three months after completing their traineeships. So they are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the government's commitment to training, there are more young people participating in entry level training than in any of the previous three decades. Working Nation also focuses&mdash;and this will interest Senator Knowles&mdash;on young people who are homeless or at risk. We are not just talking about young people who want to buy homes but young people who cannot get into homes. The case management arrangements introduced under Working Nation have brought a new deal for unemployed young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integration of the case management arrangements developed under the job placement, education and training pilot program into the youth training initiative and jobs compact provides direct access to expanded resources for assisting unemployed homeless youth into education, training and employment and linking into the mainstream programs, providing options not previously available to young people. Another area highlighted by Senator Patterson was regional unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">Today we are discussing yet another one of Labor's failed policies for Australia. We are discussing the matter of public importance raised by Senator Patterson, which is the continued failure of the federal Labor government to address the problems of unemployment, particularly in certain areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often hard to decide just which area of the economy Labor has failed most. Record levels of foreign debt, record interest rates, record current account deficits, record high inflation and record bankruptcies are all hallmarks of the Hawke and Keating Labor administrations. Earlier in the debate today Senator Childs blamed things that happened 13 years ago. For God's sake, when is this Labor government going to look at some of the things that they have done to cripple Australia in the last 13 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Jacinta Collins just talked about Working Nation and how it is working. That is the problem. We have about two million people who are not working to their full capacity, who are unemployed or who are underemployed. Senator Childs and Senator Jacinta Collins talked about the Accord, but there have been no sustainable long-term jobs created by this Labor government in the last 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the cruelest failure is the total failure to come to terms with unemployment and to give young rural people an opportunity in life. It is cruel because, with each new budget or policy statement&mdash;and we have had 20 or so of those in the last 13 years, and Senator Childs should realise that&mdash;there have been promises of another new job scheme and another plan to reduce unemployment. As we all know, despite the rhetoric and the multitude of white papers, green papers and Working Nation statements, is that unemployment is still unacceptably high, as is underemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also cruel because more than 50 per cent of those who participate in jobstart training programs remain underemployed or unemployed three months after completing the scheme; some going through the program repeatedly without success. It is cruel also because one in 10 of Australia's children and dependent students are growing up in families directly scarred by unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the rate of unemployment is not the official 8.2 per cent because, in the collection of official statistics, even people who have worked for only one hour a week are counted as employed, for statistical purposes. The real number of Australians seeking work is about two million, including nearly a quarter of a million discouraged job seekers who have given up bothering to register for work; those working a few hours a week but wanting full-time work; and young people who stay at school because of the lack of job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those living in the metropolitan areas, the underemployment and unemployment crisis in rural Australia is perhaps not as well known, but within country towns and on farming properties it is a major crisis and one of bitter frustration for parents and young job seekers alike. It would be a lucky country town that has unemployment of eight per cent, because the average is somewhere close to double that percentage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of Labor Party policies has impacted heavily on rural Australia because whole towns have closed and services have been removed. Banks, service stations, shops, real estate businesses and chemists&mdash;some towns have lost all those services. In some cases that means there is no chance for apprenticeships for young people. The young people have gone to the cities. That is the real indictment on this government&mdash;the drain of good young people to the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the trend of employment in the rural sector, it has fallen from 6.9 per cent of the work force in 1982-83 to below 4.9 per cent today. It has declined every year the Labor government has been in power. Yet this sector is still expected to produce some 33 per cent of our export income, with only about 4.9 per cent of the work force to produce it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales in recent months we have suffered the double Labor whammy, with the Carr government outstripping their federal mates in decimating industry and killing off job prospects. This has happened in the forestry industry, where Mr Carr has admitted that about 50 per cent of direct jobs in the forestry industry in New South Wales will be lost as a result of his government's forest policies. In the Coolah Tops area, near where I live, there will be 26 people lost out of the timber industry, which was the main manufacturing industry in the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales the position with respect to job opportunities for young people in rural areas is desperate. In the Richmond electorate on the north coast of New South Wales&mdash;an electorate which has been held by the Labor Party for the last five years but which, I suggest, is not going to be held for much longer by the Labor Party&mdash;there is a youth unemployment rate of nearly 29 per cent; 29 per cent of the young people in that area have not got a job. In the central west of New South Wales and across the north and north-west of New South Wales the figure is nearly 33 per cent. How in the heck members of the Keating Labor government can accept that as fair and as giving an opportunity for young people, but still blame somebody for something that might have happened 13 years ago, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a small town like Lithgow, in the central west, there are presently over 1,000 young people on JSA, NSA or training allowances. In Lismore the figure is nearly 4,000. In Murwillumbah there are another 1,500. In Tweed Heads it is nearly 3,000. So the list goes on. Chances are that the great percentage of those people&mdash;many of them young people with no work experience&mdash;will stay on benefits. Under the current policies of the Keating Labor government they most probably will never get a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, as with all Labor governments, fails to recognise that to get unemployment down you need to foster the necessary conditions for growth and investment. We need genuine industrial relations and workplace reform. We need to encourage business investment and provide a positive and confident environment in which business can operate. We need to take the monkey off the back of business, with reduced taxation and the removal of other unfair and unnecessary imposts that have been put on the Australian people, put on the Australian work force and put on the unemployed people by the Keating Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">Later I will be seeking leave to have a graph on structural unemployment incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to help illustrate what I am saying today. This graph shows unemployment has been rising steadily over the last 25 years. There are fluctuations. As the line on the graph shows, we are currently seeing unemployment decline. In spite of this, we see clearly the trend over the last quarter of a century has been that each cycle sees unemployment reach a higher level during recessions and during the maximum employment period. Unemployment is higher than the last such period. The result is a steady increase in unemployment generally from about 1.5 per cent in 1970 to about eight per cent today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term for this type of rise in base level unemployment is structural unemployment. Structural unemployment is caused by the way industry employs people and by the globalisation of trade which sees more labour intensive industries go to countries where they can get an advantage by exploiting people who cannot get a decent return for their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area mentioned in this matter of public importance is that of underemployment and hidden unemployment. ABS state that in September 1994 there were 500,000 people officially underemployed, as well as 830,000 officially unemployed. Roughly 60 per cent of the underemployed were women. In other words, we need to add another 60 per cent to the unemployed figure to get the number who are officially looking for work or for more work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that I only have four minutes, I will change direction. Both major parties have been pushing strongly for structural reform in industry and for the so-called efficiency and productivity measures that basically mean job shedding and work intensification. Labor has consistently delivered wage restraint, which means the real value of wages has gone down. The coalition push for what they euphemistically call deregulation of the labour market and competition within the labour market. This generally translates as union busting and slashing of wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Structural unemployment is caused by a failure to distribute the benefits of productivity increases. The benefits of real productivity gains, if distributed, would mean people working fewer hours for the same wage, with products becoming cheaper. Instead, it means companies employ fewer people and increase profits. The higher level of unemployment is then used to bring pressure against workers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">False productivity has also been pursued. An example is the use of recorded waiting lines for Telstra. Keeping customers on hold for up to 10 minutes may allow fewer staff to be employed and assure that those staff are constantly responding to calls for their whole shift&mdash;it therefore increases profit&mdash;but it is not productive or efficient to keep large numbers of customers tied up on hold waiting for a response.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of those customers could be more constructively engaged if they were not waiting on phones. What is happening here is that time, often paid time, is transferred from the customer's business to Optus or Telstra or an increasing list of businesses that are able to get away with contempt for ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competitive pressure does not seem to address these issues. It makes them worse as companies try to cut costs by shifting them from labour. The presence of Optus has meant that Telstra and Optus compete in staff minimisation. The high unemployment rate is due to the failure of both major parties to deal with basic issues of distribution of benefits of social and technological change. It is a consequence of changing social relations under the development of global capitalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, we have to start looking for regional solutions. Whilst this will not immediately create the employment required, we have to start looking at moving away from the direction we are going, which is making us more dependent on the internationalisation and less able to meet our own needs, including the needs of people for a decent wage and conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of June this year, Australia increased its quarterly growth rate a further 0.1 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is the cornerstone of creating jobs. Putting it simply: we have been increasing the share of the cake so there is more to go around. Meanwhile, the government has been restricting its own spending in order to keep interest rates down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This economic environment brought about by our policies and coupled with Working Nation programs, which have been outlined by Senator Collins, has brought about real results. In the 2 1/2 years since the election, this government has created 675,000 new jobs&mdash;385,000 of those since Working Nation was put into place. In 1994, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed fell more than in any other year. Even more importantly, long-term unemployment dropped 23.4 per cent in one year. This is particularly heartening in relation to young people. In the age group 15 to 19 years, long-term unemployment dropped 22.1 per cent, and in the age group 20 to 24 years, long-term unemployment dropped 38.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means is that the government is taking this approach: firstly, it is making the total cake bigger, it is growing the economy; secondly, it is taking less of the cake itself, it is showing fiscal responsibility; and, thirdly, it is giving a bigger share of the cake to those in the community who need it most&mdash;the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed&mdash;by providing employment programs through DEET to assist these people in getting back to work. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Controversy regarding commentary about the newspaper expertise of AIN, which was contained in the December 5 minute, has been canvassed at length by the Committee. However, the Committee has failed to recognise that as an Australian entity AIN was not an applicant for foreign investment approval. Accordingly, that information was not of any consequence in determining the "contrary to national interest" test in respect of the two foreign investment proposals covered by the minute. Those foreign investment proposals, from Tourang and the O'Reilly Group, were dealt with on their individual merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not Government policy to deal with foreign investment proposals with a view to eliminating competition for Australian bidders. To have done so in the Fairfax case could well have resulted in the Australian sellers receiving less than a fair value for the asset.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say a few words about the government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media. When I read the government's response this morning, it brought back some memories about just how politically charged and contentious this print media inquiry was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that this was an inquiry that cost some $150,000 of taxpayers' money. It lasted for six months and the sole purpose of that inquiry was to attack the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to draw inferences about alleged impropriety&mdash;but, of course, no evidence existed of such&mdash;and to provide a platform for certain senators to gain media exposure which they otherwise would not get. Of course, today we have the same sorts of strategies revisited in terms of the foreign debt and we see the same sorts of populist sentiments attempted to be whipped up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, Labor senators took the view that the appropriate committee to evaluate the operations of the Foreign Investment Review Board was the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee. I maintain that that was the correct view at the time, and that is the case today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we saw a committee which operated in a highly political manner. It was very biased and, in fact, its proceedings were, I think, fairly described as outrageous. We saw a chair who sought to prejudice the inquiry from the very start. We saw a chair who sought to influence the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to give balanced coverage to John Hewson. We saw Liberal senators leak reports and recommendations to the media before they were addressed by the committee and we saw totally biased views expressed in terms of unauthorised press releases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps more disturbingly, we saw a process which enabled the opposition to harness the powers of the Senate to run a vindictive, amoral and malicious campaign to undermine the integrity of many people within this country. We saw a long list of people, including public servants, government ministers, and ordinary Australians, who were abused, assaulted and threatened through this committee, people such as the Prime Minister, Willis, Dawkins, Hawke, Kerin, Pooley, Hinton and Roberts to name just a few. We saw the outrageous attacks upon the civil liberties of those citizens. In my view, this demonstrated the grave dangers posed by the Senate committee itself when it was used in this way. This went to the very heart of fundamental democratic principles which I think we ought to be upholding in the Senate, which we did not do through this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw further interference in civil legal proceedings through various lines of questioning, germane to the litigation which was under way throughout the proceedings of this committee. We saw the threats of punitive action being taken against witnesses who would not give the answers that some senators on this committee thought they ought to. We saw the threats of gaol to public servants. We saw the suppression of legal advice obtained by the committee. We saw the denigration of citizens' reputations through the work of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It strikes me that, in terms of the majority report which the government has responded to, there was complete disregard for the evidence and it predictably came out with views which were prejudged from the beginning and which were critical of the government. There was no evidence of any deal between the Prime Minister and Conrad Black. There was no evidence to support the alleged impropriety of officers of the Foreign Investment Review Board. It was very interesting to note the way in which the opposition sought to use this inquiry to maintain a position on foreign investment which is completely contrary to its own position up until that time. We saw gross political opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the present Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, said in 1986:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time has come for Australians to abandon totally all foreign investment restrictions and to abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board.</PARA>
<PARA>We saw at the time of the Fairfax sale the present spokesman for the opposition on media matters support Conrad Black's takeover and do so publicly. We saw the present Liberal policy summed up by John Howard when he said in the House of Representatives in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will live to regret the day we were equivocal about foreign investment, because those investors will go to other parts of the world and increasingly they're starting to do that.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that members of this place will in future go out into the community and argue the case for foreign investment, even though it is not popular in some sections of the community, and show a bit of courage, a bit of leadership, and persuade those people in the community that their sentiments on whatever those sentiments are based, are sentiments that if implemented in terms of policy, would do this country very real and very lasting damage.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in summarising his position, in his view, he was an `unrepentant internationalist'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is essentially what the Liberal Party policy is today, but we would not know that formally from any stated position other than that which is dripped out of various letters and the like. I recall back in April 1994 Mr Downer said he would be announcing the coalition's policy soon after the Senate inquiry released its final report on the takeover of the Fairfax newspaper group. We are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a view echoed by the Liberal leader at that time. We saw in the majority report a whole series of recommendations which were designed to ensure that the Democrats came together with the opposition to bolster its position on that committee. No sooner had that report been handed down in the Senate than Senator Richard Alston made it very clear at a press conference that as far as he was concerned the print media report did not bind Liberal Party policy. He said that this report's recommendations did not bind the coalition party room&mdash;a similar position, I might say, to the one that was taken in regard to the ABC committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the government's response, it is very good to see that the government has responded to the minority report in the manner that it has. It is pleasing to note that there have been significant changes in terms of the operations of the Foreign Investment Review Board. I think we will see a much clearer view expressed in terms of its operation which will, in my judgment, lead to a very big improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has moved to introduce a more proactive consultation process in the examination of foreign investment proposals in regard to advertisements to be placed in major newspapers and invitations for public comment. The public comment will be taken into account in assessing applications. The government has also moved to implement a more forthcoming announcement system in regard to press releases on all major approvals and rejections and orders under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be more frequent reporting on the issuing of FIRB quarterly monitors, which will highlight emerging trends and provide valuable statistical information. Perhaps equally importantly the government will expand a monitoring system to ensure wider compliance of FIRB actions and decisions. These reforms are welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also address issues of greater flexibility for regional newspapers as recommended in the minority report. In my judgment, these will improve the level of media diversity in provincial Australia. It is a very simple proposition that where there is only one newspaper there is only one view. I take the view that there ought to be much higher levels of diversity and media ownership in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures come on top of a whole raft of proposals that the government has introduced to basically improve the level of diversity and to promote, at the same time, a viable media industry within this country. On 27 June a range of measures were announced to tighten the cross-media ownership regime in this country. I could go through the detail but time is against me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, what I think needs to be analysed in this discussion is exactly what is the coalition's policy. We do not have any clear statement other than its view that there should be open slather for foreign investment, other than that there should be effectively a regime which would allow the resources of this country to be carted off by the truck load, other than an opportunity for its friends to essentially take control of the media in the country in a way which would prevent diversity and which would lead to an undermining of our national culture and our national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask again: what is the coalition policy? When will we see it? We have been promised it again and again. What are they frightened of? Why don't they come forward? One can only presume that they have something to hide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following that farrago of nonsense, I would like to come back to the facts in relation to this government response. The response is to a Senate inquiry that was established in December 1993 in response to considerable community concern about Mr Conrad Black's description in his autobiography of a deal with Mr Keating to allow Mr Black to increase his investment in Fairfax if his political coverage of the 1993 election was `balanced'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also in response to Mr Keating's public comments on the record which supported the notion of a deal with Mr Black. It was also in response to considerable concern about the Foreign Investment Review Board processes leading up to the Fairfax decisions made in 1991 and 1993. So there was very considerable basis for having the print media inquiry which this Senate conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government did was exercise its utmost energy in disrupting the inquiry, frustrating the inquiry and intimidating senators on the committee. Despite all that, the Senate committee was able to present its report in June 1994. What that report did was expose Mr Keating's attempt to blackmail Mr Black over his ownership of the Fairfax newspapers. Of course that stood up to all attempts by the Labor Party to deny that. It rang true with everything we know about Mr Keating and his hatred of the Fairfax newspapers&mdash;a hatred which continues today and which was so gross that it brought him into the chamber the other day to complain about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>'s article in relation to his sensitivity about his bald spot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also found that Mr Keating did attempt to influence Mr Black regarding the political coverage of the Fairfax newspapers for the 1993 election. Now, 15 months later, 12 months after the due date for responses to Senate reports, we receive this government response. I have to say it can only be described as a pathetic response. It is grossly inadequate. Frankly, it ignores all the major issues raised by the Senate report. My colleagues Senator Alston and Senator Ellison, who were with me on this inquiry, will be responding in some detail to this government's response when they have an opportunity to speak tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind the Senate that the print media inquiry committee's report exposed the unacceptable way in which our very loose foreign investment guidelines can be manipulated for partisan political ends. Those partisan political ends, in this case, clearly had nothing to do with the national interest, which is what should drive foreign investment decisions of this kind. I want to refer to independent evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Bowman, a writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS> newspaper, who concentrates on media issues, wrote some very interesting articles about this whole matter. At the time of our report he said the following about our committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the committee had enough witnesses and enough evidence available from the public record to be able to produce a valuable report, lucid, closely reasoned, damning of some individuals and their actions, and proposing reforms in the foreign investment procedures to make it more difficult for governments to misuse the processes for their own political advantage when the national interest was supposed to be their overriding consideration. The evidence against the Prime Minister was more than enough to justify the conclusion that he tried improperly to influence Fairfax newspapers by holding out to Conrad Black the prospect of increased investment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an independent commentator in an independent newspaper in Adelaide saying those things&mdash;not me, not anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without labouring that point, I note that the report made recommendations&mdash;sensible recommendations&mdash;to clean up foreign investment policy in this country to ensure that no Prime Minister of whatever colour or of whatever party could in future be in a position to seek to influence a media proprietor in the manner in which Mr Keating sought to influence Mr Black in relation to the ownership of Fairfax. It must be said that even the Labor members of the committee, including Senator Carr, acknowledged the need for a much more open, independent, transparent and accountable approach to the regulation of foreign investment. </PARA>

There is a clear need for an independent foreign investment commission to act as a regulator not merely a processor of applications. The government's response to this particular recommendation is really quite contemptuous. All they have to say is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Foreign Investment Review Board provides an additional source of advice to Government and makes recommendations. It is not a regulatory body and nothing positive would be achieved by making it a statutory body.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government is dead wrong.

It would mean that there would be greater certainty about the foreign investment rules and guidelines. There would be much less likelihood of partisan manipulation by one side of politics or the other. There would be much greater openness about the foreign investment process. There would be more effective regulation once conditions were laid down for foreign investment&mdash;because, as Senator Carr would have to admit, at the moment there is absolutely no regulation of the commitments that foreign investors make as part of their approvals. Obviously, there also would be greater independence of the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be a number of people speaking on this issue tomorrow, and I really feel there are a number of points that need to be clarified. If I could mention some of our concerns and then ask some specific questions, that would be helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the requirement that a proprietary business must have a throughput of $10 million per annum, or 50 employees or assets in excess of $5 million, would ensure that small businesses and most medium businesses are excluded. I note that even a relatively large variety grocery store such as the Foodland or the Four Square type stores would not have volumes of this level&mdash;a group of those stores might, however&mdash;nor would they have that many staff in one place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industries that might be most affected are low volume, high value businesses. They also include high value technical industries. They are likely to have few staff and relatively few creditors. They would possibly be eligible for a discretionary exemption. I guess part of the question is: what kind of guidance will there be for the discretionary exemption? That seems to be a great deal of the concern that was mentioned to me, perhaps for an hour, over the phone last night from one of the callers who spoke to me about how a discretionary exemption might be administered. How would one company know that the kind of exemption that was available to a similar company would also be available to them? Do they have to fight their case all over again, and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a large volume, low profit margin company, this seems to be a very major point of concern. Whilst I can understand that there is more likelihood of an exemption being available to low volume, high value businesses&mdash;such as machinery companies or companies selling trucks or tractors and so on&mdash;they also, ironically, would probably have the lower end of the auditing cost because the sheer volume, or lack of volume, of sales would make it easier to check the books, whereas it is the large volume, low profit margin companies which would probably suffer most from such an audit in terms of the actual cost to their business. If they were on, say, a two per cent margin and if the type of business were, like in Canberra, a chain of three hardware stores or so on, then the actual impost on them to check back on all of the items they sell would be huge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would they be likely to qualify for an exemption because of the cost? What are the likely benefits that would be expected from that kind of check? Could the minister provide some examples of private companies suffering financial difficulties which have affected either creditors or employees where the minister feels that the changes under this bill would have improved this position? We need to find out whether there are any instances where having the audit done may, in fact, be of benefit to the company. How do you work out this cost and benefit balance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can understand that exemptions may well be available to those people whose audit costs might be lowest. Exemptions might be a lot more difficult for those companies with a high volume and low profit whose costs would be highest. The problem with the costs is that we are given to understand that, because of changes to federal law, the audit costs are higher because it is extremely difficult for auditors to get liability insurance. Therefore, sometimes costs have gone up threefold to provide an audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government going to put on the record here as to what it might do to mitigate the increased cost of an audit which has actually resulted&mdash;I am not saying it is a bad thing that auditors should be responsible for the outcome of their audits&mdash;from the government's change of legislation, which makes it extremely difficult for auditors to gain liability insurance? We have been told that sometimes three times the cost or more on audits have been hiked up because of these changes. I will throw out those questions now and, if there are other questions that need clarifying later, I will ask them following the minister's response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Margetts for raising these issues. I appreciate that they are issues that might cause concern to some, and it is useful to get the opportunity to put them on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the criteria the Australian Securities Commission would have in determining whether the audit requirements would impose an unreasonable burden, they are specified in our third amendment, which will be scheduled. I will not read them because it will unduly take the time of the chamber. That is the first point. I realise it does not cover all of the points, but that is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that I am advised with regard to these matters that it is the intention of the Securities Commission to put out class orders for public discussion so that people can assess the manner in which this matter is going to be handled. Of course, with regard to each individual company, the ASC's discretion is subject to AAT review, so there is some process of ensuring that it is not unfairly applied in a particular circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to your audit costs question, there are really two points I want to make. The first is that it is true that there are some questions of audit indemnity that have been made more stringent, and some of that dates back to an earlier review of the Corporations Law with which I was involved. I got the impression that you perhaps shared that view that they are changes that were worth while. They do have some cost, but I think that is a cost that has a sufficient community benefit to warrant it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to Senator Margetts's question about the high volume and low profit margin hardware store retailer. I am advised that it tends to be the case that, in relation to the audit procedures&mdash;and this is consistent with the general audit principles that were applied to various companies that I was involved with in a previous life&mdash;involving large volume and low profit processes, provided the processes and procedures of the company concerned are adequate, auditors would always take a sample of transactions to assess. Normally it would be a very small sample, say one per cent, because they would have confidence that taking that sample with a company with good procedures would give them a sufficient level of confidence to conduct their audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the procedure that has been operated. It is not specially to do with this legislation; there is nothing particular about it. That is the way in which we would expect that to take place. I cannot say that it will always be one per cent, of course. That would be at the discretion of the auditor in each case, depending on their judgment about their client. They may feel they need a higher sample because they have less confidence in the quality of the processes and procedures. Of course, that is not something that this legislation can have any bearing on. Senator Margetts, that goes to most of your questions. If I have not covered all of them, please come back and I will try to give you some more information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the minister to clarify that the audit costs are, similar to the cost of tax assessment, fully tax deductible and clarify the procedures under which companies can seek exemptions from the Australian Securities Commission. Minister, you have mentioned the sorts of criteria that will be under the third amendment, but would they also cover the procedures by which they might seek exemptions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the first point, there is no doubt in my mind that such expenses will be tax deductible. Firstly, in the normal course we would expect those expenses to be tax deductible because they are incurred in the normal course of earning income. But I understand that there is a tax ruling, although I have not seen it, which makes that quite specific. That they would be tax deductible just seems to me to be straightforward, Senator. I can give you that confident assurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the process, the main process for application would be covered by the class audits where the ASC would say that certain types of companies are covered, and then they would not need to apply. But, if they were not in one of those categories, they could still apply to the ASC with regard to their particular case. Each company could make an application, though those covered by the class audit would not need to. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These businesses already go to their chartered accountants to obtain a balance sheet so that their income tax can be assessed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could be a Democrat. I am sure that, if he were a Democrat, he would be equally as worried. Mr Bolger has allowed me to table this submission from his accountant, Tognola Cabassi McCallum and Co. Mr Tognola says to Mr Bolger, in a letter dated 13 September:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We refer to our recent discussion regarding the Corporations Law Simplification Bill. Under the proposed legislation, we consider that your Group would be classified as "large" because it satisfies two of the three criteria set out in the proposed Bill.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly the accounts of the Group would need to be audited with the first audit probably occurring in respect of the year ended 30 June 1996. We estimate the fee for performing the audit for your group of companies, given the diversity of locations etc would range between $20,000&mdash;$30,000. This cost is considerably greater than what you are currently paying our firm for attending to the traditional accounting work that we perform which goes hand in hand with the compilation of the Group's income tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe Mr Bolger is already paying these people $9,000, and he will have to pay an additional, say, $25,000. This is a business which employs about 60 people. Mr Bolger is already paying a firm of accountants to do his income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen if this legislation goes through is that Mr Bolger's company will be assessed as being big and he will have to provide to the Australian Securities Commission his annual accounts, which are the profit and loss account, his balance sheet, directors report and the auditors report. Not only will it cost him an additional $25,000&mdash;I take the mean between $20,000 and $30,000&mdash;but details about his business will be made available to any of his competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Mr Bolger's businesses involves the industrial removal of garbage. He is an industrial cleaner. There is fierce competition in that sort of business, such as from Cleanaway, Hunter Bros and a number of other people. When he lodges all those documents&mdash;his balance sheet, the directors report and the profit and loss account&mdash;with the Australian Securities Commission, this will leave him wide open to anyone to come in, get an understanding of his business and offer him a takeover fee or establish a business. All his books will be laid open for anyone to come in and examine. He will have lost any commercial-in-confidence papers that he previously had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must take that into consideration. I know the Greens and the Australian Democrats have a commitment to privacy. That right will go right out the window. I seek leave to table the letter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler said today that this kind of auditing will be of some assistance to business. If auditing was of assistance to business, what happened to Skase, what happened to Bond and what happened to all those big companies that crashed in the 1980s? They all would have been audited. It does not do one iota of good. Accountants for businesses of any size must do a profit and loss account, a balance sheet and then a tax form and send that to the taxation department, so already small businesses are getting enough information for their taxation to run their business properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that&mdash;we can go around in circles about this&mdash;for some small businesses, $30,000 will be the straw that breaks their backs. This will certainly hurt many companies that are now exempt, particularly the smaller big businesses. A lot of times when they are getting up to the 49 mark and they want to put on a couple of people, they will not do so. I know that a lot of people do a similar thing in relation to payroll tax. They know that if they have only eight or nine people working they fall beneath the bar of the payroll tax, so they do not put another person on. They just make do with the people they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You raised some questions about getting exemptions from the Australian Securities Commission. Those exemptions will be arbitrary and at the discretion of the Australian Securities Commission. I do not believe it is in the best interests of Australia that we in this Senate make laws that allow government departments or semi-government departments&mdash;it is government departments in this case&mdash;to take the power out of parliament and make discretionary or arbitrary decisions. People then have to go and prove their case and spend huge amounts of money to do so, and they have to get accountants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran, who was on the committee and did put down a minority report, will probably explain this more fully, but it is arbitrary. That does not mean the Australian Securities Commission is going to allow it to happen. It means that they have power under the act to do so if they want. No-one knows what the barriers will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think they do, Senator. You may be able to tell me, but I cannot see any reason for this Senate to impose an additional cost of between $25,000 and $30,000 on businesses in Australia. We go out there and we all&mdash;every person in the Senate does this, from the National Party to the Greens to the Democrats&mdash;pay lip service to small business. It is a huge voting block and we all say that we are for small business. It is like motherhood. We are all for motherhood and we are all for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is one bill through which we can say to small business: `We know you are doing it tough, we know you have had a rough time paying 18 per cent to 24 per cent interest rates, we know you have survived and we admire you for employing people and for your spirit in staying in there when 40,000 small businesses have gone broke over the last four or five years.' But surely we, as a Senate, do not want to go in with a bill called the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and use that bill, which is supposed to assist small business, to put another 13 pounds in the saddle and draw them out on a wet track. That is what we are doing. We are placing them right out on a wet track, putting weight in their saddle bags and telling them to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses have had so much trouble surviving in the last five years with high interest rates and every other imposition placed on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to reply after each speaker because it will wind up extending the debate, but I want to respond to some of the points Senator Boswell made. I will be brief because other senators will want to speak and we want to try to get this through as quickly as we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is clear that the accounts that will be required to be lodged simply will not go into sufficient detail to allow the sort of competitive information that Senator Boswell raised that opens people up to takeovers, et cetera. No-one is going to make a takeover bid on the basis of the sort of generalised information that is required under these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point was in regard to small business. It is not that people introduced this measure ignorant of the concerns of small business. We know that the people who suffer when these companies fall over, or when their suppliers and subcontractors and others fall over, and therefore get the knock-on effect, are small businesses. The people who predominantly lose&mdash;sometimes it is employees, of course&mdash;who will be benefited by this are in fact small businesses, the people who contract to, supply and become the creditors of these people who fall over without warning or without effective capacity for people to judge that this might be imminent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the question of cost, I have before me an Institute of Chartered Accountants' survey of their members, which assessed that the estimated additional cost would be in the order of $12,000. That is, of course, a deductible $12,000. I do not want to say that that is irrelevant, but it is certainly much less than the figure Senator Boswell was quoting. I am not saying that the quotes are not accurate, because it may be the case for one company and I cannot, of course, comment on that. We are talking about an average over all the clients of about, in this instance, some 700 chartered accountants who responded. So we are talking about a smaller burden, a tax deductible one&mdash;but not nothing. I do not say that it is irrelevant to individual companies, but it is less than Senator Boswell was discussing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the question of the manner in which this discretion is going to be exercised, it is in the same way that all decisions that are properly passed by this Senate are constrained. They are constrained by legislative criteria and administrative law requirements. That is, we will be legislating in amendments to set down the criteria that will apply in the amendment that the minister circulated and people will be accountable against those under the normal administrative law requirements of the Commonwealth. So it is not just an arbitrary discretion. It is one with legislated criteria and reviewable discretions exercised and accountable against those criteria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I want to say first of all how much I welcomed your declaration of an interest in this matter yesterday, when this debate started. I think it is a very proper way to conduct ourselves. I do not think we should rely simply on the statements that are filed, in our case with the Senate, where we as senators are obliged to declare our interests. I think there is an obligation on all of us whenever we debate a matter in which we have or may have an interest and where there is potential for conflict. I think it is proper that we should declare such an interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that I have no conflict of interest in this matter. I am not a director of any proprietary companies and stand to gain no benefit whatsoever from any change in this matter. This situation may not have obtained some years ago, but on coming into parliament I think I joined the great bulk of my colleagues in having a much lower level of income than I had outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make another couple of points. I will endeavour to be brief on this matter. Firstly, I take note of what the minister said. I agree with him about the question of the benefits that are given to people who set up companies, the benefit of limited liability and I agree with him on, as a consequence of that, what one does to try to ensure that as few people as possible who deal with such companies are damaged by inadequate laws in this area&mdash;in other words the subcontractors, who may be caught when a company goes broke. That they should be protected I think is a sound point that should be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many small companies benefit from the rules applied to other companies. One only has to look at the building industry to see the large volume of building subcontractors who work their hearts out, provide buildings which are then used by the ultimate customer, with the builder in the meantime having gone broke and many of the subcontractors, who often have been underpaid, as a consequence, also going broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's reasonable approach to this and other matters underlines the point that he is too much of a gentleman and is foolish to be leaving or at least endeavouring to move from&mdash;I think is the appropriate expression&mdash;this chamber to seek fame, and certainly not fortune, in another chamber of this parliament. We will be doing all we can to endeavour to prevent that move, not because we would particularly like to see him continuing here but because we do not want to see him in the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Minister, the point that you make is one which is shared by the opposition: it is important that people recognise that they receive a benefit when they are allowed to limit their liability by the use of the corporate structure. There is no doubt that in this area it is important for there to be a level playing field&mdash;and I know that is an unfortunate expression these days; somehow people think that a level playing field is something nasty. But a level field in this area represents fairness and even-handedness, and it is important that a level playing field exist within the corporate structures, particularly amongst competing proprietary companies. This is where the government's attempt to correct the situation has broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that what the government is seeking to do&mdash;which is to remove an immense burden on small proprietary companies&mdash;is excellent. I am not disputing that. But why I am supporting the opposition's amendment is that the government is now, in fact, making it grossly unfair for some large proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a new distinction. If you are a small proprietary company, you are absolved from the great burden of reporting requirements&mdash;and we commend that. But Senator Boswell has outlined the criteria by which you are deemed to be a large one: $10 million of turnover, $5 million of assets and 50 employees; if you qualify with two of those, you are hit with the new arrangements. The problem is the government has said that, if you are a large company which hits two of those requirements, you face not a level playing field but an unfair and discriminatory playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens is that up until now you may have chosen to have your accounts audited and, therefore, under the old rules, not been obliged to present in public details of your financial statements. In other words, the form you have filled in has allowed you to tick a box which has said `Are your accounts audited?', you have ticked that and said `Yes', and you have not had to reveal anything. On the other hand, if you have not ticked the audited box and you have not had your accounts audited, you have been obliged to reveal the details of your financial accounts&mdash;the key financial data. That has been the position until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government now going to do? The government is going to make it unfair. In future, under this legislation, the government will say, `Well, if in the past you have been ticking the box, for whatever reason, that you have had your accounts audited, you can keep on ticking the box and reveal nothing,' because the government for some reason wants to grandfather that requirement. Those who have been ticking the box in the past have to reveal nothing. Those who for other various reasons have not ticked the box and have revealed their financial details will not be given that option. They will be obliged not only to have their accounts fully audited at additional expense&mdash;considerable expense in some cases&mdash;but they will be forced also to reveal their detailed accounts publicly, as Senator Boswell complained. He was complaining about the very fact they have to do it; I am complaining about the unfair, uneven handling of two competitive proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the government doing this? What is the benefit in public policy terms of unfairly discriminating against one set of companies who happen to have ticked one box and another set of companies who happen to have filled in a form? The government does not know what the reason is. It has not presented a reason, except to say, `Oh well, the people who have been ticking the box saying that their accounts are audited are accustomed to that level of privacy'. That, full stop, is the reason. I have heard nothing more ridiculous in my life. If those people are entitled to privacy, why aren't the others given the option of being entitled to privacy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question is a difficult one. In the days when I would have declared an interest as being a director or having shares in a company, I would have been able to say that, yes, I was a director of public companies which had the misfortune of competing with large proprietary companies. We had to reveal all and the large proprietary companies revealed nothing and, I might say, in many instances seemed to be tailing our pants off&mdash;maybe they were better run than ours. But they had a specific advantage; there was no level playing field there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, this is a question of public policy and the fact remains that a public company does have additional responsibilities, particularly to a wide spread of owners. But a public company has no greater responsibility to people who lend it money&mdash;and most of them seem to borrow more than the amount of their capital these days&mdash;and no less a responsibility towards borrowers than do proprietary companies; and no greater responsibility to people who are lending money to them than proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that we have to see how we can make this competitive arena as fair and as just and as reasonable as possible. That is the reason for Senator Vanstone's amendments which, in fact, say to the government, `Look, you've got to give the same opportunities to all people'&mdash;these are the larger proprietary companies&mdash;`Give them the same opportunities. If they want to have their accounts audited, they should be able to tick the box and not reveal the details; if they do not want to have their accounts audited, they have to keep revealing, as now, the details of their key financial statement.' That seems to me to be the fairest way to resolve a difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some misunderstanding. There has been a strong question about whether or not this is going to impose an enormous cost burden on people. Obviously, if Senator Vanstone's amendments, on behalf of the opposition, are passed&mdash;that is, firstly, allowing them to tick the box or, secondly, put in the information&mdash;there is no additional burden. The fact is that, for the great bulk of large companies also proprietary companies, there is unlikely to be any additional burden because they already have audited accounts and tick the audited accounts box because they do not want to reveal their innermost secrets, they do not want to reveal their figures&mdash;and neither they should, if they do not want to, in terms of a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is that this legislation, even if it goes through in the government's terms, while it will not impose a massive burden on small business by requiring everyone suddenly to employ auditors&mdash;because of most of them at the top end already do&mdash;it will nonetheless impose some burden which may well not be fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is this: if the opposition's amendment is not carried, a series of problems will be created, which I believe this Senate will have to address. If the opposition's making-things-fair amendment is knocked back, we then go to the government's one, which involves a discretion&mdash;giving the Securities Commission, in effect, a discretion to determine whether or not it is right or wrong for a `big company', or in the public interest, or too costly in relation to the benefit in the public interest to reveal all; in other words, to meet these requirements. Giving the ASC this discretion to allow people not to meet it seems to me to be a dreadful way to run a company. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are self-evident. The high jump bar presented in this legislation is not reasonable if we are going to have the government's amendment passed and not the opposition's amendment. It is not reasonable on several grounds. The first ground is that it will include a lot of small&mdash;despite the definition of `large'&mdash;proprietary companies entirely owned by families which are financed entirely from internal family sources, as families have reinvested their money by way of lending and so on to the company, with very little external debt for security. It will involve an unfair attack on those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for that is the wrong inclusion of the word `assets' as one of the criteria. The issue here surely should not be assets. There are a whole lot of versions of how you value an asset. I remember the Keating piggery revalued its assets up by $4 million, not by revaluing the land but by revaluing&mdash;on its own estimates; not a licensed valuer's estimate&mdash;its piggery buildings. In fact, the buildings were steadily deteriorating; one even burnt down. But asset valuation is not the way to go. It should clearly be the level of external liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a review of this high jump level. I will be moving an amendment at the third reading stage to require this situation to be reviewed. I strongly support Senator Vanstone's amendment.

A lot of people will work out who I am talking about, but that is different. It has been reported, I think arising from a separate court action, that one of the directors of the company could not explain transactions involving amounts in the vicinity of $720,000. It is likely that, if an auditor had been appointed to such a company, an unexplained transaction of this nature would have been noted and queried. So there is one example. It is a bit general because I do not want to give too much detail. </PARA>

It had a reported deficiency of more than $5 million, with 150 creditors and $755,000 in pre-paid orders that had not been supplied. At least 10,000 customers have been affected by the collapse of this company. When it failed, the Victorian ministry of fair trading indicated that it had received more than 600 calls in two days from customers who had ordered and paid for goods but had not received them. In this instance, what you would have had with audits is the likelihood of earlier recognition of the problems of the company.

As Senator Baume was saying&mdash;perhaps in stronger and more colourful language&mdash;some made the choice to have auditors; some made the choice to file key financial data.

The government's arrangements are that the great bulk of public companies which tick the box saying `audited' will not be required to show a thing.

His appointment, as this report says, changed significantly following the government's implementation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts' recommendation that a specialist taxation ombudsman should be established. It is interesting to note that, as a result of that appointment, there has been an enormous upsurge in the volume of tax complaints made to the ombudsman. He notes in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for the period April 1994&mdash;June 1994, the office received 191 complaints about the ATO, while for the period April 1995-June 1995, the figure was 529. The post Special Tax Adviser rate of complaint is about 280 per cent that of the previous rate.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although it is difficult to draw strong inferences from this short period, it seems taxpayers are having difficulty with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the ATO's debt recovery actions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.remission of penalties, especially those relating to incorrect returns, underestimation of provisional income and late payment of tax;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.disputes about the ATO's audit settlement practices;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the operation of the provisional tax system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.conduct of income tax and sales tax audits;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I have heard plenty of complaints about those&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the ATO's compliance function in the Superannuation Guarantee area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have not received many individual complaints about the operation of the private rulings system, however we presume this is because taxpayers are not yet aware that we handle these types of complaints.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, they are expecting a fair volume of such complaints. There has been an interesting outcome as a result of the special tax adviser's inquiries into the question of fringe benefits tax and the confusion that had entered this area as a result of government activities and the extraordinary way people were being penalised for genuinely misunderstanding a massively confusing situation. The ombudsman's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO has responded very positively to the Special Tax Adviser's inquiries. The Commissioner provided the following commitment in relation to penalties:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is acknowledged that a number of taxpayers have had difficulty in applying the law in this area to their particular situations. For that reason the ATO will, unless special circumstances apply, generally remit the total culpability component of any incorrect return penalties arising out of errors made by taxpayers in the 1994 and 1995 years of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome that, but it underlines how confusing, complicated and, some people would say, ridiculous some of the fringe benefits tax arrangements have been under this government. This is the government that came in saying that it was going to simplify the tax system when at that stage the tax act was 1,136 pages thick. It is now 3,378 pages thick. It has trebled in size and become much more complicated, to the extent that you now need a special tax ombudsman. But that is simply by the way and I suppose could be dismissed as a political point. It is a matter of some substance. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Special Tax Adviser will be pursuing some outstanding issues related to the public rulings program,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which I welcome&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">including monitoring the ATO's action to finalise old draft rulings and how public rulings are applied in practice, but his focus will shift to the private rulings system where he would be looking at the systemic problems associated with turnaround times for private ruling requests.</PARA>
<PARA>This area of private ruling is a very complicated one and one that does need correction. I am overjoyed to see that the special tax adviser will be looking at this because there has been an upsurge in complaints about debt recovery. I welcome the fact that the ATO's debt management system is also being examined by the commissioner, because there are real problems. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, want to offer some comments on the Commonwealth Ombudsman's annual report, in my case so far as it relates to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The report comments on eight areas within the jurisdiction of the department and the minister. I want to comment on several of those. A constant theme in the complaints received by the ombudsman was delays in processing applications and refusals of visas and entry permits. However, unfortunately, the ombudsman has not covered  this in any further detail in the report other than raising it as a constant theme in the complaints. It is a matter that does require some further monitoring and follow up because it does suggest, at least prima facie, a sloppiness in administration, which we would not want to see continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also complaints of delays in responding to correspondence to the department. The ombudsman pursued these complaints with the department, in many cases because the complaints themselves took an unreasonably long time to resolve. I am pleased to note that the ombudsman believes the situation has improved. Again, this is another area of administration that requires careful monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another item touched on by the ombudsman related to the transfer of immigration detainees to state prisons. The migration legislation allows immigration detainees to be held in state prisons or other facilities authorised by the minister as immigration detention centres. So the law therefore allows detainees to be transferred from immigration detention centres to state prisons or other facilities for behavioural or management reasons. The ombudsman followed up three cases of detainees who were transferred to the prison system. All three were transferred because their behaviour in detention was unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ombudsman supports a recommendation of the Australian Institute of Criminology that only those detainees charged with a criminal offence should be transferred to prisons. It acknowledged that there would be some cases where other reasonable grounds for transfer exist, such as the need to protect other detainees. However, management practices within the immigration detention centres should, so the ombudsman said&mdash;I certainly agree&mdash;be developed to cope with most situations. Failure to monitor and reassess detainees in the prison system was the ombudsman's main criticism of the present situation. But, again, it obviously is an area which requires careful examination, and a considered response from the department is required at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other items which is a matter of real concern so far as the administration of the department is concerned is the ombudsman's comments on the question of refunds and reinstatement for entry visas. In 1987 return visas and return endorsement visas&mdash;multiple entry visas&mdash;were replaced with resident return visas. Because of a major slip-up by the department, a problem has been caused as a result of that. What the government intended to do at the time was to introduce legislation to cancel the two visa arrangements that were being replaced. However, it never got around to doing that; it has never happened. That means that for all permanent residents who have not received a new resident return visa, their old visas are still valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaint that came to the Ombudsman came about because many people who could have continued to travel on their old visa arrangements exchanged them for the new ones without being told they could have kept the old ones. The new resident return visas cost an applicant $50, whereas the former ones were free. Many people&mdash;I am told possibly tens of thousands&mdash;had they known that at that time, would have continued to travel on their old visas. The net result of all this is that the department has agreed there is an inequity and has said these people should approach their immigration office to see whether they are entitled to a refund or have their old visas reinstated.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to address a few remarks to one issue that emerges from this quite weighty report&mdash;report No. 45 into charitable organisations in Australia. The issue is covered in chapter 12 which relates to taxation arrangements of charitable organisations. One particular concern I have had for some time relates to the use of fringe benefits tax and the exemption that is available to charitable organisations from fringe benefits tax. The report confirms the concern that I have had for some time about potential abuse of the fringe benefits tax exemption enjoyed by not only charitable institutions but also some religious institutions, public benevolent institutions and even some public hospitals that are classified as PBIs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out early on, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I, like you, share some concerns generally about the approach taken in Industry Commission reports. But on this occasion I find myself in agreement with their conclusions, at least as they relate to fringe benefits tax. The abuse identified goes to the potential for unscrupulous practices and the unethical use of fringe benefits as some of these organisations have sought to move employees from their salaries onto a combination of salary and fringe benefit provisions. These provisions allow the sharing between the employees and the organisations of the benefits of their exemption from fringe benefits. There is potential for enormous cost saving, I will admit, for these organisations. As most of them are under pressure about their funding and have an unending demand for their services, both the organisations and their employees are under real pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, a range of concerns have been identified by the Industry Commission which go to the inequality between employees that some of these practices have encouraged, and the enormous cost to the Commonwealth, which the Industry Commission estimates at $40 million currently and with the potential to extend greatly as the pressure for and knowledge of the ability to use the fringe benefits tax loophole spreads throughout this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the concern that these arrangements are not necessarily transparent nor used properly in terms of the costing of services. There is also the serious concern that I have, which is that the whole arrangement can have the effect of undercutting the award system and the proper rights of employees to award conditions. The pressure that can be applied in terms of having to find savings in budgets can force employees into agreeing to fringe benefits tax arrangements which may not be in their interests and certainly may not be in the interests of the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission identifies these concerns and concludes that perhaps the exemption ought to be removed. I am sure the government will give serious consideration to the whole report. I do not want to pre-empt any decisions that need to be taken when dealing with the totality of the report, but it is of concern that the Industry Commission has identified abuse and unscrupulous practices developing in charitable organisations and other organisations that benefit from this fringe benefits tax exemption. It fits with my concerns about the abuse by the Western Australian state Liberal government of those fringe benefits tax exemptions within the remuneration packages that they are offering to employees of their public benevolent institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the developments in that field, and with the developments identified in the Industry Commission report that are occurring in charitable organisations, there is a justifiable concern that the Commonwealth is losing revenue and that unequal and inappropriate practices are developing in relation to the avoidance of fringe benefits tax. I think it is something that the government and the parliament ought to give consideration to dealing with and ending the abuse that is occurring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must agree with Senator Chris Evans. I have those concerns. But I say to Senator Evans that one of the problems is that your government has already put out a press release that says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also does not accept that the fringe benefits tax exemption for charitable organisations should be removed.</PARA>
<PARA>So while I have those concerns, it looks as though the government has already cut off probably one of the parts of this Industry Commission report that I really would have thought would have been of great benefit to us, because I share your concerns, having seen what some of the charitable organisations have done in artificially arranging salary packages. I think you should take this back to the government and say to them that despite their press release, maybe that is one part they ought to look at again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have other concerns in regard to which I am not so supportive of this report. Like Senator Evans, I must say it is a very weighty tome. Let me signal a couple of issues. One that I have been concerned about throughout the whole process of this Industry Commission report is the issue of tendering. I raised only last week the problem that has been created in Victoria through the government there tendering out welfare services such as Meals on Wheels and what that has done to the quality, ethos and the very rationale for Meals on Wheels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I signal that I still have a great concern in this area of tendering and notice that this is one of the substantial recommendations&mdash;in fact, it picks up a number of recommendations&mdash;in the report that has remained, despite the fact that it has been signalled by many charitable organisations. Certainly I have indicated  to the government that this is one they should leave alone, although not in a total sense, because there are areas in which it is appropriate, but I think that in most cases it is a recommendation that the government ought to leave alone, despite what the Industry Commission says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I signal a couple of matters that concern me greatly. For instance, in referring to its recommendation about calling applications by public tender, the Industry Commission report says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Joint ventures and prime subcontracting are common features of tender arrangements in other sectors of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>That highlights the fundamental problem that we have had with this whole approach of the Industry Commission. To describe the charitable sector as one of the other sectors of the economy is the whole problem that we have had with the Industry Commission approach. While there are economic implications to the charity sector&mdash;of course, there are&mdash;to describe it simply as one of the sectors of the economy underlines the very problem that I have with the approach of the Industry Commission's whole inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me signal just one other issue, and it is on page 218 of the report. For community social welfare organisations to receive tax deductibility for donations, they will have to separately incorporate under an act of parliament and change their structures. I hope the government leaves this one totally alone. I will tell you what it could mean. It could mean that church aged care institutions that have millions of dollars invested in assets, if they have to pay stamp duty on the value of those assets in order to reincorporate under another structure, could not even begin to cope with that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I am fascinated by this report of the Industry Commission on charitable organisations in Australia, in particular, their efficiency and accountability. This, I think, is the very important element of the report. This report outlines that many of these non-government development organisations&mdash;fund-raisers&mdash;have a national charter and are particularly disadvantaged by interstate disparities and outmoded legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, World Vision of Australia estimates that its compliance costs under state fundraising legislation are at least $1 million a year. That $1 million which should be going in aid is going in compliance costs because of the different state legislation across Australia. As Amnesty International said, and as is quoted in this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major problem for Amnesty International Australia is the inability to run an Australia wide raffle . . . on advice from one of our major legal firms and it is clear that although Amnesty International Australia has a presence in all the State capitals and Canberra, State laws prevent a combined raffle.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to disclosure requirements, World Vision of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . legislative requirements do not recognise that some charities are run as a serious business and do not keep such records in the form that various State legislation requires. For instance in NSW the requirements state that a cash book, register of assets, register of receipt books, register of tickets, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">petty cash book, minute book and register of participants must be kept. In Queensland the requirements state that a cash book, petty cash book, register of receipt books and postage stamp record must be kept. Such requirements from incompetent or out-of-touch legislation discriminate against efficient large scale operations . . . Uniformity, closer co-ordination, would help national charities be more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission believes, in its report, that modernisation and greater uniformity of regulations would have particular benefit for the administrative efficiency of NGDOs. It also notes that there is a high level of interest about the way in which NGDOs raise and spend donations. For this reason, the commission developed ratios which could be used by donors to compare fundraising and program spending performances. I seek leave to table that statement. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a revelation. The criteria have to be taken with some reservation. The one showing the highest&mdash;in other words, the best&mdash;project expenditure as against total expenditure, I guess the lowest administrative and other costs, of the top three listed here is the Adventist Development and Relief Agency, which spends 96.6 per cent of its total expenditure on projects. Then there is Australian Catholic Relief, with 90.8 per cent; and then Care Australia with 89.5 per cent. Care Australia is the top of the non-church organisations. Many of the church organisations have the benefit of having reduced administrative expenses because they operate within the structure of the church.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem is that there is a lack of consistent information on the composition of expenditure and income, which makes it extremely difficult for members of the public to determine how their donations are being spent and to make informed comparisons between them. One donor found, as the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in effect it has not been possible for me as a donor to inspect the financial statement of Austcare, and from that statement to work out how much they're spending on fundraising and administration, and I feel that this shows a lack of accountability which is very close to disregard for the interests of donors.</PARA>
<PARA>I was not particularly seeking to single out Austcare, but it is simply an example of the problems. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As World Vision Australia submitted, there are several ways in which overheads are calculated, reported and interpreted in the overseas aid sector.</PARA>
<PARA>A representative of Save the Children Australia said, according to this report, that he had seen NGDOs quote expenses for administration that they would regard as highly questionable. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present it's very easy, I think, for organisations to do a sort of snow job on their accounts to hide management expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>In any event, this report recommends a significant improvement in the requirements, because it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a broad agreement in the sector that features of NGDOs justify special considerations of accountability for this group of organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>On the face of it, just having looked quickly at these recommendations about greater accountability, I must say that they look sound.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">This is a weighty tome. It would take some time to digest. At the outset I must say that I agree with Senator Woodley's concerns about the requirement for charitable bodies to be incorporated so as to get tax deductibility, which is one of the recommendations contained in chapter 12 of the report. It could have unforeseen consequences, which would be highly undesirable. Quite clearly, that is a recommendation that needs to be rethought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I should state that I have an involvement with a large number of charitable bodies that are involved in fundraising, either educational bodies or bodies for public benefit. One example is Life Education, which is not quite an education body. Another is my rowing club. All of them have problems with fundraising. That was why I was quite interested in chapter 9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the fundraising industry is a substantial industry in Australia today. Some estimates of fundraising put it as high as one per cent of GDP. That does not sound a lot, but that is around $4 billion or more. There is quite a lot of money in fundraising. It is a very big business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems that members of parliament have whenever the issue of fundraising comes up is: what is a reasonable amount of cost to be incurred in the process of fundraising, and what is unreasonable? There is a grave difficulty here because many organisations do not have the in-house expertise in order to run fundraising programs. Sometimes it is more efficient to bring in people from outside to be fund-raisers. In that respect you have to be very careful that, if you limit too heavily the amount of costs that a body can incur in the process of fundraising, they may not actually raise any funds at all. At the same time, people who donate money want to be guaranteed, as far as is possible, that a fair proportion of their money is actually going to the charity which they wish to support. That is the dilemma. I am going to have to look at the chapter in more detail before I form a final view. I believe there is a lot of merit in self-governing of the fundraising industry through the FIA. Ideally, I would like us to go down that track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to taxation arrangements, I was intrigued to read the recommendation that tax deductibility be given to any body which could meet the definition of `advancement of social welfare' contained in Waterson and Others v. Hendon Borough Council (1959) 1 WLR, page 958. I must admit that it has been a long time since I have read that. I will have to go back to the case to see exactly what it means. I do believe that sometimes we are too tight in our definition of what is charitable and, therefore, attracts tax deductibility. I believe broadening that gives the community at large a better choice of how they wish to apply their money. It may increase the level of public benevolence. That is something we have to consider as well. Given, I am sure, that other people wish to speak on this fairly weighty tome, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight on a matter which I regard as a serious deficiency in Australian public life; that is, our lack of any population policy. I am moved to speak on this subject by a recent news report on immigration to Australia in 1994-95. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> reported on 7 September 1995 that figures released by the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research showed a 25 per cent increase in immigration from the previous year. That is an extraordinary increase in one year. What is also extraordinary is that it was largely ignored by the media and by the parliament. It does appear that immigration is, in fact, a no-go area in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 87,428 immigrants in 1994-95 compared with 69,768 in the previous year. The bureau notes that nearly half the immigrants are still going to New South Wales&mdash;43 per cent to New South Wales; nearly twice as many as go to the next highest state, Victoria, which received 22 per cent. I think that is quite interesting in the light of New South Wales Premier Carr's recent comments on the population problems, as he sees them, in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern raised by the latest figures is the fact that such a big increase in the immigration intake has occurred while unemployment in this country remains so high. We had an MPI on that subject today. Unemployment is still at 8.3 per cent&mdash;a very high level. There are still nearly three-quarters of a million Australians who cannot get work but who want it. The economy is slowing down. It is being deliberately slowed down by the government. So the likelihood is that unemployment will at some point start to rise again. Even the government's budget, which one must say is an optimistic document, admits that unemployment will not be less than eight per cent by June next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, in the face of all that&mdash;three-quarters of a million unemployed&mdash;the government is accelerating the immigration program. I am not talking about whether there is immigration or not; I am talking about the pace of the increase in immigration. To have a 25 per cent increase in one year really makes no sense to the Australian community in the face of the very high level of unemployment. It particularly does not make much sense when you note&mdash;as I do not think many Australians do&mdash;that the unemployment rate for migrants who have arrived in the last five years is 22 per cent. That means that almost one in four of recent migrants who wish to obtain a job cannot get a job and are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the unemployment rate for all migrants who arrived in the last 20 years&mdash;that is, since 1976&mdash;is above the national unemployment rate of 8.3 per cent. Yet, in the face of all that, the government is proposing another increase. We see that in 1995-96, the current financial year, the government has set aside an extra 14,000 places, which will take immigration back over the 100,000 mark. I just do not know how the government can justify such a rapid increase in immigration when we still have three-quarters of a million Australians who cannot find work. I really wonder what the trade unions think of all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue, in my view, is that the government is threatening what is fragile community support for a big immigration program by this sort of rapid increase in the intake. I note that the community has really already given up on Labor on this issue of immigration. The Newspoll survey published on 20 September, which sought the attitudes of people to the handling of various issues by Labor and the coalition, showed that voters think that the coalition can handle the issue of immigration better than Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a surprising finding when you look at what has been an extraordinary roller-coaster ride on immigration under Labor&mdash;incredible fluctuations in numbers year by year. The net migration in Labor's first year, 1984, was 49,000; by 1988, only four years later, it was 149,000&mdash;an extraordinary increase in four years. In 1989 it was 157,000; in 1990 it went back to 124,000; and in 1991 it went down to 86,000. It is just like the big dipper at Luna Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former finance minister Peter Walsh was very revealing in his book about the way this government conducts immigration policy. He noted in his book that it took five years of this government before it even had a major debate on immigration. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early in 1988, the first major cabinet debate on immigration took place.</PARA>
<PARA>He then says, in looking back over the five years at that point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus three sequences of blow outs and cave-ins boosted arrivals from 70 to 115 thousand. The next year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is 1989&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the hopeless adhockery of immigration policy which former Labor minister Peter Walsh complained of and which Barry Jones in his own report&mdash;a very interesting report on Australia's population carrying capacity&mdash;complained of. The report is by the National President of the Labor Party, and the committee has a majority of Labor members on it. Its recommendation No. 2 is well worth reading in the light of what I regard as this ad hoc approach to immigration. Mr Jones's committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government should adopt a population policy which explicitly sets out options for long term population change, in preference to the existing situation where a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">de facto</EMPHASIS> population policy emerges as a consequence of year by year decisions on immigration intake taken in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ad hoc</EMPHASIS> fashion, such decisions being largely determined by the state of the economy in the particular year and with little consideration of the long term effects.</PARA>
<PARA>There is your own national president&mdash;the national president of the party in government&mdash;describing his government's policy as ad hoc.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On previous occasions I have addressed the Senate on the failure of government regulatory agencies in the financial sector to actually implement any of the acts of parliament that they have at their disposal. Primarily supervision is considered to be best served by self-regulation. Credit unions are an excellent example where people of common interest can save their funds for common purpose and it is in their best interests. Credit unions are a practical and workable alternative to banks and often more rewarding for depositors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the management of one credit union is destroying the credibility of other respectable, diligent and hardworking credit unions. The management of one credit union is jeopardising workers' savings. What is the government of Queensland doing&mdash;nothing! In Queensland, self-regulation has been reduced to a farce. There is a credit union in Queensland that has behaved in a cavalier manner with depositors' savings&mdash;a credit union that is appearing before the Senate Committee of Privileges and is involved in a tax minimisation scheme for its general manager's superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Professional Credit Union appears to be an exceptional case of the failure of good corporate governance in credit union affairs. Unfortunately, they have been  advised on the tax minimisation treatment of the general manager's superannuation by KPMG Brisbane and they have on their board a Mr Des Boyland&mdash;no novice to superannuation affairs having spent considerable years as the trade union representative on the Queensland State Government Superannuation Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless, however, of their accumulated wisdom, the board of the Queensland Professional Credit Union converted the accrued long service leave and annual leave of the General Manager, Mr Rutherford, as a direct deposit to his superannuation. Just in the game of monopoly when you are on the way straight to gaol, they did not have to pass `Go', they did not pay income tax, they did not pay stamp duty, they did not consider whether this was equitable, they did not treat all of their employees equally, and they did not seek a ruling from the ATO on this highly irregular move. They went past `Go' and collected their benefits on the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is now an ATO ruling on this form of transaction. It was obtained by one of the credit union members who is outraged at the blatant rort. It is my view that managing the savings of Australians is not a game of monopoly. Confidence in the Australian banking sector was severely shaken by the regulatory failures of the eighties. Confidence was also shaken by the demise of the integrity of corporate governance. To go some way to restoring confidence, directors must exercise care and independent judgment in their management of banking institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Queensland Professional Credit Union saga, members have seen corporate governance and government supervision reduced to practices similar to that of the rum corp in the early days of European colonisation of Australia. I believe that the credibility of Treasurer De Lacey, the credibility of the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision and the Queensland government's financial institutions code stands or falls on the way in which they discharge their duty to protect depositors from the activities of the Queensland Professional Credit Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a case crying out for intervention and enforcement by the regulators. Yet they sit on their hands and they say they have no evidence. I am told that some of the evidence has been formally put before the regulators three times and that they have now been formally invited to hold an inquiry. I wait to see their response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the members of the QPCU will have to pick up the costs of legal services in defence as well as the unpaid tax bill and fine when it should be reimbursed by Mr Rutherford. To maintain confidence in the savings of credit unions and demonstrate the vigour and independence of the regulator, there needs to be an independent audit of all  aspects of the QPCU affairs over the past years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me finally outline the inequity of this situation. We are aware of the diligence of the tax office in chasing up trivial amounts of undeclared bank interest through the income matching system which monitors levels of compliance in this community. I have heard many stories of pensioners being fined on small amounts of interest inadvertently overlooked and receiving a 25 per cent penalty. These overlooked amounts are in the order of $150 or less and at the low tax rate of 21.4 per cent they gather a minor amount of revenue for the Commonwealth. There is also the case of a student who was disallowed on $250 worth of receipts because they were not proper receipts, despite being claims against Austudy for books and study aids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the transaction I am describing. This one transaction on $77,000 worth of transfer to superannuation from long service leave and holiday pay equates to approximately $72,000 in tax and about $15,000 in interest to date on the late payment, up to $25,000 penalty for non-compliance by the credit union and a further $10,000 approximately for non-payment of payroll tax. This is a considerable sum of money in anyone's terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the Treasurer (Mr Willis) can advise the Senate as to the extent of this practice and what this practice might represent in terms of lost revenue for the Australian Taxation Office. What guarantee do the members of the QPCU have that the taxation department will pursue this revenue from the transaction that I outlined? What guarantee do the members have that they will not have to foot the bill for taxation, reimbursement, legal fees, payroll tax and penalty that this `super deal'&mdash;that is according to the federal Treasurer&mdash;is not on? Will the Commonwealth Treasurer draw these matters to the attention of the Queensland Treasurer Mr De Lacey to ensure that the integrity of the Australian financial institutions code is reinstated and that the workers of Queensland can have confidence in their credit unions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we all know that in politics not everything that happens fills us with delight or joy. It is a tough game and sometimes hard decisions are made. There are also occasions, as we know, when good decisions come forward from government which make you feel that it is all worth while. I believe the decision made last week by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and approved by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to list the drug pulmozyme on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was such a decision. I am delighted that that decision has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About three months ago, in July, I met a young girl called Jodie Collins, a 19-year-old, who lived in my local area, who suffered from cystic fibrosis. Jodie was campaigning to have this drug listed on the PBS list. She had been prescribed the pulmozyme drug since the beginning of the year and was certainly showing signs of improvement&mdash;improvement in that, whereas previously she may have been in hospital on some five occasions, she did not have to be hospitalised once during these months when she was receiving this treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the cost of pulmozyme was around $1,300 a month&mdash;a crippling cost for any patient or their family. Thus it was that Jodie was devoting all of her energies to getting out and being active in the community, urging us, the politicians, and those in the halls of power generally to see whether this drug could be listed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter had been before the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on two previous occasions. The first was November 1994 when the committee considered an application for the listing of pulmozyme. The committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the information submitted, the use of Pulmozyme has only a small measurable impact on the disease for the majority of cystic fibrosis patients. Furthermore, the drug is extremely expensive. In deciding whether Pulmozyme could be recommended for listing as a pharmaceutical benefit, the Committee needed to take into account both the very high cost of the drug and the small benefits demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion the application was denied. A further application went before the PBAC and was dealt with in June of this year. On that occasion more information was provided by the manufacturer and, even though it indicated that the benefits of the treatment for a group of patients that was being trialled seemed to be maintained, the committee did not believe that there was sufficient information before it to support listing on the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health, Senator Crowley, answered a question from me on this matter. There was some criticism by way of interjection from the opposition about why this decision to list the drug had not been taken earlier. It is important to remember that the PBAC is an independent body made up of experts whose very difficult job it is to make these sorts of decisions that require a balancing on the one hand of the best way to assist patients suffering from diseases like cystic fibrosis and whether there will be benefits from such drugs, and, on the other hand, the cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of pulmozyme we are talking about many millions of dollars in cost. I do not think anybody envies the people on that committee having to make such decisions. Frankly, whilst we all wish that we could ensure that every single drug that was of assistance to any patient was available through the scheme, no matter how small the number of people who may ultimately benefit, that is just not possible when those drugs are so very expensive. We have to balance various considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the committee looked at this situation and requested further information following that decision in June and it indicated that it would be prepared to consider it again. Further information was able to be provided and, as time went on, it became clear that around about a third of the estimated number of people suffering from CF were likely to benefit from pulmozyme. In addition, since that decision in June, the drug had been listed in Canada on its equivalent scheme. So there was new information available to the committee when it met recently. Ultimately, as the minister has announced, it recommended the approval of pulmozyme on the basis that it would be strictly controlled by the relevant medical specialists recommending to whom the drug should be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated, it is not something that will provide a cure for all CF sufferers. We are all aware that cystic fibrosis, which is an hereditary disease, is a terrible complaint. People who suffer from it generally have a very short life expectancy. If this drug works, as it appears to do for some of these people, that will be a terrific thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rose to speak tonight because I was delighted to see that decision last week and I know that many of my colleagues across the political spectrum&mdash;in particular, my local member, Robert Tickner&mdash;have taken up this issue. We should look at this decision as being one that represents the positive side of politics&mdash;there are people who will be benefiting from this decision. We also recognise that this was a matter that had to be given the greatest consideration by the committee and, ultimately, by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to Jodie Collins, her family and all those other people who have been involved in this campaign and to the Cystic Fibrosis Association. I finish by quoting some words that Jodie said in an article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past six months, Pulmozyme has allowed me to do all the things I ever dreamed of doing. I can duck dive under a wave in the surf and recently I climbed Mount Kosciusko without too much difficulty. My appetite has improved and I have gained 10 kilograms since my last hospitalisation. Even my doctor is thrilled because my lung function has significantly improved. I now have energy to do what I want. For the first time in my life my body can keep up with my spirit.</PARA>
<PARA>Jodie and people like her have a great deal of spirit and I hope that this certainly continues to assist them in the future.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw, you might not have realised that part-way through that quote your time had expired but we on this side of the chamber indicated to the chair that we wanted you to continue because the quote you read out was quite moving and was indicative of the fact that every political party, every individual in this place, was personally involved in the campaign. I want to place on record my appreciation for the decision that was ultimately made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I rise tonight is to talk about two vital industries in my home state of Tasmania that have been adversely affected by the federal government's indecision and politicking. Unfortunately, the government has been sending out conflicting messages and a great degree of uncertainty has been occasioned. As a result, there is no job security and the potential for growth in jobs has been undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first industry I want to refer to is the aquaculture industry. Today, my friend and colleague from Tasmania, Senator Calvert, raised a question on this vital industry. Senator Calvert, might I add, is a person who has personal experience in the aquaculture industry and has some knowledge of it. He has shown a genuine concern for this industry over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was therefore highly appropriate that he asked a question at question time today that referred particularly to comments made by Senator Murphy. Senator Murphy had basically said that the federal government would not make a decision in relation to the importation of Atlantic salmon from North America until after the federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that sent out all the messages that the people in the industry and, in particular, the employees did not want to hear. They did not want the government to play politics with it. Unfortunately, Senator Murphy let the cat out of the bag by making his ill-considered comments. From our side of the Senate, of course, we welcomed his comments because they highlighted the way that the Labor Party really plays with this issue, and that is to be condemned. I also note that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) administered an admonishment to Senator Murphy for his comments by his backhanded comment in his answer, and all credit goes to the minister for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft risk analysis of AQIS has given a lot of concern to the industry and employees within the industry. Whilst Senator Murphy has sought to gain cheap publicity in Tasmania on a bleeding heart basis, let me simply indicate that when the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee of the Senate was in Tasmania to deal with the question of AQIS there were no Tasmanian Labor Senate representatives. Not a single one of them turned up&mdash;let alone Senator Shayne Murphy, who is in fact a member of that committee. You would have thought that simply from his responsibilities as a senator he might have turned up. Apart from that you might think that, given all his bleatings of recent times, he may have also turned up because of his genuine concern for the Tasmanian industry. But on neither count did he turn up. Let me simply add that both Senator Calvert and I put in appearances to ensure that the appropriate questions were asked and the appropriate information was obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me simply remind the Senate that currently 2,000 people are employed because of the existence of the aquaculture industry, and it produces $100 million worth of product each year. For my home state of Tasmania, it is a very important industry and one that does need to be looked after. From my point of view and, I know, from Senator Calvert's point of view as well, it needs to retain its disease-free status. That is why so much angst has been occasioned in Tasmania by the draft risk analysis of AQIS, which has basically suggested that the importation of North Atlantic salmon ought be allowed with all its diseases and the risk associated with those diseases spreading, not only to the aquaculture industry but also into our native fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I wanted to raise, the other vital industry where various signals have been sent out, is in relation to the timber industry. Many thousands of my fellow Tasmanians find gainful employment through the harvesting of the renewable resource that we know as timber. Let me say that in the Tasmanian context in excess of 25 per cent of our land mass is already locked up. It will never have the chainsaw put to it or even be selectively harvested. It is simply locked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, while the federal government was determining its approach to the forests, in the last few months of federal-state talks leading up to what will undoubtedly be fully announced in a few days time, up to 12 bureaucrats were arriving in Tasmania every few weeks to discuss the environmental issues. The social and economic issues which the government said it would take into account&mdash;the issues dealing with the workers, the families and the communities&mdash;were left to a lone Canberra-hired consultant for a mere three days. Yet it had a dozen bureaucrats dealing with the environmental issues, because placating the green movement is so much more important to this Labor government than looking after the welfare of the workers that it is supposed to represent. It is little wonder that people like Martin Ferguson and others are lamenting the fact that people are leaving the trade union movement in droves and are deserting the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue that I want to raise in this context&mdash;that is, the campaign of hate that is being pursued by the extreme green movement in my home state of Tasmania. In recent times, I had a very moving account provided to me of how a young boy aged about eight or nine came home after school. When his father arrived home after a full day's work in the bush, his son asked him, `Why do you murder trees?' When the father asked his son where he had got this outrageous suggestion from, he said, `Well, that's what my teacher said in school today.' Of course, that child is now being ostracised at school by his other classmates because there is the assertion in the class&mdash;because teacher said so&mdash;that this young boy's father is a tree murderer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we talk about the importance of looking after people's rights and ensuring that they are not alienated, this federal government, in its ever increasing attempt to placate the green vote by funding these organisations, has also allowed a campaign to spread throughout the community which seeks to ostracise those people, those families and those communities that earn a genuine income from genuine hard work, earning genuine export dollars for our country. Let me simply say that we on this side of the chamber stand in solidarity with the timber workers, their families and their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just a few moments left, and I simply digress very briefly to say that I welcome the federal government's decision to recognise grandparents in the Family Law Act, as announced in recent times. The government response initially was to reject the suggestion of the unanimous decision of the Senate committee that looked into that. I then spoke in the Senate opposing the government's response. I understand a lot of lobbying has been undertaken, and the government has now changed its mind. I congratulate all those involved who lobbied the government to make it change its mind. </PARA>
