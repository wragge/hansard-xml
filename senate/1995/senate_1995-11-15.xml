<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This motion relates to the Public Works Committee's consideration of the proposed headquarters for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), who is obviously handling this matter, is concerned about this issue for a number of reasons. On behalf of the government and the minister, let me say that we believe the motion should be rejected but, given the time considerations in the Senate, we will not be frustrating the inevitable evolution of how this will be handled by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot agree with the motion. We agree with Senator Reid's concerns about the broader planning issues for Canberra. However, we believe that her concern about a ban on public servants moving to Civic to replace those who moved to Barton is misplaced. We think the Public Works Committee is a process designed to elicit full public debate. The committee has already commenced its consideration of projects. It has allocated at least a full day this week to consider community and business concerns. We believe that the broader planning issues, including the town centre needs, are being considered by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, time has been allocated this week to discuss those issues. Those issues are important. People should have the right to put them before the PWC this week. We also believe that future adverse impacts can be avoided. We do not believe that further moves from Civic are likely, providing competitive offers are made to tenants. Property rentals are now moving to more realistic levels, apparently as a result of prospective vacancies created by the proposed moves to Barton. The government will set up constructive mechanisms to have a better informed market. This will lead to better results in reintroducing regulation and compulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our view that the alleged planning impact on Barton and Civic is incorrect. The actual impact is manageable. For instance, the number of staff involved in moving these projects from Civic to Barton is 1,450, not the 3,000 quoted. The projects have already met all the required planning guidelines. We are talking about two or more years to adjust. We are also concerned that these projects will have a positive impact on the ACT construction industry, something which Senator Reid should take into account. These projects will create some 500 jobs in the construction industry and we believe that potential workers should not be frustrated in obtaining those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decisions are needed quickly by the interested tenants. It is quite obvious that deferring consideration by the PWC will simply encourage proposed tenants to move to other developments that bypass the Public Works Committee process. As we know, the PWC process attaches to proposals put forward by government and built by government. It does not attach to private sector developers. At the end of the day, if we use this sort of approach to frustrate the planning, building and locational needs of government departments, the direct result will be that people and departments will look outside the public sector for the provision of space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is undertaking development in the new town centres. For instance, DSS will be setting up a regional office in Tuggeranong. I do not want to go on at length on this but those points needed to be placed on the record. We believe this type of action only frustrates potential employees. It does not lead to good property management by government. At the same time, we recognise that there are planning needs to be taken into account. Those needs are being taken into account. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="2945" SPEAKER="Reid Sen M.E." NAMEID="VI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="ACT">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) referred in his closing remarks to property management. What I am concerned about is planning in the Australian Capital Territory, in particular the national capital, and the way it will appear to others. He also raised the question of construction jobs. I recognise that construction is an important part of the local economy, but you don't go on building and building anywhere just for the sake of jobs, because they only last for a few months in any event. Construction for its own sake does not and should not come ahead of planning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are faced with in the Australian Capital Territory is an embargo, effectively, although some might try to say that is not the case, of public servants being allowed to move into Civic. We all know why that came about in the 1980s. I will not take the time of the Senate now to go through a couple of reports that dealt with it, but that is the fact. Times have changed quite dramatically since then and what we are seeing is public servants being withdrawn from Civic&mdash;in relation to the present proposal the number of public servants is somewhere between 1,400 and 1,500&mdash;at a time when there is already office space vacant in Civic. I have already mentioned that we are faced with a situation of not being able to move other public servants into that area. So we are creating a wasteland in Civic. Anything more detrimental to the overall appearance of the national capital you can hardly imagine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am asking for is a halt on this until such time as proper planning consideration has been given to the future of Civic and to the other town centres. I do not believe you can look at one bit in isolation from the whole. At present there are no Commonwealth departments in Gungahlin. I do not know whether there ever will be, but at least it needs to be considered. We already have the impact on Woden of having taken departments out of there and placed them in Tuggeranong and there is space available in Woden. Now there is this massive increase in building in Barton. I believe the infrastructure of that area has not been adequately considered. There are submissions to the Public Works Committee from large organisations in the area which raised the impact on the area of this massive increase in construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence that parking has been adequately considered. The ACT government planning committee has looked at it. There is another motion, which I shall be seeking to move as formal in a few moments, which deals with what that committee found. Perhaps I will refer to that now to save taking a great deal of time later in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference in motion No. 1892 is to the fact that the territory committee found that nowhere in the documentation is there any evidence Canberra's town planning objectives have been considered by the initiating agency or any other Commonwealth body. The minister, in referring to this, has dealt with construction and the needs of public servants; but it is the overall plan that is the important issue and it always has been. That is why Canberra is the beautiful city it is, and we do not want to spoil that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time in Civic the Commonwealth occupies about 310,000 square metres of office space; the ACT government, 50,000 square metres; and the private sector, 90,000 square metres&mdash;roughly 450,000 square metres in total. As to the proposals to move out of Civic at the present time, the Department of Industrial Relations occupies 11,400 square metres; the Australian Federal Police, 10,000 square metres&mdash;and let me say that there is absolutely no reason for them to be moving out of Civic, because there is no problem with their retaining the lease of the building they are presently in a very attractive building and well placed in Civic; the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories occupies 8,500 square metres; AusAID, 11,000 square metres; and the Department of Defence, 15,000 square metres. That is a total of just under 56,000 square metres. To take that many public servants out and to leave that amount of space vacant, when it is not possible to recruit other public servants at this stage to move into that area, would cause a huge impact on an area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I ask the minister to take into account, which I think he obviously does not understand, is the actual role of the Public Works Committee and what they are required to look at. It is not the major planning issues. What has not happened, especially in relation to the building included in motion No. 1889, is that the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories requires a change to the plan before it can go ahead, and the matter has not gone before the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. Even if the Public Works Committee approves that building, it cannot proceed until the joint committee on the national capital has approved it also, and it has not come to that committee as yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another reason why the Senate, as it has, would support the motion that the matter not proceed before the Public Works Committee at least until it has gone to the national capital committee and proceeded in that fashion. That is why this motion specifically refers to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry I have taken so long. I have dealt with only a small portion of my speech on this topic. The minister did make a quite lengthy statement and it seemed to me that that could not stand without some reply being given to it. It is an important matter and I am grateful for the Senate's support. I hope the government will act upon the decision the Senate has made this morning. </PARA>

After he resumed his seat, Senator Reid rose and sought leave to make a statement, which in effect was a response to the points made by Senator Bolkus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 April 1995 a company called Charrak Air Pty Ltd was given approval to operate Lockheed Electra aircraft, which are chapter 3 noise certified, at Sydney airport during the curfew period. The approval was given by the then Civil Aviation Authority and, on the basis of that approval, the company involved from Victoria made a total investment of approximately $6 million. In fact, the letter from the Civil Aviation Authority to the Director of Charrak Air pointed out very clearly that there were no blanket restrictions on propeller driven aircraft, although I understand the reason for the weight restriction. That was to prevent very noisy aircraft such as Hercules being used for freight. However, this particular aircraft is a chapter 3 aircraft. It made the investment on the basis of the approval given by the authority, which also pointed out, I might say, that with the opening of the Badgerys Creek airport all freighters would be required to go to Badgerys Creek, which it did not object to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I want to ask&mdash;this is apparently an unintended consequence of the bill&mdash;is: does the government believe that it is liable, or could be liable, for damages by Charrak Air for having given approval and then having introduced a bill which we are now debating which will prevent that aircraft from doing the job for which it was purchased?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice is that in fact no approval was given. I am advised that the department advised the company. I am also advised there is no unintentional consequence. It is a quite deliberate consequence, I might say, for the benefit of residents that the BAe146s have in fact been determined because of their particular flight characteristics&mdash;as Senator Parer knows, they are a particularly quiet aircraft&mdash;as being the standard, if you like, for aircraft operating. The intent is not to permit the opportunity for that to be circumvented by larger props which are in fact noisier. I know Senator Parer is fully aware of the particular noise problems of a Lockheed Electra. They are in fact significantly noisier than the BAe146.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice is that the operator was simply told of the then existing restrictions under the then regulations, and was advised of that simply as an information exercise. I am further advised that the operator of the company was specifically advised that, particularly after the establishment of the Morris committee&mdash;that is, the major examination of all of these issues before a parliamentary committee&mdash;the situation then had to be considered, by the operator, to be fluid and could change, consistent with what might happen in respect of any outcomes from that Morris committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice from the officers is that no formal approval was given; that the operator was advised of the existing situation and that that has been interpreted, I think by some wrongly, as an approval. But further, specific advice was given to the operator that that situation could not be considered to necessarily remain after the Morris committee, particularly, had been established; and that there is no unintended consequence. It is deliberately intended that aircraft that are noisier than the 146, those with large props like an Electra, cannot get around these provisions by coming in during these hours, and that is why the limit has been set at 34,000 kilograms. If Senator Parer has specific advice that a formal approval was given, I would like to see it. </PARA>

These restrictions, for the benefit of the people of Sydney&mdash;and that is why I find it a little difficult, I have to say, to equate what you are saying now with the position that the opposition presumes to adopt on looking after the residents of Sydney&mdash;are not unintentional; they are deliberately intended to keep noisy aircraft like Electras out of the airport after curfew hours. </PARA>

<PARA>Last night the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) during his second reading speech invited me to make some comments. Senator Collins talked about political opportunism. If ever there was a bunch of political opportunists, it is the people who sit on the other side of this chamber. Senator Collins will remember that in 1988 he and I, both humble backbenchers, sat on the Senate Standing Committee on Infrastructure. At the time, there was an FAC proposal for a new medium-spaced runway on the basis that all three runways would continue to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new runway would mean that there would be more take-offs and landings from the south; hence the reasoning given in the minority report&mdash;Senator Collins nods&mdash;that there would be less noise to the people on the north, the east and the west. The overwhelming evidence supported the fact that this procedure should take place, but because the government policy of the day had consistently&mdash;from 1983 on&mdash;been that it would not build a new runway, he vowed to sign himself to a majority agreement which said, `Let us go ahead with Badgerys Creek, and maybe down the track we might need to build a new runway.' That was the thrust of the report. </PARA>

When you ask them the question: aren't you required to do what you can to promote government policy? their answer is, `Of course.' I understand that. Basically, the whole thrust of this operation of Sydney airport has been a political decision&mdash;not advice given by the old CAA or the old FAC&mdash;made to the surprise of former Senator Graham Richardson and probably to the surprise of Senator Collins because he never expected the government to turn 180 degrees on building the new runway. </PARA>

Following the government's decision and the early opening of the new parallel runway, the CAA, as it was then, was given three runways, of which 1 were active.

That is nonsense. I did not run air traffic control, nor would I presume to. That is what you are doing. That is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the day very well&mdash;I will not forget it&mdash;when that conflict nearly occurred on that intersection because of simultaneous operations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you what, it gives you a different perspective about these issues, and I freely admit it. I spent 10 years in opposition and during those 10 years I was shadow minister for almost everything. It gives you a whole new perspective when you are actually sitting in the seat and you are a minister. It is a completely different situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a happy situation, as you described it, Senator Parer. Airservices Australia, or the then Civil Aviation Authority, did not happily operate simultaneous operations with potential conflicts on the ground and in the air at Sydney airport. In fact, it cannot be said any better than by them. Senator Parer tries to insist that this amendment does not interfere with how Airservices Australia operates Sydney airport from a safety and capacity point of view. The statement they made this year says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Services Australia today reaffirmed that while parallel runways were available at Sydney airport it would not be prepared to restore simultaneous, independent runway operations using the east-west runway in intersecting operations with parallel north-south runway systems.</PARA>
<PARA>That is their position, which this amendment seeks to direct them to change. The situation is that, yes, you can operate simultaneous operations on intersecting airports&mdash;they do around the world&mdash;but, as the evidence that has been given to your committee and was certainly given to me in the three years I was minister indicates, it requires a greater degree of constant diligence and professionalism, which is always there, by both pilots and air traffic controllers in order to do so, particularly when you are going to operate with frequencies of up to 80 movements an hour, which is going to happen at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this happened, as Senator Parer knows, is that a lot of the airports around Australia and around the world which have this expensive infrastructure have got intersecting runways because they date from the days when aircraft could not do anything else except land directly into the wind. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. They are old airports. They have been continually upgraded and continually strengthened instead of being rebuilt. They are leftovers from the days when the aircraft's performance did not allow anything other than a direct landing into the wind for the safest landing. The high performance aircraft that are available now do not have to operate in such tolerances. That is why most of the new airports established around the world, including Badgerys Creek, have got parallel runways instead of intersecting runways. The aircraft available can now use parallel runways. They do not have to fly in the same tolerances they had to 20 years ago when all these other airports were built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do you then have simultaneous operations? This is the huge hole in the coalition's position, and they know it. They just wash their hands and say, `Oh well, we're not actually telling them how to operate the east-west runway.' Although you will not admit it, Senator Parer, if you operate the east-west runway in the way you are suggesting&mdash;that is, without simultaneous operations&mdash;then you absolutely destroy the capacity at the airport; you slow it down. Simultaneous operations are implemented in order to increase frequencies. Yes, they can operate. </PARA>

In respect of no runways being safer than single runways, I give Senator Burns 10 out of 10 for his observation that that would not be the case if you were trying to actually land on one. It is true and I agree with you, Senator. Parallel runways are safer than intersecting runways if you have got them to use&mdash;we now have them at Sydney, but they were not there in 1991&mdash;and a single runway is safer than having more than one runway, whether it is parallel or intersecting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to lay to rest this nonsense that was put earlier in this debate&mdash;I notice it has not been run lately&mdash;that the second parallel runway does not actually cross the east-west runway and, therefore, you do not have to worry about whatever complications would be caused by now operating simultaneous operations with two parallel runways instead of just one intersecting runway. Of course, that is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aircraft have to cross the east-west runway at a particular point sooner or later to get to the airport terminal. This means that you have got an aircraft crossing that runway about once every 45 seconds, Senator Parer, whether you like it or not. What is unarguable is the fact that parallel runway operations reduce the potential conflict points. Sure, there are potential dangers; of course, there are. If pilots do not turn the way they are supposed to turn, then there will always be problems. But the number of potential conflict points with parallel runways, both in the air and on the ground, is significantly less than the number of potential conflict points on the ground and in the air with intersecting runways. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell you from the horse's mouth, Senator Parer, how happy everybody was with simultaneous operations, from me down, including the Civil Aviation Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. I sat in the seat and got the advice. You can do it, Senator Parer, and you know you can do it. Pilots and air traffic controllers, being the incredible professionals they are, operate in a highly technological and professional occupation that places enormous demands on their skills and so on. That is why they have such early retirement ages and a high frequency of burnouts, particularly the air traffic controllers. It is a very stressful occupation, particularly when something goes wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the other problem with reintroducing the east-west runway and simultaneous operations. Simultaneous operations are difficult enough and it requires&mdash;the evidence has been given before your committee and it was always given to me&mdash;a very high degree of application by both pilots and air traffic controllers when every minute or so aircraft are on a potential collision course both in the air and on the ground. That is how they work. When there is something wrong and pilots have to keep going around and aborting landings, it makes the operation even more difficult and stressful. That is also a fact, Senator Parer, and you know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell you that there was a sigh of relief around the place when those international operations were suspended at Sydney.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there have been proposals over the years about fixing the problems of Sydney airport. It probably is in the wrong place, at least on some arguments that can be advanced, but it is where it is and we cannot wish it away. It is certainly too small to handle the degree of traffic that any international city like Sydney has to cope with. Of course, it is also surrounded by heavily populated areas. So it is not a simple problem to fix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years we have continued to lurch from crisis to crisis or ad hoc decision to ad hoc decision to deal with the problem. What we now have in the amendment moved by Senator Parer&mdash;of course, it is really the proposition advanced by the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard&mdash;is another one of those ad hoc, knee-jerk, hopefully quick fix solutions. It is no solution at all, as the minister has outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, that is a real problem because we are never going to fix the problems of noise, congestion, et cetera at Sydney airport by reacting in the way that this amendment proposes. There is a major problem now of increased noise for a reduced number of residents in Sydney&mdash;and that is a severe problem. We would like to fix it quickly if we could, but we are never going to fix that problem by just simply saying let us reopen the east-west runway and, not only reopen it, let us direct the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to reopen it irrespective of what advice may come to the contrary from various safety experts. In some ways, that is how we got the problem we&mdash;the community and those on all sides of the chamber&mdash;have today; that is, in the past we have looked at just bandaid solutions to Mascot airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was finally this government that took the decision to construct a second airport. It had been long talked about but very little had been done about it. We have got to get away from this sort of ad hoc approach. There are very good reasons why this proposal to reopen the east-west should not be implemented. It is quite clear that it is simply a reaction by a worried member for Bennelong trying to find a quick fix solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can find proof of that by looking back at the campaign to build the third runway.

I used to travel around the country quite a bit, and I do not know how many times I would have sat in aircraft or in airport lounges in Melbourne and other cities and been given messages that my plane was delayed because of congestion at Sydney airport. When I finally got on the plane, the pilot would say that we were going to sit there for another 10 to 15 minutes because of the problems at Sydney airport. We would get this PR line from pilots and everyone else that there are these problems at Sydney airport and the sooner somebody does something about fixing them&mdash;like getting a third runway&mdash;the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, you never mentioned noise. Noise was not mentioned here. The only time noise was mentioned in your minority report was that, as a by-product of building the third runway, solving the problem of congestion and removing the inconvenience to travellers, there would also be a halving of the number of residents affected by noise. But it was not the major consideration at the time. You have now moved from that to all this concern about the residents and the noise impact. And, of course, it is a real impact. But one has to question very seriously the motivations of the opposition in all of this. Because that is now the political issue of the day. That is the concern that is being expressed to you in the community. So what is your solution? Another ad hoc, quick fix solution: reopen the east-west runway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has said, and as all the evidence that has come before us has shown, parallel runway operations are safer. That is as logical as day follows night. Those operations are safer. As I said yesterday, you only have to look at the situation on roads. Whilst it may be safe to drive down an undivided road, there is a risk of a head-on collision. Similarly, when you drive through an intersection there is a risk of a collision. But when you drive along a divided road you remove those risks and thereby make it safer. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are talking about here, Senator Parer, is aircraft on the ground. We are talking about the potential for on-the-ground collisions at Sydney airport through the use of intersecting runways&mdash;the very situation which was within three seconds of occurring at Sydney airport in August 1991. Three aircraft within the vicinity of that intersection&mdash;two were landing and one was parked nearby ready to taxi out&mdash;and over 600 people were three seconds away from a huge disaster. Thank God it did not occur. It did not occur because of the skill of the pilot who got that Ansett plane to abort the landing and clear the Thai aircraft that was on the ground, and the skill of the air traffic controllers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That risk has been removed because we have removed intersecting operations. We have a situation now that is clearly safer. The false argument constantly put throughout this entire debate and the proceedings before the Senate committee by members of the opposition, particularly Senator Woods, has been, `You have said it is less safe.' As representatives of Airservices Australia and other safety organisations&mdash;and indeed government members&mdash;have said all through, we are not saying that it is unsafe to use intersecting runways. But what is clear is that it is safer&mdash;it is more safe&mdash;to use parallel runway operations instead of intersecting runway operations. The fact that intersecting runway operations may be used throughout the world at other airports, or indeed in Australia, is no reason to take a system which is safer, which is more safe today, and go backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never heard it seriously suggested in any area when looking at safety, and if you have a system which maximises safety, that you should reduce safety. Nobody in their right mind would seriously suggest that, where we have the divided sections of the highway between Sydney and Canberra so that we avoid head-on collisions, we should fill in all that area between the two sections of the road and bring back undivided roads and bring back the risk of collisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really the parallel of your proposal. You are suggesting that, instead of having a safer system which avoids the risk of on-ground collisions at intersections and all of the attendant problems that go with it&mdash;as the minister has quite rightly pointed out, the fact that you do not have collisions does not mean that everything is hunky-dory&mdash;you have greater pressure on the air traffic controllers and you have greater risks because of the increased need for go-arounds, aborted landings and all of those other attendant problems. It is just illogical to suggest that we should reduce safety in order to supposedly spread the noise. On the key ground of safety, we have a safer system now. Why go backwards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to congestion. With that safer  system we are now able to maintain the rate of movements and we are able to improve the rate of movements through Sydney airport and therefore reduce congestion with the new parallel runway operations and the introduction of the new radar system. We have improved the situation for the travellers by reducing congestion&mdash;and it will get better&mdash;and we have increased safety. Yet you want to go backwards. You want to go backwards because there are people affected by noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to solve their problem today&mdash;I think we all would&mdash;but this is no way to solve their problem. As we know, you will actually make it worse. Let us look at it. You will increase substantially the number of residents that will be affected by aircraft noise. You will bring it back for all of those areas on the old east-west flight path. Whilst you may reduce the intensity of it to some extent, you will open up opportunities through some of the proposals to put more jets on the north-south runway and increase the level of noise to the north. You know, Senator Parer, and we all know, that we are endeavouring at all times to keep the airlines from increasing those movements through Sydney airport. The best way to do that at the moment is to continue with these operations we have now and not provide opportunities for greater pressure to be brought to bear to increase the number of movements and increase the noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say this: this whole proposal is put up as supposedly reducing the noise for one group of residents and sharing it with the rest of Sydney. Allegations have been made about political bias. As you said yesterday, Senator Parer, it is still Labor electorates that are copping a lot of this noise&mdash;like they copped it for years and years when you were in government and did nothing to solve these problems. It is the Liberal electorates particularly to the north of Sydney that will never cop the noise no matter what proposition you implement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To his credit, Senator Forshaw raised the issue of the noise problem, which is a major problem and has been for quite some time. It is fascinating that not once did the minister refer to the noise disaster in Sydney caused by his government. The government should listen to these people. It has lost touch. This is noise pollution at its worst, brought on by a government and a minister, who did not even refer to it. The minister is running a scare campaign. When talking about capacity, he was at odds with Senator Forshaw. He said that if you go down this route you want to go you are going to reduce capacity, but Senator Forshaw said that you are going to increase capacity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I started making some comments before Senator Parer's three amendments were actually moved, and I would like to conclude them now. One of the comments I also made by way of interjection was that the statement by Senator Parer that the intention of this amendment is to allow for the safest decisions, the best decisions, to be made by the operators is not actually what comes out in the wording of the amendment. It does not say `by allowing increased use if circumstances allow maximum safety', or whatever. It simply says `by increasing the use of the runway known as the east-west runway'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In none of my statements on this matter have I not said that I understand and fully sympathise with the agonies that those people living directly under the flight paths of the Sydney airport operation have undergone. They have been misled, and that is a very important part of the anger involved. The anger, as mentioned before in this chamber, has resulted from the way they have been dealt with as a result of the impact. I am sure that if many of those people had been dealt with more fairly they would be feeling a little better about it. But they do not feel that the government has been dealing with them fairly. The safety angle obviously is important to them. But they just see their lives as intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see that this amendment, which simply says `by increasing the use of the runway known as the east-west runway', is an answer which is any less political than possibly the original decision that was made. Without having had the opportunity of seeing the results of the committee deliberations, I am not in a position to make a decision on the safety or otherwise of this decision. I do not feel that by simply putting in an amendment which says `by increasing the use of the runway known as the east-west runway' we are going to get to a decision where safety is necessarily placed as the highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that had been the intent of the amendment, I am sure it could have been written in a way that signified that intent. But it did not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with Senator Parer that it has all been put on the table and there is no need in uselessly wasting the time of the committee in more prolonged debate, and I do not intend to do so. A number of specific questions were put to me just then, and I will answer and respond to some of the things that were said. Then I will say no more, Senator Parer; I will be brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the question Senator Sandy Macdonald put to me about what political instructions I gave to Kinhills in respect of the EIS, the answer is none. The only instructions at the many briefings that I gave Kinhills were to get it done on time, on budget and accurately. I can assure Senator Macdonald that in terms of me trying to second-guess one of the more competent consulting and engineering firms in Australia&mdash;I do not think Senator Parer would deny that&mdash;I certainly did not and no such instructions were given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister who simply got the job first cab off the rank of oversighting the actual EIS if the decision to go ahead with construction had been taken, there is one little matter that has not been raised in this debate so far, particularly post-Sackville, that I might just intrude. One thing I know about the EIS process is that the entire process&mdash;all $7 million of it, from memory&mdash;was predicated on a reduced use of the east-west runway at Sydney airport. The whole premise on that was that on both safety and operational grounds, parallel runways would be more effective, efficient and safer and would result in a net reduction in the number of people seriously affected by noise at Sydney airport. The entire EIS was predicated on that. It would be a moot point that if this amendment was carried, to the horror I am sure of Senator Parer, before it could even be implemented you would have to implement a new EIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a lawyer, but I am familiar with a few forestry and mining decisions that have been taken recently. In fact, I have been the designator of a number of those post-Sackville. The basis of the Sackville decision was that if things had materially changed since there had been an EIS, even in the forestry area with such things as new technology or new proposals that indicated that the original environmental impact statement had not properly addressed those changes, it would not be sufficient to say that that environmental examination of the issue would suffice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is pure speculation on my part but I simply see the elements here very clearly on a number of the matters that have been raised recently with regard to mining and forestry operations that I am familiar with. I do know intimately that the entire EIS process was done on the basis that there would be a reduced use of the east-west runway and use of parallel runway operations. So it could well be that any such proposal would have to be designated and that it may well be that the environmental authorities, who would have the final decision, may well take the decision that a new EIS would have to be done before such a thing could be implemented. I had not heard it canvassed in debate and I thought I might, for the completeness of this debate, make that point. That is those two issues covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Senator Parer's&mdash;I am not quite sure why he even did it&mdash;allusion to the story I told about the Beechcraft Baron&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess it was because I was minister. You have not been and you may well be and you might reflect on it. As minister I have to routinely be involved in the examination and dissection of accidents. That is why I have such a high regard for the professionalism of people involved. I worked with them for three years and I have great regard for not only their skill but also their application and dedication to the job. They take themselves very seriously, as you know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common thread through most of the serious accidents, as again you know, Senator Parer, is that when major accidents do occur in what is a very safe industry, it is rarely because one or two things go wrong and it is very rarely these days because of any mechanical or technical failure of the aircraft or equipment involved. It is usually because a whole series of things go wrong that normally would not and the combination of all of those events culminates in an accident. That is a common thread that runs through all major accidents around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I reflected on the Baron incident is very simple. I have seen references in accident reports to what precedes an accident. You try to get it out of your head, but you cannot when you are flying at night in a little aircraft. There is nothing wrong with Barons. I was getting to a situation where you are supposed to have left at three in the afternoon, flying in daylight hours, but, because cabinet was delayed, you did not. You thought that day you were going to be travelling in a 12-seater twin turboprop, but, because you did not leave at 3 o'clock, that had to be diverted to another job. When you got there you found that not only were you flying at night but you were flying in a Baron instead of a 12-seater. You sit there composing the accident report and saying, `What happened on this day was . . . ' You know that that was what I was referring to. There were three other individuals there too. I am sure we were perfectly safe, but, particularly coming from the Northern Territory, it was an interesting experience for me&mdash;because it was winter time&mdash;to look out of the window of a tiny little aircraft and see, only 200 feet below the aircraft, it seemed to me, mountain peaks covered in snow. In a lot of the Northern Territory, you have the advantage of being able to find a flat spot if you do need to put down. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct, that is the no runway option. That is the reason I referred to it, Senator Parer. I was not joking, and Senator Parer knows it, when I looked at this amendment and thought about what the royal commission would say about it afterwards. I watched with great interest the royal commission that was held into the Mount Erebus disaster. Senator Macdonald, if you have not seen it, I commend to you the television special that was done on the royal commission. It was a very accurate portrayal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One big thing about royal commissions is that, no matter what they are investigating, they have the wonderful advantage, with hindsight, of 20-20 vision. Everything after the event looks as though it should have been done another way, and things that were absolutely commonplace at the time they were done can be made to look very sinister afterwards. That is why I say&mdash;and I say it again&mdash;that this is a very brave amendment when the head of BASI is saying, as the chief investigator of air traffic accidents in Australia, that it is better to operate parallel runways. Yes, of course you can operate intersecting runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not criticising the pilots; I was in fact doing the reverse. Both pilots and air traffic controllers are consummate professionals and they do not like to admit&mdash;and I know this&mdash;that they cannot do something. If you put to them a theoretical operation, they will say to you, `Yes, we can do that.' It is a `can do' type of profession, I am pleased to say. They have a predisposition to being able to say, `Yes, we are capable of solving just about any theoretical problem you want to put to us. We can handle it. We can make our own separations and we can do this and we can do something else.' But the bottom line still is that the consistent advice I have had, over five or six years now, from everybody connected with the operation of Sydney airport is that it is better to operate a parallel runway system, which provides fewer conflict points on both the ground and in the air, than a system of intersecting runways, even though that system can be operated safely. </PARA>

<PARA>As I said before, I am not moving the second part of my amendments because I believe they relate to what ought to be part of a holistic operational approach. I will look at them in my response and, I hope, in the committee's response to the airport noise committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of my amendments&mdash;Nos 1 to 12&mdash;relates to this bill and to the curfew. The object of these amendments is to increase the time of the curfew by an hour. At the moment, the curfew period exists between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. My amendments would extend that curfew by an hour so that it would exist between 10.30 at night and 6.30 in the morning. The reason for this is that we believe the seven-hour curfew is particularly inadequate to meet the sleeping patterns of children, of the sick, of the elderly and of shift workers. An extended curfew is something that would be very useful. One of the things that has come out of the airport noise committee is that probably the two most obvious ways people believe that their lives could be improved would be with more sleeping time&mdash;sleep is so important to us&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing these amendments. I am grateful to Senator Bourne for moving them together. I will reply to them together so that we do not delay the debate unnecessarily. It is true that the night-time hours are the really important ones. That is why I pointed out by way of interjection a few moments ago that the proposition that you can somehow operate the east-west runway during the day when the traffic does ease off and that that would have some dramatic effect on noise is a fallacy. It is true that the curfew tolls the knell of parting day. It is those night-time hours that are the crucial ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take this opportunity to point out what everybody knows: a great many of us want to use airports and fly. As I said before, Australia has got a small population and is highly urbanised in cities that are separated by enormous distances. Due to the technology available in Europe, Japan and other more highly populated centres, they have very high speed trains. The traffic and the relatively short distances can make such a service pay, or not lose very much. I regret to say&mdash;because I would be a regular user of them&mdash;that such services are not available as easily in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to seeing the day when there is such a service between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, which is what the proposition is. It is not the buses that that affects, because of the cost of the tickets. The competition for such a service is flying. It is the airways that would, in that sense, be the losers once such a service is established. But those options are not readily available yet in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that everybody wants the convenience, speed and safety of air travel but nobody wants the airport in their backyard. One of the things that have irritated me about this debate in terms of the backflips that have been done on it&mdash;I am not directing this at the opposition; I am talking about all the groups that are protesting, understandably, about the third runway&mdash;is that the public debate has gone a long way beyond the third runway at Sydney airport. It seems to me to be polarised very strongly in no airport at all. People are protesting strongly, and they are entitled to do so from their perspective. The foundation on which this debate is now based is that people want to see Sydney airport closed down completely and moved out to Badgerys Creek where it will operate for 24 hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on any further about this, but I want it to be noted that the inevitable has already happened; that is, that very active movement has begun&mdash;it started some time ago&mdash;of the residents of Badgerys Creek protesting about the noise at Badgerys Creek. I am sure Senator Bourne is well aware of that. As someone who is interested in these major public policy debates, I have noted that meetings are being held regularly in the Badgerys Creek area and are routinely attracting hundreds of people in Badgerys Creek who do not want the aircraft at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time everyone thought it would be terrific to have an airport out there as it would bring industry to the area. No doubt there will still be a strong debate. All this does is indicate just how typical this debate is around the world. People are starting to think that somehow this is unique to Australia, that somehow these problems at Sydney airport are unique to Sydney airport. As everybody knows, they are not. This is a major debate around the world, particularly with major international airports in capital cities. You have only to go to Japan to see how intense the debate can become. People have actually lost their lives over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem with those competing uses, as Senator Parer correctly pointed out, that constantly have to be faced of noise, capacity, safety and, of course, the commercial advantages that operations such as this bring to a community. I am advised that the last meeting that was held at Badgerys Creek by residents to protest at any aircraft going into Badgerys Creek was held only last week and attracted an audience of close to 500 people. I simply wanted that to be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address all the objections to these amendments. The reason we are opposing the amendments is that all operations that are currently planned between 2200 and 2235 would have to be moved to prior to 2200 to ensure arrival or departure by 2230. This would impact seriously on the freight industry&mdash;that is, those freight aircraft that operate late in the evening but include curfew hours. It would also exacerbate problems of moving current international flights back from the 2300 to 2400 shoulder. As far as the 0630 start of the curfew is concerned, this would have a major impact on international flights to Australia during the northern summer season which runs from March to October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's objective is to progressively reduce the number of flights arriving in the 0500 to 0600 shoulder period. The effect is that often the existing gate and terminal capacity at Sydney airport becomes fully utilised for about three hours. Extending the curfew to 0630 would exacerbate the situation. Flights may transfer to other Australian airports, but it is more likely that they will be cancelled as Sydney is the preferred destination for many tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the one option that is available is that, if people do not want the airport at Sydney and if people now do not want the airport at Badgerys Creek, you could possibly move the entire operation to Melbourne and then have people travel by train from Melbourne to Sydney if they want to visit Sydney. As someone suggested, the international airport could be moved to Canberra and we could have people moving from Canberra. All of these things are being proposed. I do not think they are achievable solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the possibility that one reaction to this change in curfew hours would mean the cancellation of flights rather than having them diverted. It is also the government's wish to phase out the curfew shoulder periods. But the government would prefer to do so as additional gate and terminal capacity becomes available, either at Sydney or with the completion of Sydney West at Badgerys Creek, so as to minimise all of the impacts that I have mentioned above on both freight services, which this proposal would impact on quite seriously, and international travel to and from Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not support these amendments. Basically the reason we will not is that all this was canvassed by the Morris committee when the original bill went off to it. To a large degree, Senator Collins has reflected the views expressed in the position taken when there were changes to the original John Howard bill, which we support. Those changes were reflected in the bill itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Bourne made the remark that there were two aspects to the noise problem. One was night time, when noise is exacerbated&mdash;we all know that&mdash;and there is not the background noise that dulls the noise of aircraft. The other one is frequency. From the evidence we certainly received, I think frequency is the one that has caused major problems. This would not affect frequency, depending on the time of the day, but the peak periods could be stretched out, depending on when international flights and so on came in. But I am not sure it would do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is the one that Senator Collins referred to. Certainly a vast number of people genuinely believe that they were deceived over the whole Sydney airport thing, but this has now flown on to Badgerys Creek. Senator Collins is quite right. People are concerned that what happened at Sydney airport will happen to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also mentioned quite correctly that to some degree it is not just an Australian problem, it is a worldwide problem. Even though I am going down the Senator Collins path, I am not going to talk about Barons. I noted with interest the other day that the second runway at Narita airport in Japan is now being built after 20 years of dispute. But it is real and the concerns of those people must be taken on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that these amendments proposed would achieve anything, from the point of view of the people who are affected. I am not even sure whether it would politically, from Senator Bourne's point of view, because if you go there then maybe it is not enough&mdash;maybe it should be two hours or three hours and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some of the comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), especially in relation to a possible alternative to noise which might occur as a result of Badgerys Creek. It will be very important for the government&mdash;whichever government is involved with Badgerys Creek&mdash;to make very clear to the people of Badgerys Creek exactly what kind of aircraft will be used in that location, what kinds of flights there will be and, if there is to be a major airport at Badgerys Creek, to clarify what kinds of development issues might arise if there are in fact conflicts of interest in some sort of land use that the government is involved with in that area in relation to the development of an airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One that springs to mind is the development of the St Marys site. Australian Defence Industries are wishing to sell that to a very large number of people as a housing development&mdash;for very considerable prices, I imagine, in order to develop it as a desirable suburb. If the government is, on the one hand, wishing to make money from an ex-military site by creating a very extensive and perhaps somewhat exclusive housing suburb&mdash;which is going to be right under the flight path of what may well be, from what we hear from the minister, the major Sydney airport&mdash;then people would be entitled to know whether there might not be a conflict of interest in what the government is doing. So, with the credibility gap that has arisen as a result of what has happened at Sydney airport, the people at Badgerys Creek may well be wondering whether or not these positions have been clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possible outcome of these amendments might signal to the airlines that there might need to be some rationalisation of services, which might mean some air travellers will have to put up with fewer services but which are rationalised through Sydney airport. If that is a signal to airlines that they could be part of the solution, then I am inclined to support the amendment. I am aware of the numbers, but I think it is a good signal that we must all be part of the solution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sale of the ANL has been a tortuous process for this government. It has highlighted once again the ineptitude of a government in dealing with any matters of a serious financial consequence. It has also highlighted once again the obvious fact that this government is now more than ever quite willing to adopt the policies and the programs which have been advocated by the coalition for many years. This is a catch-up government&mdash;a government which is trying to catch up on the ideas and philosophies of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of ANL was first announced in the 1991 budget following a study by Price Waterhouse-Potter Warburg to investigate the disposal of 49 per cent of ANL. Not surprisingly, their report concluded that a 49 per cent share in ANL would be unattractive to buyers and, accordingly, they recommended a complete divestiture of the Commonwealth's holdings in ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators would be aware that ANL has reappeared in every Labor budget since that announcement yet, as we all know, it still remains unsold. One of my colleagues in the other place, Mrs Bishop, the shadow minister for privatisation and Commonwealth-state relations, described the ANL Sale Bill 1995 as the `ANL liquidation bill' and, in that regard, Mrs Bishop is certainly correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains provisions relating to the transition and saving arrangements for employee entitlements prior to the sale. It also includes provisions relating to the transfer of ANL assets, liabilities and the rights of the Commonwealth. It attempts to cover the possibility of performance results worse than forecast and expenses incurred transferring items out of ANL. Under the bill, no levy will be imposed on ANL's borrowings after the sale day and further capital injections from the Commonwealth to ANL will stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee&mdash;of which my colleague Senator Gibson played a very significant role&mdash;for examination. Although at the end of the day the coalition is prepared to support the passage of the bill, it nevertheless should be noted that there are a number of concerns which we feel have not been adequately addressed. In particular, I refer to clause 67 of the ANL Sale Bill 1995, which appears to provide the Minister for Finance with a very wide discretion in relation to the payment of up to $15 million for costs associated with the sale of the Australian National Line. The matter is further complicated by the absence of any specific guidelines in the bill to govern such payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the committee hearings, the departmental officers were unable to allay any concerns and instead referred my colleagues to a letter which was provided to Mrs Bishop on a commercial-in-confidence basis. It is on that basis that we in the coalition will be supporting the bill today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said initially, one of the key failings to emerge in the government's handling of the sale of the ANL was the performance of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who must surely be, like Carmen Lawrence, a millstone around the neck of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as he heads to the next election. These matters have also drawn the attention of the Auditor-General. The performance audit of the Australian National Audit Office entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Matters relating to the proposed sale of ANL Ltd</EMPHASIS> was presented to the parliament on 22 August 1995. That report was extremely critical of the high level of attrition that existed between the various parties involved in the sale. It noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore difficult not to conclude that there would have been a better chance of achieving the Government's objectives if there had been a better meeting of minds to overcome any identified obstacles or difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>It further noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A degree of uncertainty surrounding the objectives of the sale and the means of achieving these objectives would have aggravated any sale process.</PARA>
<PARA>So we see that the concerns regarding the government's handling of this matter are concerns not only of the coalition but also of the Auditor-General, as they are plainly reflected in the Auditor-General's conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same report also raises some additional concerns, including the fact that the losses of ANL from 1991 to June 1994 were $53.7 million. This loss does not include a provision of $78.87 million for restructuring in the accounts to 30 June 1994. These figures should leave no-one in doubt that the financial position of ANL has had the potential to be a considerable financial burden upon the Australian taxpayer. We all remember the statement by Minister Brereton on 22 August 1994 that `you couldn't give ANL away'. This was a most peculiar statement from a minister responsible for devolving an asset on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to go back to 1 March 1994 to further examine the efforts of Minister Brereton in undermining the whole process of privatisation. On that day, Minister Brereton put the interests of his union and Labor mates ahead of the interests of both the Australian National Line and the country by sacking the entire nine-member ANL board. This was a lawfully constituted board and Minister Brereton deprived it of funds for carrying out its commercial operations without his approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton took control of the Australian National Line by stacking the ANL board with some of his old mates. I am sure the names Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull are familiar to all of us in this chamber. They, along with another director, were appointed by Minister Brereton to do the jobs that the previous board refused to do. The previous board wished to undertake a detailed study before signing off on their obligations under the Corporations Law. This new threesome were obviously much more inclined to go along with the whims of Minister Brereton, and the Australian taxpayers paid them in excess of $816,000 for their services. Not only was this a disgraceful rorting of due process; it has also proved to be a disgraceful rorting of taxpayers' funds to assist old Labor mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date of 1 March was also when Minister Brereton ensured that the Task Force on Asset Sales operating through the Minister for Finance was to be the first point of reference for all inquiries relating to the sale. The minister changed the articles of association of ANL Ltd to make sure that the directors could not take any action or enter into any transaction that could be perceived as prejudicing the Commonwealth sale options. In doing this, Minister Brereton effectively squeezed the old board out of the process because they would not play ball, but the reality is that neither ANL management nor ANL workers have ever been given a fair go by Minister Brereton. They have never been given a fair go because they did not fit in with the minister's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace that the ANL board had to find out about the future through the newspapers. The evidence given to the committee by the former chairman of ANL, Mr Bill Bolitho, a man well respected in maritime circles, is evidence enough that the ministers and his predecessors have simply been fooling around with ANL. Since Mr Bolitho and the former head of the Seamen's Union, Pat Geraghty, were sacked by Minister Brereton, the Australian taxpayers have paid a high price. In fact, taxpayers have lost $146 million as a direct result of Minister Brereton's meddling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that $146 million, the minister has also sought to placate the maritime unions with a $20 million handout to shipowners. This has been a very expensive blunder on behalf of the government. I wonder, as I am sure many around here wonder, what special skills Mr Wran, Mr Turnbull and their fellow board member have in the shipping industry. Senators would probably be very interested to know that Mr Neville Wran, the old mate, collected $301,000 for a mere two days work a week over a period of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In providing evidence to the Senate inquiry, Mr Bolitho indicated that the minister informed the Maritime Union of Australia that he was out to get the board of ANL. I am sure my colleague Senator Gibson will illuminate on this particular part of the minister's action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those ill-judged comments by the minister were based on a valuation of ANL carried out by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers. The minister would not discuss this valuation with the board, nor would he discuss it with anyone else. He simply acted on his own judgment, which has since been proved, like a lot of other things he has done, to be deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this minister was really serious about the future of ANL, why did he sack the board and why did he replace it with part-time directors whose background demonstrated Labor Party affiliations but no experience whatsoever in operating a shipping company? Further, what value have the taxpayers got from the $816,000 they have paid to Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other gentleman to resolve the problem? It is now over 12 months since we were told that Mr Wran and his cohorts would fix the problem. The only evidence we have seen of their efforts to date is that they have accumulated an additional $24 million worth of operating losses for ANL and it succeeded in deteriorating its value substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the minister has been trying to save his face within the Labor Party, the sorry saga of his handling of ANL and its sale will haunt the government right up to the next election. The former chairman of ANL, when providing evidence before the Senate inquiry, indicated that one of the major assets of ANL, Australian Stevedores, was sold to Jamieson Equities for $10 million&mdash;and that is $11 million less than its true value. How could a minister let these sorts of things happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton has proven that he is totally unable to handle this type of asset sale. He has concentrated solely on keeping his union mates happy and in a job and on passing over taxpayers' money to his union mates. As a result, all that Australian taxpayers have inherited is a lemon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is not the only failure we have seen from Minister Brereton. We have just completed here, this morning, the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill. We all know of the mess he has made of the Sydney airport. That is just another one of his abject failures. His industrial relations record is another absolute mess. We are seeing evidence of that in Queensland. We have a national strike coming up about which he has been critical. I notice that he has come out of the woodwork and had a few words to say today about the Comalco effort and the national strike. But, really and truly, he sat back and let all this happen&mdash;without any intervention, without trying to fix it in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Minister Brereton must be at least at the top of the hit list to be sacked. If he is not, then I do not know who it would be&mdash;perhaps Carmen Lawrence, or someone else. Mr Brereton must be sacked from his present ministerial position if the government is to retain any credibility at all. For the government to do anything else but sack him after his inept handling of this particular sale would be further evidence of its inability to soundly manage this country's finances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Calvert on the ANL Sale Bill 1995. There is a saying: the fool does think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. If this government honestly believed that it was wise to sell the Australian national shipping line in the manner in which it has, then we are left to conclude that this government is truly foolish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many nautical analogies which one could make in respect of the ANL Sale Bill 1995. However, I believe that it is most appropriate to commence by stating what many would consider to be the obvious. Without any hesitation or doubt, this bill marks most definitively the high-water mark of public administration incompetence by the Keating Labor government. How else can you characterise the sale of a public asset in which it is more likely than not that, at the end of the process, at the end of four years, at the end of an acrimonious and tortured demonstration of bureaucratic stumbling and ineptitude, the seller may well be forced to pay the buyer to take the asset away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How the true believers must be turning in their graves this day, knowing that a Labor government would actually pay the private sector to take away Australia's national shipping line. It would have been high treason in the Labor Party to have even proposed this sale just 10 years ago. But then Paul Keating was not Prime Minister 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is uncontestable that the ANL has not been in a strong financial position for very many years. Indeed, for the entire life of the governments of Labor Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating, ANL has been hung out to dry in any true commercial sense, starved of the one element that could have kept the line afloat&mdash;capital. For most of the last 15 years, the ANL ships have been inefficient, outdated and inappropriate. Such facts, however, have not recently come to light; they were well known more than 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why then would a Labor government not find it within its heart and soul to provide the capital that was needed&mdash;not last year, not three years ago, but at least 10 years prior to now. The answer is a sad reflection on this government and its capacity to either manage the economy or to be honest with the citizens of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL never received the funds it was seeking because of the mess Labor made of successive federal budgets. Because promises had been made to interest groups to keep Labor in power, there was no money available to pay for the vital capital requirements of the shipping line. Should this be a surprise to anyone? Not at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine former Senator Graham Richardson, as the face of the ALP, rationalising this seeming incongruity with bland indignity. ANL, and in particular the workers of ANL, would be considered hard core Labor supporters. They would never vote for the coalition, so why bother providing their company with funds to keep it afloat and in government hands?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides, if the ANL collapsed, the MUA and its members would be the only ones to really suffer and they were hardly the government's favourite trade union. So, as neither the Hawke nor Keating governments were in a position to give ANL its lifeline, the government simply decided, probably as long ago as 1989 or 1990, to abandon the ANL, its employees, its heritage and its symbolism for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Hawke government first and, for the past four years, the Keating government have tried to hide the shame of ANL. I say `shame' advisedly because without doubt the government should be ashamed of how it has handled this sale. Most particularly, it should be ashamed that it was never prepared to tell the Australian people the truth about ANL. It should be ashamed that it was prepared to allow the sale process to be ill-conceived, undefined, badly managed and ultimately to have degenerated into farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be ashamed that it was prepared to sacrifice the commercial reputations of the distinguished and committed Australians on the former board of ANL under the stewardship of Mr Bill Bolitho. It should be ashamed that it was prepared to play internecine factional politics within the ALP at the expense of taxpayers' money. There is much for the government to be ashamed about in the sale of ANL, but I doubt we will hear any remorse from those on the government benches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just so those opposite do not seek to brand me a hypocrite, let me be quite clear&mdash;the opposition has long believed that ANL should not have been in government hands. The opposition believes that there has not been for some time now a reason, a justification, for the government running a shipping line. Even given the arguments about the Australian island nation and national pride, the government of Australia has no place operating a commercial shipping venture. The coalition has consistently argued that ANL was a government business that Australia could not afford. The coalition has been consistent on this issue and even now believes that the line should be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How then does our position differ from that of the government? It is clear now that the government always intended to rid itself of ANL. Nevertheless, it could not bring itself to tell the Australian people the truth. It could not bring itself to level with the Australian taxpayer. Instead it hid its true intentions even from the board of the company until it was too late for any possible outcome other than the one we are now witnessing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition agrees that ANL should be sold, it does not accept that the process that the Labor government has undertaken to sell the company reflects well upon Australia. The coalition does not believe that this particular sale has been well managed or executed. Even now we must rely on commitments given privately to our shadow minister by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) as to the manner in which the $15 million allocated in this bill will be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot tell the Australian people what those commitments are or what they mean as the government has refused to tell a parliamentary committee how it intends to spend the money. The Australian people will just have to rely on the word of a Western Australian Labor politician that everything is going to be okay with their money. They must accept what the minister believes to be necessary and desirable for spending $15 million and that it will be in their interests. Some less charitable than I may say they have heard such promises before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of these concerns, the coalition does not believe it has any option but to allow this bill to pass. It is now a necessary element of the sale process established by this government and, regardless of its theoretical unsoundness, the coalition accepts that the end in this instance may justify the means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the coalition will not oppose the bill, what, you may ask, is the difference between the coalition's position on the ANL sale and that of the government? The difference is clear. The coalition would never have allowed the ANL sale process to have become such a farce. The coalition would not have sought to deceive the ANL's directors, its management and the Australian people about its intentions. The coalition would have listened to the advice of the ANL board and would have facilitated the sale of ANL when there was a real chance for a positive and productive sale in November 1992. I repeat: that was back in November of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the ANL was always a bit player in the world maritime industry. It was competing as a small, respected player in a fiercely competitive and distorted market without the equipment and resources to achieve a proper return on invested funds. It is equally clear that the Keating Labor government, which was intent on buying electoral favours and feathering the nest of its allies and supporters, was never going to provide the ANL with the assistance it desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of these obvious facts, there are many questions as yet unanswered. Why did the Keating government allow the failed sale process to drag on for more than four years? Why did it waste over $110 million&mdash;costs of consultants, delays in the process and losses by the company over that period of time&mdash;when there was a real prospect of selling the company four years ago? Why did it devastate the morale of the staff&mdash;of all employees&mdash;of ANL?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did it sack the hamstrung former board of ANL and then let the new board take full control of the sale process without the interference of bureaucrats? Why did it immediately grant to the new board a financial guarantee that the previous board had sought for the previous three years? Why, after four long years, did it eventually leave the fate of the whole sale process in the hands of the militant Maritime Union of Australia, which had long ago proclaimed its conviction that the ANL would never be sold to the only bidder, the P&amp;O group? Moreover, why was the sale process placed in the hands of well-meaning but uninformed officers of the Department of Finance with little or no experience in the maritime industry, its complications, priorities and intricacies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was it necessary to spend thousands of dollars purchasing professional advice from external consultants when that advice existed already within the board and management of ANL? Why was the task force on asset sales, belonging to the Department of Finance, ultimately removed from the sale process? Finally, why did the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) act so quickly to remove the former ANL board when a preliminary report, which was not a full due diligence report on the company, had recommended that further work was needed before any action could be taken on the sale? These are questions that only the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his closest ministerial advisers can answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, through its Finance and Public Administration Committee, has conducted an inquiry into this matter, and its conclusions should make for interesting analysis. In the meantime, should we see a conspiracy in all this? Should we see a cunning and devious scheme by the ALP Right to destroy the left-wing MUA, its leaders and members? Perhaps, with just a touch of the cynic, we could paint such a canvas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I prefer to think that this government is not that clever, even by half. Instead, I see in this unfortunate mess the clammy hands of incompetence and indifference. I believe that many will be seen to have lost something as a result of this failed and ignominious saga. ANL employees will ultimately, no doubt, lose their jobs, their incomes and their dignity. The former board members of ANL have already lost the gleam of their hard-earned reputations. Taxpayers have lost, and will most probably continue to lose, their money. The Department of Finance and the Department of Transport will lose much credibility and integrity in the eyes of many who have, and will in the future, study this sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, however, the saddest loss of all from the sale of ANL will be the loss of faith in government and its processes. That faith, which has already been so cruelly distorted by the Labor government, is at the very core of our democracy. As other nations have found to their horror, once that faith has gone the democratic foundation of our government can never be the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is one day shown that the ANL sale really was more than an exercise in dreadful incompetence and was, in fact, a sham, a fraud or a case study in the ruthless pursuit of political expediency, our democracy will be the loser. I do not seek this day to ascribe blame to particular groups or individuals. I believe that there will be much acrimony before this epic sale is finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is unfair to isolate the sale process of ANL from its entire history. Perhaps we should reflect upon how political and economic power have always been closely intertwined with the ANL, the waterfront and the maritime industry. Nevertheless, I do sincerely believe that the sale process of ANL has been more than just difficult. It has been more than just different. It has been, if I may paraphrase Shakespeare, a story about which there has never been more woe. This bill facilitates the sale of ANL to P&amp;O. I hope that as politicians, as holders of the peoples' trust and mandate and, indeed, as all Australians, we will never again see a sale process like that of the ANL. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been reminded that the ANL Sale Bill 1995 will eventually end up as an act of parliament to facilitate the sale of the Australian National Line to a private company. We are discussing whether such a bill should pass this parliament. It is a sad day that we see yet another of the jewels in the crown&mdash;another one of the assets of Australia&mdash;being sold. In this case there is a great deal of debate about whether cash money will actually find its way to the government or whether it will simply be a removal of obligations and a removal of debt which will no longer accrue. There have been various estimates as to how much money it costs the government each month to continue to operate this particular enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from the coalition, who spent some considerable time illustrating the problems with the process of the sale. We have had some discussion about the need for the sale. What has fascinated those who have commented on this particular saga has been the process. In fact, I chaired the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee which has inquired into the process and is about to present a report on that investigation. The Senate has also been presented with a report from the Australian National Audit Office on matters related to the proposed sale of the Australian National Line Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Calvert pointed out in his contribution, we have also seen a new board appointed by the government which was paid a considerable amount of money&mdash;I will not go into that&mdash;to facilitate the sale process, a process which the previous board did not endorse. That is not surprising because that previous board had been the operating board&mdash;the body charged with the responsibility of operating the enterprise and conducting the business of a shipping line. That is what they have done. We should not be surprised that that operating board was not keen to progress the sale. The new board was appointed to facilitate the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than make comments about the efficacy of that or enter into the discussion about that particular process, I would like to observe that the irony of this debate so far is to hear the coalition reminding the true believers that this ALP government is prepared to pay private enterprise to take over the Australian National Line. The irony continued while Senator Gibson reminded us that the Australian National Line has been denied sufficient capital to maintain a viable business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a government which has been trying to copy the market-driven, profit-seeking, money-chasing philosophy of the economic rationalists, a government eager to play the game of big business, trying to out-commercialise, out-corporatise and out-privatise the private sector. We have in this place a fairly good illustration of that same group falling flat on their face while trying to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what happens so often in the private sector. I do not want to catalogue the failures of entrepreneurs. I merely have to mention that entrepreneurs fail to remind people of that catalogue. There is nothing to be gained by listing the corporate failures in Australia's history, but this is what happens: when you try to play the big game, collapses occur and situations are reached where enterprises no longer continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are talking about a government undertaking in relation to the national line of this island continent, the national shipping line. We are told that the reasons for the sale include that it was not the government's business to conduct such a shipping line, that the ANL was only a bit player on the international scene and that the ANL was not operating well as a commercial enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that it is the government's business, on this island continent, to ensure that there is an alternative to being held to ransom in a strategic sense by other enterprises and overseas interests. It is in Australia's interests and the government's interests to ensure that we are not wholly committed to those who have their interests elsewhere. As an island continent, it is of strategic benefit to ensure that we have some maritime capacity. To criticise ANL for being only a bit player has nothing to do with the reasons why we may or may not have a shipping line. After all, small, active, well managed enterprises are always capable of providing something which large and clumsier organisations are not able to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the ANL was not operating well is not contested, but the question of whose fault it is is a matter of discussion. We were reminded by Senator Gibson of the constraints of capital that were placed upon the operation of this organisation. The enterprise itself may well have been sound; it is the way it was asked to conduct itself which was not sound. They were the criticisms that were offered as being a reason for needing to sell this government undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the question of what it is that is being sold. Essentially, we could look at ANL as consisting of ocean-going vessels, the company infrastructure, onshore facilities, staff, obligations, and other advantages that may have accrued to the name. The question of whether the corporate infrastructure had a value or an economic disadvantage is a question which has never really been answered, because it has been very hard to determine exactly what it is. The ships undoubtedly have some sort of value, but it is hard to determine whether the state of repair, the suitability or the design of the ships is an advantage or a disadvantage economically. Some of the onshore facilities, as has been mentioned, have been sold off, and some of the staff have gone. That changes the nature of what is finally being offered for sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make is that, while the Finance and Public Administration Committee was conducting its inquiry, Mr Neville Wran, in public evidence, offered us a truism: anything is worth only what the market will pay for it; that will be determined by the market, and that is its value. However, it is very important to consider that, if we take anything which is offered in the commercial market, how it is offered is almost as important as what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have struggled to find out what it is that is being offered for sale. The `how' has been very hard to chase. The factors of whether it is offered over a period of time, whether it is offered as a result of what is euphemistically described as a fire sale, whether it is offered as a going concern with some support, whether it is offered encumbered with debt or whether it is offered in a short period of time or a long period of time greatly influence the price that is eventually obtained, as any house seller would be aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at this particular bill, which is needed to facilitate the proposed sale, it is very important that we do not bring to this debate a superficial understanding of what it is that is being sold. Nor should we allow ourselves to be seduced by any superficial description of what it is that is being sold&mdash;superficial descriptions as we have already had from the minister responsible, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). I do not think anybody could justify his comment about what is being sold as being a responsible and helpful one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those differences in mind, I remind the Senate that we are talking here about the actual sale rather than the process. I will excuse myself and add to the discussion of the process because the process has in some ways influenced the argument about whether it is worth selling or retaining it. Page 18 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 2</EMPHASIS> of 1995-96 by the Australian National Audit Office, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Matters relating to the proposed sale of ANL Ltd</EMPHASIS>, states that there are a number of factors that have impacted on proposals for the sale of ANL. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.TFAS documents refer to the lack of cooperation from the previous ANL Board and on some occasions from ANL management;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the delays in ANL's providing its business plan to the consultants undertaking in the 1992 scoping study;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.ANL stated that it wanted the sale to be deferred for a number of years to allow a return to profitability;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the delay in changing ANL's Articles of Association earlier to ensure cooperation in the sale process;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need to resolve maritime policy issues, including consultations with the unions regarding the sale;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the uncertainty of a sale outcome as reflected by the wide variation in values attributed to ANL by Price Waterhouse Potter Warburg in the first scoping study;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need to complete a review of Part X of the Trade Practices Act which would determine the future regulatory environment for ANL;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need to amend the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Platform to allow a sale beyond 49%; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the 1993 Election and a number of Ministerial changes, particularly the Transport Portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that list illustrates that when we are contemplating the sale of a government business enterprise, there is more to it than just hanging out the `for sale' shingle and sitting back, waiting to see what happens. That is the implication given in public evidence by Mr Neville Wran that the market would determine the price. These other factors come into it. These other factors which encumber a government business enterprise come into the price somebody is prepared to pay for that, and the other processes that need to be gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a simple matter and it is not a matter which should be treated in a simplistic way. It concerns me greatly that we have these truisms brought to the argument. They sound plausible in other commercial senses, but we have to come back to the question of what it is that is being sold, and the question of how to sell that is determined by what is being sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that this is an enterprise which has been built up over the years&mdash;paid for by taxpayers and supported by taxpayers, for taxpayers' benefit. In some instances, there is a valid criticism of some of the things ANL was asked to do: to support unprofitable shipping routes and to actually purchase ships which had been built in Australia for strategic reasons. By the way, I support that but it did nothing to improve the commercial returns of the shipping line. It provided other returns to the nation. </PARA>

Mr Court can't remember; he can't remember an event that occurred only a few months ago. He won't come clean and say whether he concocted this royal commission in collusion with Mr Howard. One of the things we do know is that royal commissions usually look into matters of criminal behaviour, financial impropriety, misuse of public funds for public office for private gain, national security, maladministration or failure of public administration, or specific public policy issues. They do not normally look, and never have looked, at matters of cabinet deliberation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know&mdash;and this is relevant, Senator Hill&mdash;that the terms of reference of this royal commission were extremely restrictive.

Mr Court had raised these issues in the state parliament years before the tabling of the petition. There was no inspection of that whatsoever. Those matters, of course, were not for consideration.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Denman for her question. Overwhelmingly the organisations that genuinely represent small business in this country have strongly supported the draft legislation that has been put out as an exposure draft over the last three weeks. The closing date for their responses, or for a response from any member of the public, is 22 November. In that category I would put such organisations as the Motor Trades Association of Australia, which represents over 50,000 small businesses, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Australian Small Business Association and COSBOA&mdash;the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last night at COSBOA's annual dinner I am told that people present indicated their strong support for these amendments. COSBOA is made up of organisations which are all representative of genuine small business. It is a long list, but I think the Senate should be aware of it: the Civil Contractors Federation; the Food Retailers Association of New South Wales; the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association; the Small Business People (Hunter Valley); the Motor Inn, Motel and Accommodation Association; the Small Business Combined Association; the Australian Gifts and Homewares Association; the Furnishers Society of Australia; the Food Retailers Association; the National Australian Retail Grocers Association; and the West Australian Retailers Association. They are all represented in COSBOA and all strongly support the government's amendments to the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some organisations have either not expressed support or have opposed the amendments. One of them is the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and another is VECCI, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has members representing both big and small business. They are in the position of working out who they ought to represent in this case. They should look after the interests of the overwhelming majority of members, which is small business, or some of the very few big businesses that they represent. Not surprisingly, the Bankers' Association and the Law Council of Australia are opposing such changes. Again, all those organisations have affiliations with large and big business in Australia, so this result is not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But every genuine small business organisation in Australia has put their hand up for these amendments to the Trade Practices Act. What is very surprising is the actions of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow spokesperson for small business, Mrs Moylan. Even though they have been going around and saying that at the next election the No. 1 issue for the coalition will be helping small business, they have not declared their view on this legislation. Even though an exposure draft with the actual details of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act is now available for public comment, they still will not make up their minds about what they want to do in supporting or opposing this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only yesterday, when Judi Moylan could not give any indication to the Australian Small Business Association about her view on this, Mr Peter Siekman, the president of that  association, said that the opposition should not take them for granted.

<PARA>So far, the opposition cannot declare their policy on whether they support these amendments to the Trade Practices Act. Every genuine small business organisation in this country says that it wants to have them voted through before the end of this parliamentary session. Within the next three weeks, the opposition will have the opportunity to decide whether they will support them. They will have to make up their mind in this chamber. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Colston for his question because much has been said, particularly by the opposition, in recent times about income inequality in Australia. Many of those opposition claims are very wild and are not factual. This is from an opposition whose only policies so far seem to be labour market deregulation and public spending cuts, both of which would increase inequality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turns out that these claims are very much at odds with the attitudes of the Australian people. I quote the results of the recent International Social Science Survey as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last month. It finds that an increasing proportion of Australians think that Australia is a relatively egalitarian country. The authors of the study say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no sign here that recent economic reforms have polarised Australian society. If anything, they seem to have led more people to see Australia as a society offering abundant opportunity for a prosperous, middle-class life.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that the Australian people know the truth. They know that under this government there has been massive and spectacular job growth; there has been a very successful and substantial increase in social security payments, particularly family payments, especially payments that are targeted to low income families; and there has been a reformed, more equitable tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as those things, there has been an enormous increase in the social wage: Medicare, child care, education participation, superannuation and others. The Australian people know that this is the record of a government that is really committed to a more equal society and that the opposition's claims are measurably rubbish. They know the opposition's policies would only increase that inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Senator Colston asks about recently published OECD figures and a report about the inequality comparisons with OECD countries. That report clearly gives the lie to opposition claims that the top 20 per cent of income earners in this country earn 10 times as much as the bottom 20 per cent. In fact, the ratio is four to one, less than half of that claimed by the Leader of the National Party. In addition, the report shows that Australians have the most progressive system of income taxation and the most progressive social security system amongst the OECD countries in the study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of features of the report lead to the report actually understating Australia's true position compared with that of other countries. For one thing, the study did not include indirect taxes, which Australia relies on much less than other OECD countries. Nor does it include spending on the social wage: health, education and the like&mdash;a point we have constantly raised in this place but which you over there choose to ignore. Nor does the report include home ownership. Australia has the highest and the most equitably distributed level of home ownership amongst the countries in the study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take all these things into account, there is very clear support for the idea that Australia is one of the most egalitarian countries in the world, with a government second to none in its commitment to a fair go for all and a fair distribution of the wealth and skills in this country. The Australian people know it. It is about time the opposition faced it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am personally certainly very familiar with the Carnarvon transmitter because the Carnarvon transmitter was directly established to replace the transmitters that were destroyed in Darwin during Cyclone Tracy in 1974.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to provide additional funding to the ABC of $6.2 million in 1995-96, in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 for the operation of the Australian Television Service. That is a total of $18.6 million over those three years. The government has further agreed to savings of $2 million per annum from 1996-97 onwards from Radio Australia's transmission costs deriving from the closure of the Carnarvon transmission facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have specific advice, I am afraid, as to whether actual tests have been conducted at the facility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capacity at the Shepparton and Darwin sites, which were recently upgraded at a cost of $12 million, will permit continued coverage of the Indonesian region, including East Timor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Carnarvon facility was actually established in 1975 to compensate for the loss of the transmitters in Darwin during Cyclone Tracy. It has the highest operational costs of the NTA's four short-wave transmission facilities at $4.9 million per annum and it would have required capital expenditure of $2 million to $3 million in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to any proposals with other international broadcasters, Radio Australia will continue to have the ability to develop cooperative arrangements with other broadcasters for the leasing of on-air time at the NTA's remaining short-wave transmission facilities consistent with Australia's foreign policy and international transmission interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important public debate, and the media coverage is also important. As I said some weeks ago, because this is so important&mdash;and nothing could be more important than the quarantine protection of vital Australian industries&mdash;it would be something of a relief if the debate was centred on facts rather than fiction. I am sure Senator Boswell is genuinely interested in what I have to say about this. The article was largely based on Senator Boswell's claims to similar effect the other day in Senate estimates. Indeed, Senator Boswell is quoted in the article. He has given an undertaking to the committee to provide a list of the pests and diseases to support those statistics. I have been following up the claim since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the coverage has been hysterical and a lot of it has been poorly based on facts. Sadly, the article just referred to falls into this category, because it is based on the information that Senator Boswell provided to the committee. The article claims that exotic pest and disease outbreaks in Australia have almost tripled over the past five years, which is precisely the assertion Senator Boswell made to the committee. That assertion is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the policy guidance given by the government on the cost efficiency exercises that were conducted in AQIS&mdash;and the coalition strongly urged that those cost cutting exercises be conducted in AQIS&mdash;was that the quarantine barrier services were not impacted on negatively. So the connection between this supposed increase in disease and the cuts in AQIS staff simply does not stand up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reductions in AQIS staff&mdash;and this can be demonstrated, as Senator Boswell knows&mdash;have been principally on the export inspection side of AQIS's services, particularly meat inspection, where a range of measures has been adopted to improve the efficiency of the service. These include the introduction of quality assurance systems under which the companies assume responsibilities for a range of inspection processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the barrier protection side, reductions in staffing have been taken only where they have not impacted on the efficacy of the programs, principally again as a result of the introduction of new technologies. These include automated systems for clearance of cargo and the introduction of mobile teams with modern communication equipment. Of course, at the airports, where there have been significant increases in passenger movements, AQIS have actually increased the number of staff working in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparison of pest and disease detection in recent years with those of earlier periods as a measure of quarantine effectiveness is a fundamentally flawed comparison. Of the 13 plant related pests and diseases referred to as detected since 1990&mdash;these are the ones on the list and the ones Senator Boswell refers to&mdash;at least six entered Australia many years prior to detection, in some cases up to 40 years ago. For example, dry wood timber borer&mdash;and it is on the list&mdash;which was listed as being detected in 1990 was in fact first discovered in Queensland in 1952. One disease, pawpaw ringspot&mdash;God preserve us all from that&mdash;has since turned out to be almost certainly the mutation of an existing virus. Others like spiralling white fly have in fact been spread by natural means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The animal related diseases on the list appear to include three outbreaks of diseases known to have been introduced naturally by migrating water birds&mdash;avian influenza and Japanese encephalitis. Other detections also do not reflect a breakdown in quarantine.

Senator Watson's question, with due respect to Senator Watson, was about the dividend. The issue that has been raised around this matter has been, given the size of the dividend, whether that affects the other work that Telstra is doing. One of the key elements of the other work that Telstra is doing is rolling out its digitisation network.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point worth making here is that Telstra is a very effective and efficient operation. It does pay a substantial dividend to the Australian people because of that efficiency. That is what we as the shareholders on behalf of the Australian people, if you like, expect it to do while maintaining a highly competitive operation itself. What this government has done by introducing competition in telecommunications has been to ensure greater efficiencies and greater savings to the Australian community, who are users of this service. That is a positive change introduced by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I juxtapose that against the opposition's intention of auctioning off Telstra and selling it to the private sector, and probably to a foreign company. That would just not be in the national interest. Where you need a national carrier such as Telstra to provide the services that it does to areas where the cost factor alone is not the only determinant but where communities in remote locations require a high quality service and cannot afford those costs, you require a government owned carrier like Telstra in competition with the private sector to ensure that you have both the profit to the community and the spread of services properly managed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate calls on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to show national leadership by removing the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) following the findings of the Marks Royal Commission that she lied and otherwise acted improperly.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion is absolutely necessary today, particularly after what was, I regret to say, one of the most offensive answers that I have heard from a government minister in this place, and that was from Senator Robert Ray. Senator Ray, in answer to my question, basically said that the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) intended to disregard the findings of this royal commission because the government regarded it as an inquisition and a Star Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an offensive thing to say in relation to former Judge Marks&mdash;a person of high public standing who, in the public interest, undertook this task and acted with great dignity and great restraint despite enormous provocation within his commission and the most offensive attacks by the Prime Minister of this country. Never in the history of this country has a Prime Minister attacked a royal commissioner during his commission in a way that Prime Minister Keating attacked this man. It was one of the worst attacks to undermine the credibility of a commission that we have experienced. I start by quoting the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 28 August 1995. It was Mr Keating who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I insist that, in the performance of their public duties, in their dealings with the public and in the parliament, ministers tell the truth and behave honestly at all times.</PARA>
<PARA>He insisted that `ministers tell the truth and behave honestly at all times'. Now the finding is that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) not only lied but otherwise behaved improperly. Who is the first person to renege upon that undertaking given in the parliament on 28 August? Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not surprising, because the Prime Minister had predetermined his attitude to the findings of the commission, whatever they might have been. You will remember not that long ago&mdash;in fact on 25 August&mdash;when asked about the potential findings of the commission, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course we'll reject them; it's a kangaroo court. It's a crook commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Again on 15 May 1995, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So even if the thing `found against Carmen'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the `thing' happens to be the royal commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it doesn't matter a tinker's cuss.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister had indicated&mdash;even before the findings were brought down&mdash;that, if the findings were against the interests of his minister, Carmen Lawrence, he had no intention at all of respecting them. It is not surprising then that, when the royal commission's report was brought down yesterday and the findings were damning in relation to Minister Lawrence, the Prime Minister immediately said that he would take no notice of them. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was conceived in political malice. It was constituted with extravagance and partiality . . . an act of political malevolence by the Court Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He said, `We will disregard it.' That is a convenience for this Prime Minister. He said, `If we don't like the composition of the commission or its findings, we are entitled to disregard it.' That is after he got up in the parliament and said, `I expect my ministers to tell the truth.' It is his failure to stand up and meet his own claimed standards and his failure now to take a lead that forces us to bring this action today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has really moved on beyond Minister Lawrence herself. The public will make their judgment on her in the light of the findings made against her. The real issue now is what position the Prime Minister will take. Will he demonstrate for once a level of national leadership? Will he demonstrate that ministers within his government are expected to tell the truth and are expected to behave in a way in which the community can have confidence in them? Of course, when the test was put to him in those terms&mdash;because it was politically inconvenient for him to meet that test in a positive way&mdash;he said, `I will disregard the findings.' Right from the start, he indicated that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, you will recall the attempts by this government to discredit the commission right from the start. Firstly, there were attempts within the court, using taxpayers' money, to try to close down the commission&mdash;they took the matter to the most senior courts in this land but were unsuccessful. Then there were the attempts to attack the motivation of the commission&mdash;which were totally irrelevant actually&mdash;on the basis that it was a Western Australian commission set up under the Western Australian Royal Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that did not work, the Prime Minister then sought to attack the royal commissioner himself. As I have already indicated, there is little that is more offensive than a Prime Minister, with his whole public profile and standing, attacking a royal commissioner who is simply doing his job in the public calling. When that attack did not work, Senator Gareth Evans came in here and attacked the counsel assisting the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray today accused this royal commission&mdash;and therefore the commissioner&mdash;of behaving as if it were a Star Chamber. There has been only one other occasion when I have regarded the words of a minister in this place as being more offensive&mdash;when Senator Evans not too long ago attacked the counsel assisting the royal commissioner on this matter on the basis that she was related to a Liberal parliamentarian through marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was most highly offensive, but it demonstrates the extent to which this Prime Minister will go to avoid his leadership responsibility on this issue. I can only say that I am saddened that he seems to have so much power and influence over Senator Ray that Senator Ray would stoop to the level he did&mdash;the level of a Prime Minister who has clearly lost any sense of national responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said in my supplementary question today&mdash;after Senator Robert Ray asked whether there was a reason why the government should take note of the commissioner's findings&mdash;was that, yes, there was a reason. The overwhelming balance of evidence was consistent with the royal commissioner's findings, and the overwhelming balance of that evidence came from Labor Party people&mdash;from former Labor ministers, from colleagues of Carmen Lawrence and from her own staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all remember how distressed these individuals were when they were giving evidence before this royal commission, but they had no choice because under oath they would say the truth. What they said was that Carmen Lawrence was lying. One after another, they, Labor people, came before the royal commission and said Carmen Lawrence had lied to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did not lie once. She lied and lied and lied and lied. She lied to the National Press Club because when the same issues were put to her in the parliament and she was asked whether she stood by what she said at the press club, she avoided answering the question. In other words, she believes telling the truth to the parliament in some ways to avoid the technicality of lying to a parliament and the consequences is more important than telling the truth to the Australian people. If that is her standard, she will be judged by that standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real issue here, as I said, is: what will the Prime Minister do about it? Will he indicate that this is not a standard that he will accept? Previous leaders of the Labor Party would have so acted. I cannot imagine Gough Whitlam behaving in the way that this Prime Minister has in these circumstances. I cannot imagine Bob Hawke behaving that way. I remember when his then Minister Brown had to go because he misled the parliament, maybe inadvertently, maybe not. Nevertheless, Hawke said that if you mislead the parliament&mdash;in other words, if it is an untruth&mdash;you have to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But none of that is in the ballpark with what Carmen Lawrence has done. What she has done was to avoid political difficulty for herself in the circumstances of the Western Australian government at that time. She sought to find a diversionary opportunity. That diversionary opportunity was to pick up a matrimonial matter, a private matrimonial matter, and to exploit it within the parliament to her benefit without concern about the interests of the family concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>royal commissioner put that down in black and white before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of course that has been disregarded by the Prime Minister as well because he does not care two hoots. He in turn has a political interest at a difficult time to maintain the integrity in terms of the whole of his government. In other words, `It is too politically awkward at this time to sack Carmen Lawrence and therefore I, Mr Keating, am not going to sack her no matter what she has done. Whether she has lied and lied and lied again, I will not sack her.' By not taking that action, he, the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, condemns himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the arrangements I must come to a conclusion. What I wanted to say, however, is that I thought it was put so well today by another Labor man, former Western Australian Labor minister Keith Wilson. What did he say, a man of very high public standing? I do not think even Senator Ray will object to this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that the commissioner has come out with a thoroughly objective assessment of what has occurred. I think it is an assessment that should be accepted by everybody.</PARA>
<PARA>He is a former Labor minister in Western Australia, but he is a realist. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't really think that the outcome of this inquiry will be what it should be because I think the Prime Minister has very successfully scuttled it by enforcing his own questionable ethics on his federal colleagues and on others.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem. The Prime Minister has forced his questionable ethics upon his ministers and none of them will stand up and now say that lies by a minister are intolerable.

When Mr Gyles QC finally asked halfway through the commission, `Look, commissioner, what is this really about? What are the charges against my client?' the commissioner responded, `If you don't know what it's about, then you'll have to work it out for yourself.' That was straight out of Kafka's trial&mdash;`It is up to you to know what the charges are; I am not about to tell you; you should know what the charges are; just because you are a QC you should know what is going to be brought against your client; you should anticipate it', et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the moment Commissioner Marks made that statement, he should have given it away there and then.

They are the protestations that have been made. That defence is as false as just about everything else Dr Lawrence has said on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain why that is the case. How did this matter start? Why did we end up having a royal commission into this matter?

We found plenty more of her Labor colleagues saying that she must have lied. It was her colleagues&mdash;people who worked with her daily, people who knew her well&mdash;not Liberals who perhaps had some interest in bringing her down. You would have thought that her Labor colleagues, former mates and people she worked with, would have bent over backwards to support her.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was condemned not by a Liberal witch-hunt but out of the mouths of her own colleagues and, if one bothers to read the report, out of her own mouth, and now by the royal commissioner. The royal commissioner was at pains to say that he was not relying on hearsay evidence. There was plenty there, yes, but he was not relying on it. At page 59 of the report, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was, however, other evidence which strongly undermined the credibility of Dr Lawrence. It did not depend on belief or disbelief of another witness, but solely on what she herself said.</PARA>
<PARA>Anybody who bothers to read the report will see that that is how Dr Lawrence stands condemned today&mdash;out of the mouths of her colleagues, her staff, her former friends and out of her own mouth by her lack of credibility before the commission. So let us not hear that this is a Liberal witch-hunt. Why don't you write a letter? Let us go and tell Kovacs, Willoughby, Imms, Sullivan, Estelle Blackburn, Marcelle Anderson, seven cabinet ministers and Kobelke that they are all liars and they are in some sort of Liberal plot to get their former boss and their former mate. That is how she stands condemned&mdash;out of the mouths of Labor members, not out of the mouths of Liberal members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This royal commission was set up and we had the usual approach we get from Labor: `If you can't run it, wreck it. Start off from the very beginning. Say anything and do anything to undermine the commission.' That is exactly what happened from the moment it was announced that a commission was going to be held. We had bully boy warnings from the Prime Minister, saying, `Any judge or former judge who takes part in this will never get a job from us. The same applies to anybody who takes a job as counsel assisting. You watch out because if you want to participate in this commission and one of our members is at risk, sooner or later we will get you. We will fix you up and you certainly won't get any jobs out of us.' That was the message. Then we move to vicious attacks on both the commissioner and counsel assisting.

Why don't you rearrange the whole commission to suit me? After all, I have to go to Beijing. I'm very important.' She is a very important woman. She rearranged the whole witness structure to suit her because she changed her mind. Let's get real about this. She was called in the week in which she asked to be called.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A clearly angry Dr Lawrence said that anyone whose views concurred with hers was not believed while the memories of others who didn't were favoured.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who reads the commission report will be left in no doubt as to the veracity of the commissioner's findings that Dr Lawrence was untruthful and acted improperly. Fourteen persons, including seven cabinet members&mdash;they were Labor supporters&mdash;contradicted her claim of non-involvement. What are these people? Liars? People we have bought off? Is this the claim you want to make? The evidence of those whose evidence was not inconsistent with Dr Lawrence's was fully considered by the commission. It was overwhelmingly against Dr Lawrence in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eight people present said that Dr Lawrence did raise the Easton matter, which she denied. Seven others were somewhat equivocal, but of those seven only one said she was sure she would have remembered if it happened and even she conceded she may have left the meeting and would not know. None of the others were any help to Dr Lawrence at all. Smith refused to answer, Edwards was not present, Bridge left the meeting, Hill left early, the remaining three said they did not remember but conceded they might not have been present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we end up with? Eight ministers saying, yes, it happened, and of the other seven, one feeble bit of support for Dr Lawrence's position. Let us not hear any rubbish that this is some Liberal plot to get to Dr Lawrence. She is condemned out of the mouths of her former colleagues,  workmates and her own staff. That should tell you something. As the commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It goes without saying that each of the persons eligible to be present at the meeting at which Dr Lawrence spoke on 2 November was a supporter of her government and might be expected to be reluctant to give evidence damaging to Dr Lawrence and the political party to which they are or were committed.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the people who gave the evidence that is now so damning to Dr Lawrence. In any event, the commission was set up and, I think, properly conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here this afternoon is an attempt to say that it was not. We have had Senator Ray saying that they took hearsay evidence. So do lots of courts. So do lots of commissions. But if you read the report you will understand that it was not relied on. Senator Ray does not bother to make that point. Senator Ray's contribution concentrated on anything but the facts as revealed by Dr Lawrence's Labor colleagues. And those facts were that she lied and that she acted improperly. Everything else is absolutely irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be appropriate to concentrate, just for the moment, on what the commissioner did actually find. Firstly, he found that Dr Lawrence was untruthful. I notice plenty of people on this side are seeking to say that memories differ. If you accept that somehow all these other people have a recollection that is incorrect and that it is only Dr Lawrence that has the true version, you could let her off for lying, if you were prepared to be so stupid. You could but, in any event, when the weight of evidence says that the facts show that this meeting was held and that these discussions took place and reveals the involvement she did have in this matter, even if you let her off the lying charge you cannot let her off for behaving improperly. You simply cannot unless you want to say that all of her former Labor colleagues who spoke against her are in some way acting to bring her down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence's conduct was judged to be improper because she supported the use of Easton's grievances and allegations for her own personal interest. She falsely denied to the public her knowledge of and participation in those events and in doing so she deprived the citizens of Western Australia of their right and freedom to discuss and judge what it was she was choosing to do as a minister and as a premier. That is the very basis of our parliamentary system. The public must be free to know what happens, free to understand what has happened and free to judge accordingly&mdash;give you a tick in the box for a stay in government and out of the box if you are not going to stay in government. That system will not work if the public are not allowed to know what has happened. And they will not know what has happened if they are not told the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now the truth is out and now we have to decide what to do. Labor has clearly decided what to do. They decided what to do the day this commission was announced&mdash;rubbish the commission. It is the only thing they can do if they want to keep Dr Lawrence. So they decided to say that a former judge with extensive experience&mdash;calling witnesses, judging the credibility of witnesses, marshalling a lot of facts, deciding the truth of matters&mdash;someone who has made a career of this, has somehow got it wrong. They said, `We are going to rubbish him because he does not like Dr Lawrence. He has drawn bad conclusions about her.' You could do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there have been some weak in the community&mdash;very weak, in my view&mdash;who choose to ignore the findings. They do so out of some misguided view that because Dr Lawrence is a successful female parliamentarian, because she is a role model to other women, we should forgive her almost anything. I have actually read one feminist view that she should be forgiven everything because she is a positive role model for young women. Like hell she is! I do not want young women coming into parliament learning that it is appropriate to lie, to behave improperly and still keep your job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not accept the misguided view that we can accept lower standards from women to keep more women in. I think that is rubbish. It is an insult to every woman here and any who want to come in future. Quite the opposite: I would claim that when more women are here the standards in this place will rise, but certainly not if the likes of Dr Lawrence keep their positions. So they are the first two choices: just rubbish the commission or ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third choice is to act on the findings. If you read the report, you will get a very clear outline of the basis of our representative democracy, if you do not already understand it. The commissioner rightly identifies the basis of that&mdash;that power lies with the people, that the parliamentarians act in a sense as trustees of that power and they must therefore act in good faith and be honest with the people so that people can judge whether we keep our jobs or whether we get the sack. In order to do that, they must have the information. That is what freedom of information is all about. And you do not have freedom of information if ministers lie about what they have done. If premiers lie about what they have done, then the public cannot possibly have a proper chance of saying whether someone should keep their job or not. They cannot properly participate in the parliamentary process if ministers are allowed to lie about what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should we have to act? Should we have to consider this motion today? Certainly not. I do not fancy myself as weak. I do not think I am weak-kneed at all, but I will tell you this: if this report was about me I would not be showing my face in public for several weeks, I would not be able to put out my hand and take a cheque from the taxpayer as pay for doing my job and I would be far too embarrassed to come in and take a seat in the chamber, let alone on the front bench.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is sad that the commissioner accepted those terms. During the royal commission, he said how restrictive they were and commented on the very limiting nature those terms imposed on his inquiry. The first thing to know about this royal commission is that the terms were written by her political enemies for a political purpose. Not surprisingly, those terms prevented the royal commission from looking at Mr Richard Court's conduct in this affair. He is a leading actor in this whole sorry story, but that was put away from judicial scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point about these terms, of course, is that, with Mr Richard Court out of the way and unable to be examined, the issue of Dr Carmen Lawrence was seen in isolation. I repeat that I believe Dr Carmen Lawrence to be a truthful person and this to be a judgment of error. I think it absolutely wrong that it should be visited upon Dr Carmen Lawrence that she started this affair. The record is true, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>of the Western Australian parliament reveals that. The people who started this affair were Mr Richard Court and Mr Ross Lightfoot. That is a matter of public record.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commissioner himself has expressed his opinion about this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That's mainly because I do regard myself as independent and here to perform a judicial function.</PARA>
<PARA>He is not performing a judicial function. Nonetheless, he ran it as if he were performing a trial. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of reference have turned out, of course, to be fairly restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA>Even this commissioner recognises the restrictive nature of the terms of reference and says so on the record. He goes on: The fact is that I took on the task of being a royal commissioner without actually realising the storm that was likely to be unleashed or the issues that might be sought to be canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, he was reflecting on the fact that he may well have entered into this office not acknowledging the circumstances in which he had invited himself in. That therefore goes to the credibility of his findings in this case. He says again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sooner this commission comes to an end the better. I think that the experience here has demonstrated that the usefulness of royal commissions is fast receding.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that that is exactly true. If royal commissions are used for base political purposes and not for getting at the truth, and they are used as weapons in political conflict and not as efforts in discovering information, then royal commissions are misconstrued, misused and misapplied and should be disregarded. He then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has made virtually the result of this commission probably open to some doubt.</PARA>

There is no sifting of the evidence by saying, `Well, on this hand or on that hand, considering these circumstances, I therefore come to this view'. He just declares it. There is a declaration that `This is my view' without any justification behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of an inquiry is to get at the facts and sift the reasons. There was no effort to do so on this occasion.

They are well-conducted, upright individuals. I know Joe Berinson better than I know Ross Love. Joe Berinson is a man who would die rather than mislead anyone, but his evidence is not analysed; it is lightly put aside because his evidence in fact confirms the Lawrence recollections.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a royal commission in the normal sense. There was no allegation that Carmen Lawrence endangered national security, that Carmen Lawrence misconducted herself in public office, that Carmen Lawrence financially mismanaged the state, that Carmen Lawrence got personal gain from what she did or that she endangered the public interest. There was an allegation that, in circumstances where there is conflicting recollection, she lied, and I do not believe that that is at all true. This royal commission was got up to assassinate her character, and I am not surprised that it has now achieved that result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude on this matter, Madam Deputy President. The precedent of using a royal commission in this manner is something that the parties in this chamber and in other parliaments of Australia should pause and think seriously about. We have had a qualitative change in the role of royal commissions here. This royal commission is not about any of those things I mentioned a moment ago that normally you would have a royal commission into; this is a royal commission into a political foe in order to bring that political foe down and to accuse them of impropriety in office. If that becomes a tradition, then there are lots of other royal commissions in this country that could easily be slated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the evidence of one day, today, about that.

Howard was asked on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program why, as treasurer in the 1983 election campaign, he had stuck to a budget deficit prediction of $6 billion even after Treasury informed him it would be $9 billion. Howard replied: "The $9.6 billion figure I was in fact told the night before the election."</PARA>
<PARA>Oakes goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was "Honest John" fudging things. The truth is that the then Treasury secretary John Stone met Howard on Monday, February 28, five days before the election, and advised him the projected deficit was about $9 billion. There was plenty of time to come clean.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook says that there has been a qualitative change in the use of royal commissions in this country. In the Democrats' view, the circumstances surrounding the debate today highlight what we see as a qualitative change in the political morality, or at least the kind of conventions, that we operate under in politics in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three symptoms of this new political `morality'. The first symptom is the extraordinary use of a royal commission, the second is the politicisation of a family law matter and the third is the new `tough it out at all costs' model of ministerial responsibility and accountability. The Democrats do not like or accept any of these features, but the contest is being conducted under these rules, and that fact makes it very difficult to reach a clear resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a black-and-white matter. The first complicating factor is the jurisdictional argument, the overlap of the actions of the same person: in the first instance, a premier in a state parliament, and after that a federal minister in this parliament&mdash;in the state parliament a premier accused of misleading a parliament. I have raised this point previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jurisdictional argument may sound technical, but I think it raises an important question. If a politician moves from one jurisdiction to another, as is happening frequently these days, does that politician take with him or her the baggage from the last position? We do not have an answer to that under our new political morality, but in this particular case the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, herself made a link between the two jurisdictions. I see that link as Dr Lawrence's Press Club appearance. I believe it was initiated by her to defend her position in the light of the Easton matter resurfacing through the comments of the former Labor minister, Mr Keith Wilson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason this is not a black-and-white issue concerns the matter of the tainting of process. In the Democrats' view, that started the day that Richard Court decided to move from the traditional, respected use of royal commissions, whereby we respected their authority and, consequently, their conclusions. Following on from that, we have seen an array of actions&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) attacking the credibility of the commissioner and seeking in advance to undermine his findings, and the commissioner, apparently feeling the political pressure from both sides, acknowledging himself the politicisation of his commission and seeking to extend, and succeeding in extending, the grounds of inquiry. We have seen the government attacking the counsel assisting for being related to the shadow Attorney-General, an attack I said at the time&mdash;and I still believe&mdash;had no foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all of this did, in my view, was turn the royal commission, from day one, into political theatre. Despite that, I cannot say that the entire episode, with all the reservations and qualifications I have expressed, does not raise serious questions about Dr Lawrence's fitness for federal office. I think it does raise those questions. The best construction you can put on this episode is that a senior minister, a serious contender for the Deputy Prime Minister's job, was pursued, for purely political motivations, in her home state. The worst construction is that, despite a flawed process, Commissioner Marks's findings are correct&mdash;that Dr Lawrence has lied and, what I think is worse, has maintained a lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I did not have such serious question marks about the process, I would be able to say categorically that I believe Dr Lawrence should be sacked. But the question marks remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clear is that there has been a great cost&mdash;a cost apart from the millions of dollars to the taxpayers of Western Australia and federally. The cost has been to the credibility of a senior politician, a state Premier, the future of royal commissions and, most importantly, the political and parliamentary processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must make us ask the question: do the last 12 years of Labor government and does the shift to the `tough it out at all costs' model of ministerial accountability now mean that ultimately there will be no ministerial accountability and that the only limit is what you can get away with and how tough you are seen to be while you are doing it. The new morality prescribes, in our view, a much greater value to being seen to be tough than being seen to be honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All around Australia today some people are saying that Dr Lawrence lied and others are saying that it was a witch-hunt. I can only repeat the Democrats' view: if these findings had been reached by a different process, by a less tainted, less flawed and less politicised process, then we could have all just about agreed that that would be sufficient cause to call for a minister's resignation. But the fact is that the process was tainted, it was flawed and it was politicised. </PARA>

I want to say that the entire episode has brought parliament and politicians into even further disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the reality of this existing political morality is that the fate of Carmen Lawrence will be decided by herself, by the Labor Party and by the electors of Fremantle.

We do need a clear shift away from this `tough it out at all costs' model of ministerial accountability. It is an unacceptable model.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 May 1995, Commissioner Marks was appointed to be a royal commissioner to inquire into and report on whether the circumstances and events preceding and following the presentation of a petition to the Legislative Council of the Parliament of Western Australia on 5 November 1992 by the Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this royal commission is about. It came about as a result of a call for an independent inquiry into this whole affair.

Also Keith Wilson, a former Carmen Lawrence minister, called for an inquiry. So it was not just Richard Elliott in the backroom, as Senator Cook maintains, or Richard Court trying to get even.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Campbell says, there was a call by Barbara Campbell, Penny Easton's mother. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper summed up the comment by Commissioner Marks. It was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preservation of our system of government depends on the preservation of public power to learn the truth of events in which there is community interest. The power needs to be strengthened, not weakened.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this royal commission was about. This royal commission went to the heart of how public office should be used. I can think of no better reason for the calling of a royal commission than that. But let us look at the facts. Let us sift through the facts and get the reasons, as Senator Cook says. Firstly, we look to the finding that Commissioner Marks made. At page 115 of this report he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances the conduct of Dr Lawrence in the use of her office as Premier was improper :</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) in supporting the use of Easton's grievances and allegations for her own personal interests at the expense of the interests of the parties to the Easton matrimonial dispute and members of their families;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) in falsely denying to the public her knowledge of, and participation in, the events and circumstances preceding the presentation of the petition;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) in depriving the public of its right and freedom to discuss and judge her participation in the relevant events by untruthfully denying the existence of that participation.</PARA>
<PARA>I can see no more serious damnation of a politician than that. This was a thoroughly thought-out report which exceeded 130 pages. This commission was conducted in an erudite fashion by a former judge of Victoria whose credentials were impeccable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Cook has suggested, I will now sift through the facts. It is interesting to note that Commissioner Marks found that not only did he have to rely on 14 witnesses who refuted Dr Lawrence's evidence&mdash;14 witnesses whom he found had no motivation to find that she was untruthful, they being either supporters of her previous government or ministers, and I believe some seven of them were ministers in her government&mdash;but also on her own words she was damned. He also said there was other evidence which strongly undermined the credibility of Dr Lawrence. It did not depend on belief or disbelief of any other witness, but solely on what she said herself. He pointed to the National Press Club. On 19 April this year Dr Lawrence stated to the Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I clearly want to debunk the claim that I seized on this petition as a way to deflect attention from a police inquiry into my imprest account. The fact is that by the day before the tabling of the petition I was already aware that the inquiry was completed and that I would be exonerated and I checked that detail with the lawyer involved yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Marks found, on the irrefutable evidence before him, that on the day before the tabling of the petition Dr Lawrence could not have been already aware that she would be exonerated because the decision not to charge her was not made by the police commissioner until the day following the tabling. She could not be mistaken about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also found that in a doorstop interview on 10 April she had said that Keith Wilson was mistaken. She recalled a discussion about the tabling of the petition; but it was not on 2 November 1992, three days before the tabling, it was after that. The Marks report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of any such discussion after 5 November in Cabinet or Caucus or elsewhere was extensively explored by counsel for Dr Lawrence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They could not find any event which matched that description. Therefore, it was that Commissioner Marks found:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence clearly fabricated the later discussion thesis as a device for nullifying Wilson's contention without accusing him of lying, which was potentially damaging politically. Wilson commanded a degree of respect. She gambled against the emergence of evidence which put paid to the suggestion that the same conversation occurred after the petition was tabled.</PARA>
<PARA>So by her own words was she condemned. This well thought out report does not jump to conclusions but sifts through the facts, as Senator Cook said, and it comes to very cogent reasons indeed. But if you do not think that is enough, look to her seven former ministers who said that it was discussed in cabinet prior to the tabling and look to the seven other people who worked for her government who said that it was discussed with her prior to the tabling. Contrast that with the answer she gave in the parliament of Western Australia on 10 November 1992, when she was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did the Premier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Carmen Lawrence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have any knowledge of the petition tabled in the other place by the Hon. John Halden prior to its tabling at 2.35 p.m. Thursday 5 November and, if so, when?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Lawrence replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a matter that must be dealt with extremely carefully, and I hope all members of the House will do so. I did not see that in the evidence earlier this afternoon it is the case that the Hon. John Halden presented the petition to the House and as I understand it he has made a clear and detailed statement this afternoon of the process involved in that.</PARA>
<PARA>She was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you know about it prior to the petition being tabled?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Lawrence replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After discussions with the petitioner on the advice of the clerk of the Legislative Council, the Hon. John Halden adopted the process and tabled the petition at a time of his choosing. I was informed that he was to do that and I learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling.</PARA>
<PARA>What she said there was that she maintained that she learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. That is at clear odds with what happened&mdash;clear odds with what those other witnesses said took place. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 23 March 1993 Janine Cohen asked her for the purpose of her article published in June 1993 in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Magazine</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"You didn't know about the details in the petition?"</PARA>
<PARA>Carmen Lawrence said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"No. God, if I had I wouldn't have let them go near it, that's the point isn't it, surely . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course she would not have let them go near it. Nobody would have if they had known what was involved. That went to the absolute root of this inquiry: the question of propriety in office. What Carmen Lawrence has done here is to compound her position by repeatedly untruthfully stating what she knew, because she states that she did not know the detail and the thrust of this petition. Yet, on her own words, as I have outlined from the report by Commissioner Marks, and on the words of 14 witnesses, who had no motivation to lie, she was found to be untruthful. You can understand that the press would be saying such things as what Michelle Grattan said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If Lawrence is thinking of anything more than her own skin, she must be feeling God awful. First, she has been labelled untruthful by a judicial inquiry. The fact that inquiry was established as a political hatchet job doesn't offset the impact of being called a liar, because the weight of evidence supported the conclusion."</PARA>
<PARA>The heading of the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> reads `Lawrence fails the test of truth'. Indeed, in other reports across the nation we find the press, too, were unimpressed. The editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Marks Royal Commission has branded federal health minister, Dr Carmen Lawrence, a liar. Decency would normally dictate she step down as a minister of the Crown. But, in keeping with latter day political morality, both the government and Dr Lawrence are determined to ignore propriety and tough it out.</PARA>
<PARA>And there is more. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even allowing for the intensely political nature of the royal commission and the restrictiveness of its terms of reference, it is hard to escape the conclusion that they are not the sort of MPs in whom people can have much confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is where this all lies. This commission was set up to look at the probity in the exercise of executive power and the use of public office. The findings of Commissioner Marks are cogent, they are relevant and they are damning for Dr Lawrence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was a time to use the word `witch-hunt', it has appropriately been used here. It is a witch-hunt by a party that has set out to attack a brilliant and successful woman, because a brilliant and successful woman they cannot cope with. It is a point that I think needs to be made very strongly. The opposition cannot cope with the brilliant and successful woman that Dr Lawrence so exemplifies. It is a political party that even in the nineties still maintains a 1950s attitude and philosophy that women basically should be at home and not out in the work force or the community seeking other opportunities. It is a party still prejudiced against women. </PARA>

I know from what Senator Crowley is saying that she does not want to discuss the motion that deals solely with the issue of whether Mr Keating should act honourably and sack a minister who has been disgraced and called a liar by a judicial inquiry or royal commission. Senator Crowley is seeking to say that this motion is in some way sexist and that, because the minister who was found to be a liar is a woman, we are making this call and would not do so if she were a man. To then move into the subject area of what a deputy leader of a state organisation somewhere might have said about a preselection process and questions that one might be asked at a preselection have nothing to do with the substance of this motion. I would ask you to direct the minister to make her comments in this debate relevant at least in the broadest possible way to the motion before the chair, and not to some other issue that she has floating around in her hollow head.</PARA></TALK.START>

It goes to the points that just about every other speaker in this place has made for or against. Can you have any reliance on the conclusions of a political witch-hunt, particularly one that has set out to discredit and target a woman of the capacity and success of Dr Lawrence? It is clear evidence that the opposition is not comfortable at all with successful and brilliant women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite clear that it is entirely relevant to pick up on the points argued, I think very splendidly, by Senator Kernot that you have to put grave doubt on any conclusions from a tainted set-up. This is a tainted set-up. As Senator Robert Ray argued so brilliantly, it is nothing more than a fit-up. They set out to get her and that is what they intended to try to follow up. You can place no substance and no serious reliance on the outcome of it. Members of the opposition are not happy with successful women, so they set out to try to bring one down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the royal commission? I would like to make a few comments about this very expensive, something approaching $6 million, Monty Python show, effectively. I will refer to some of the comments from Commissioner Marks. He said on 9 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been put in a position which is probably irrecoverable in some senses because this inquiry has become almost impossible to control in an objective sense.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the commissioner speaking. The findings confirm that lack of objectivity. Mr Marks also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the present issues may give rise to the impression that I am going to make some political determination is a cause of some embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes indeed, great embarrassment, and so it has been. The commissioner has been used for blatant political purposes. Mr Marks went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience here has demonstrated that the usefulness of royal commissions is fast receding.</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely, particularly when in the past royal commissions have been set up for the reasons that were so well outlined by Senator Ray, none of which apply in this case. But the most important and revealing comment from Mr Marks is the quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The politics that seem to have emerged with all the controversy . . . has made virtually the result of this commission probably open to some doubt.</PARA>
<PARA>Not probably, Mr Commissioner Marks&mdash;absolutely. Beyond doubt it has been discredited by process, by the selection, and therefore the outcome is entirely in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone wanted to say in her comments that some of the people writing, particularly women, in support of Dr Lawrence wanted to suggest it was a question of forgiving her. I do not know whether some people want to argue that or not, but it is certainly not the case for me or this government. It is not a question of forgiving Carmen Lawrence; it is a question of asking and discrediting a royal commission that deliberately set out to target her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting too to note some of the quotes, and there are many I could give you on the public record today. I think these actually convey a very large sense of what the electorate will judge. A female caller who rang in to 2BL Sydney said about Dr Lawrence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe in her honesty. She was honest enough to say she couldn't recall. All the other people . . . even her deputy had an axe to grind against her . . . and all that should have been brought forward, and I'm proud of our Prime Minister, who's standing by a woman. All the women of Australia remember that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly right. Indeed, to close my comments, I think my last words on this issue should be from the Anglican Archbishop of Perth, who said on 19 October that the royal commission had undermined confidence in Western Australia's social and political system and the state looked stupid. The person who is discredited by this royal commission is Premier Court and the opposition. They cannot cope with brilliant women and they have set up a commission that has not sought the truth but is focused on a selection of targeted misrepresentations. It is a gross error in judgment by the opposition. I concur with the archbishop's assessment. </PARA>

She is a minister of the government, and a senior minister at that.

They are trying to destroy the messenger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are these. Whether or not Carmen Lawrence, a senior minister, misled the parliament, the media and the Australian people, 14 of her colleagues said she did. They were not Liberal or National Party colleagues: they were Labor colleagues. On page 130 of the royal commission, in the summary of the conclusions, there are some damning indictments. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was the first of at least four occasions before 5 November 1995 on which Dr Lawrence participated in discussions about the use of Easton's allegations. Contrary to the evidence of both Halden and Dr Lawrence, there was a briefing of Dr Lawrence by Halden late in the week preceding the petition's tabling.</PARA>
<PARA>So the conclusions go on for two pages that Carmen Lawrence misled the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen Lawrence was prepared to play the political game: discredit the opposition, and use a very questionable petition to do so&mdash;but then, because she got caught, to cry that she is a woman. The sex defence: I am a woman; you cannot attack me. And then her sister over there, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), says, `Don't attack Carmen Lawrence.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Carmen Lawrence wants to be a minister, she cannot hide behind a skirt. Her attitude was to take no prisoners and that all is fair in love and war. We know the game, we play it hard. All things are fair in this game, except one thing: lying to parliament and misleading the people. When you lie to parliament, you lie to the Australian people. Parliament represents the people. Misleading the House is lying to the people. Carmen Lawrence has misled not one parliament but two parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what her response was on the day after the petition was put down:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did the Premier have any knowledge of the petition tabled in the other place by John Halden prior to its tabling at 2.30 p.m. on Thursday 5 November; if so, when?</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Lawrence responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I learnt the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. That is the way it is, and that is the way I have explained the position.</PARA>
<PARA>Then on four occasions she misled the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter a fig whether she was trying to play politics when she used the petition, or whether we were trying to play politics when we established the royal commission. The facts are these: politics is a rough, tough game. Anything goes and no holds are barred, except one hold: you must never lie to parliament, ever. This is what our whole Westminster system depends on: ministers not lying in the house, not lying to the people. This is what our judicial system, including royal commissions, depends on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the last person to deny that Carmen Lawrence is an intelligent women. She was the hope of the Labor Party. She played the game fast and loose. She thought she could crash or crash through. Well, she has monumentally crashed out. She was going to tough it out; she was going to hide behind her skirt; she was going to hide behind the Prime Minister and all her colleagues locking tight around her. But she has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot, who has been often accused of being the fourth or the fifth wing of the Labor Party faction, and who has been seen arm in arm with Jennie George at the ACTU, the political wing of the Labor Party, gave every reason today to support Senator Hill's resolution of dismissing Carmen Lawrence or asking the Prime Minister to do so. She has failed and, I believe, by that failure locked herself in totally to being part of the Labor Party. She has totally forgone any reason for her existence&mdash;to keep the bastards honest, as was the slogan her founder used in one of his campaigns. That is finished and no longer can it be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the motion, 14 people of Labor Party persuasion said under oath that their recollection of events were reflected in the conclusions of the royal commission. As I said, that is why she is condemned. Many people have had to resign from the Labor Party because they have misled parliament. Ros Kelly resigned. Alan Griffiths resigned. Former Senator Richardson resigned. Mick Young resigned. All because they had misled parliament. On some occasions, I believe it was not a criminal offence, it was not a mortal sin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Carmen Lawrence has not misled parliament once; she has done it four times. She misled the media at a press conference. Four times in the House of Representatives she said she did not have any recollection of the events or her recollections were totally different from the recollections of her colleagues. No-one believes her, and you wonder why no-one believes her! No intelligent person would believe that Carmen Lawrence was not aware of the Easton petition before it was tabled in the parliament. The evidence of her own ministerial colleagues is conclusive. Her staff&mdash;staff are generally loyal to all of us&mdash;were not prepared to lie to the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Carmen Lawrence is not prepared to resign, then the Prime Minister of Australia must do what is right. If he is going to protect the integrity of his ministry, he has no alternative but to sack her. If he does not, then he is condoning a lie. If the Prime Minister wants to go down on record as being the first Prime Minister in Australia to condone a lie, then let him do it and let it be on his head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you what: this parliamentary system depends on one thing&mdash;the honesty and integrity of the ministers. In some cases I believe ministers who have been caught out may have made mistakes&mdash;the offences may not have been intended. Nevertheless, in this case it was intentional. Ten questions were asked of Carmen Lawrence in the House of Representatives day after day and we heard her denial day after day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again: the integrity of the Keating ministry is on the line. If he condones a lie, then he is condemned, his ministry is condemned and he is no better than Carmen Lawrence. It is irrelevant, as I have said, who did what and whether the petition was used as a political weapon to discredit Richard Court&mdash;and that is what happened and we know that. These things happen. But there is one thing that you cannot condone&mdash;that is, telling four lies to this parliament, a lie to the press, and a lie to the Western Australian Assembly.

<PARA>We on this side of the chamber have said that we take the approach that has been ascribed to Dr Lawrence's evidence, but I am talking now about the process that was used against her. It was a political process. That was seen and agreed to by Commissioner Marks. I do not want to comment on the character of Commissioner Marks, as has been done in some cases, but I do want to read what he says about this. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry necessarily threatened damage to persons associated with only one of the political parties and thus possible damage to the party itself. When evidence emerged which had the potential to damage that party a predictable attempt was made to meet it, not merely by the normal methods of challenge such as cross examination and evidence, but by the attempts to discredit and intimidate the Commission itself. Accordingly, the need for protection, which would require amending legislation, or legislation for differently empowered inquiries, is so much the greater.</PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Marks was saying that this was a political storm he was going into. What he wanted to do was arm himself with the sorts of privileges and powers that the courts have so that he could go into this political exercise. I have known Commissioner Marks for some years and have a liking for him. But in this context&mdash;and Senator Alston will confirm what I am about to say now&mdash;he should have remembered the rule that bound him as a judge pursuant to Chief Justice Irvine's letter that was sent to Premier Lawson in Victoria in August of 1923, which was not a political exercise, as the present one has been, according to Commissioner Marks. The chief justice said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is mainly due to the fact that, in modern times at least, the Judges in all British Communities have, except in rare cases, confined themselves to this function&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that means the judicial function&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that they have attained, and still retain, the confidence of the people. Parliament, supported by a wise public opinion, has jealously guarded the Bench from the danger of being drawn into the region of political controversy.</PARA>
<PARA>Political controversy is what you are drawn into. This is what this letter is all about&mdash;the danger of any royal commission being a political exercise. What is the situation in this particular case? This is the most political royal commission ever called in Australia. That is a very bad exercise of executive power and should not be encouraged.

I agree that this is not a legal case, but if this was a case in the courts you would also look at the process.

<PARA>He certainly has not given everything he has got to the job. He has given it to a lot of other people. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth. In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much is humanly possible.</PARA>
<PARA>What he has done, of course, is quite the opposite. He has dragged the standards of parliament and, indeed, Australian political debate and political life down to a very low level. The real message of this whole exercise is that, as far as the government is concerned, truth, honesty, integrity and other personal virtues are all expendable and are subordinate to party political interests. That is not a creed we espouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, Mr Keating, by his very lifestyle and practice, has made very clear that he leads a mob of politically moral bankrupts. He does not believe there is any place for morality in politics. Politics to him is simply the art of getting away with whatever you can. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that there is a high degree of cynicism when he sets the example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have done a lot of criminal trials in my time and, indeed, a lot of civil actions. I have had to sit through the calling of witnesses where it is, at the end of the day, quite often a tough call to decide between competing versions. That has certainly not been the case here. In many respects one can say that this is one of the clearest examples of the one-sided weight of the evidence simply overwhelming the person whose truthfulness is called into question. Not only can it be no surprise to anyone as an objective outsider; I think the only surprise is that Dr Lawrence and those who feel it their political obligation to support her have simply ignored the fundamentals of the hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should just pick up on one of the statements that was made by Senator Cook, in his usual dissembling and disingenuous way, when he suggested that a lot of the commentary was not in support of Dr Lawrence having lied or, indeed, the outcome of the royal commission. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> simply says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter why the commission was established. What counts is that it was a properly constituted legal tribunal at which a succession of Dr Lawrence's former Western Australian Cabinet colleagues and staff, on oath, overwhelmingly contradicted her version of events.</PARA>
<PARA>I was very disappointed that, when given the opportunity, Senator Kernot did not in any shape or form deal with that issue. She simply said that the editorials were divided and she therefore did not even attempt to address the issue. I think that is a sad reflection on the approach the Democrats have taken to this issue. But I will come to that a little later. The findings made by Mr Marks are absolutely damning. I will quote just three of them. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, it is the weight of the evidence in contradiction of Dr Lawrence's version that requires its disbelief.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence could not possibly have forgotten the pre-5 November discussions and briefing which were revealed by Kovacs, Willoughby, Marcelle Anderson, Kobelke and the members of Cabinet. Their evidence demonstrates that there were at least four occasions on which she participated in discussion about the Easton allegations.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a tendency among commentators, and among others, to attach less significance to lies by public figures because so many tell them so often. Prevalence of such misconduct does not excuse it or make it any less serious.</PARA>
<PARA>Those findings ought to be incontrovertible. Michelle Grattan says in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that Lawrence had an array of former colleagues and staffers ranged against her version of events&mdash;people who mostly had no reason to lie under oath. Too many people remembered her involved in discussions of the petition's substance before its tabling, flying in the face of her denials and protestations of no recollection.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .        . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may simply conclude that Carmen Lawrence played the game hard&mdash;in 1992 and when she got caught. Others will say she was initially unscrupulous, and then, when it came to choosing between her own good and that of the party, selfish.</PARA>
<PARA>Niki Savva in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most damning evidence came from Dr Lawrence's own lips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as her inability to recall dramatic events, such as the threat by her then deputy to resign over the issue, she raised disturbing questions about the standards she observed.</PARA>

<PARA>Margo Kingston in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>

<PARA>Geoff Kitney said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truly extraordinary thing about this whole affair is the damage that has been done to Dr Lawrence by the people who are supposed to be her political allies and friends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . none of it could have happened without the damning testimony of key people from Dr Lawrence's side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the crucial issue. And this is where the real damage is done to Dr Lawrence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her claim, measured against the evidence of the others, was simply not credible.</PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelming weight of opinion on the part of those commentators who follow these issues closely is that Carmen Lawrence does not have a leg to stand on. She lied. She lied repeatedly. She has lied her head off. She has done it to serve her own interests and those of her political party. She has refused to acknowledge the standards of propriety that ought to operate in Australian public life. She has simply demeaned the whole political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen Lawrence has not only been aided and abetted by the Prime Minister, but indeed her behaviour has also been condoned by him&mdash;indeed, I think a standard has been set by him. If it had not been for him, I think Dr Lawrence would have thrown in the towel when Gary Gray came to see her because she knew that her position was untenable, that her behaviour was intolerable and that her manner of denials was totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the way in which the royal commission conducted its hearings that could in any shape or form explain why people who were Carmen Lawrence's political allies felt the need to say what they said. I think the only explanation that one can come to is that, whilst there is a code of conduct in the Labor Party which will often see them closing ranks on a political issue, the fact is that on this occasion her colleagues simply could not stomach her squalid and sordid behaviour. They broke ranks because they were disgusted and outraged, and they felt they could not remain silent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this is all about. Everyone on the other side of politics knows that. This is simply rationalised away by them as some sort of toughing it out political stance that will justify the behaviour. That, of course, is the approach that the end justifies the means; it is the code that the Prime Minister has proclaimed for the Labor Party. I think there was a time when quite a number of people in the Labor Party would have felt political revulsion at that sort of behaviour but now, of course, they are locked in behind someone whose standards of morality have sunk lower and lower over the years. It is the New South Wales Right's code of morality, imposed on a party that previously, I thought, would have stood for a whole range of civil liberties considerations and recognised the paramount importance of telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen Lawrence has been hung, drawn and quartered by her own side of politics. There could be no argument that would explain away why people gave the evidence they did. They were not forced to tell lies, they were not forced to give evidence; they chose to do it because they felt they had no choice but to expose what they obviously regarded as very sordid and unconscionable behaviour. I think that is what will stick in the gullets of all those who have followed this issue, that Carmen Lawrence was prepared to say or do anything to save her own scalp, even though it had the most serious consequences and certainly, ultimately, it has very serious consequences for the political process.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Paul Keating seems to wear as a badge of honour that he can impose his political amorality on the rest of the Labor Party I think is something that they will regret for long after he has departed the scene. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens supported the suspension of standing orders because it is proper that there be a debate on the issues surrounding the Marks royal commission. That did not necessarily mean that we will support the motion. We have listened to the arguments on both sides and have tried to read the royal commission's findings before coming to a final decision. We felt that it was important to debate the motion because it is vital that ministers be accountable to parliament for their actions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter because natural justice demanded that it be debated. We support that suspension because it provides a forum for accountability and debate, whatever its outcome. We did not support the two-hour time limit or the use of a speakers list and informal time limits because that itself violates the principles of natural justice and the democratic rights of each individual senator in this chamber to contribute to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Marks royal commission was a political exercise. It was a misuse of executive power by the Premier, who made opportunistic use of information provided by Dr Lawrence's adversaries or enemies within her own party. Its timing and terms of reference were undeniably politically motivated. It is ironic that it is entitled the `Royal Commission into the Use of Executive Power'. Interestingly, the very first conclusion is that there was no relevant use of executive power. The only relevant use may well have been the appointment of the royal commission itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the federal government's plan to use public funds to defend this political attack is a further wrong which does not make a right. There is no precedent for such funding of legal costs. There is no clear legislative authority. As the government has now acknowledged, any attempt to pay the amount without parliamentary approval would be constitutionally invalid. The Greens will be pursuing this issue further when the appropriation bill comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the process has been inappropriate, it is not to say that there are no questions to be answered over the Easton affair. In fact, there are serious questions here. The very fact that the government has accused the royal commission's terms of reference as targeting Carmen Lawrence begs the question that it does not mention her at all and, if she had not been involved in these matters, she would not or could not have been targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very serious findings within this report, including internal contradictions in Dr Lawrence's own testimony and the weight of evidence contradicting her version which requires its disbelief.

A vision of new politics has been variously described as naive, idealistic, impractical, politically inept and irrelevant. However, this belies the growing community understanding and support for a new politics; for a change to the corrupt cronyism of our current political system. Politics in this country is a ship on which there is constant infighting between competing captains and their crew. What both sides have failed to notice is that in the process the ship has lost its moral rudder.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The document that has been tabled is the subject of a return to order which was passed by the Senate today. I thank the minister for his additional response and for having the report into the allegations relating to the joint state-federal investigation into the alleged unsafe acts aboard the BHPP&mdash;that is, BHP Petroleum&mdash;FPSO <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I must reiterate that neither Mr Visscher nor myself are engaged in a witch-hunt on this issue, but both of us are keen to see that the truth is uncovered and, if there are attempts to cover up the truth, to determine why such a cover-up is taking place. The fact is that, if Mr Visscher's claims are true, there will have been a breach under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and that breach should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly perhaps, my concern relates to the sort of culture that such an attempt at a cover-up is creating in a large company such as BHP. We are all well aware of the many problems that have become obvious in the many BHP operations around the world, and many of these were raised at the BHP annual general meeting which was recently held in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my contention that one of the reasons for these environmental problems is that a corporate culture has developed that encourages short cuts and cost cutting at the expense of the environment and the social obligations to the communities in which they operate. The pressure that I understand has been brought to bear on some employees on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> to hold the company line is not conducive to the encouragement of a culture that values protection of the environment, occupational safety and social and community obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, and perhaps of more concern, especially in relation to the debate we have just had, there is the fact that if Mr Visscher's claims are found to be correct both the federal and state governments are guilty of complicity in a cover-up of the very serious allegations in relation to the incident on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> on 29 May 1994. It is these governments and their departments which are responsible for ensuring proper standards are adhered to in the petroleum industry and that the interests of the workers in that industry and the environments in which they operate are protected from any disaster. If the culture of cover-up extends to the government agencies responsible for this monitoring, there is very serious cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to turn to the report that has just been tabled. In the comments under allegation No. 3, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the purge pipe were assembled as described by Mr Visscher the joint State/Federal investigating team would agree with these conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA>It says that there would have been the potential for a sufficient electrostatic charge to cause sparks. The report then goes on to refer to some crucial evidence to support the report's contention that the purge pipes were correctly installed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the crucial nature of that evidence, I therefore ask the minister to table the photographs taken during the Mark II investigation in September 1994, the BHP freight manifest GV0025 relating to the delivery of the purge pipe and joining pieces on 5 May 1994, the statement by Mr F. Jioni indicating that the flexible pipe was joined by sleeves and the comment by Mr J. Patrick in his fax dated 8 September 1995 indicating that BHP Petroleum believed that the purge pipe work was connected using the internal metallic conductors and externally with tape. I will provide these requests to the minister if he does not have a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because these are extremely important. I thank the Senate for its indulgence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in some of the countries dominated by fairly conservative or right wing governments, those rights to be represented by unions and the right to bargain collectively are a part of their system. I think it would be a grave backward step if this country were ever to accept the sort of philosophy that CRA is promoting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation does not arise from any failure or flaw in the Industrial Relations Act or the government's industrial relations policy. The government stands by those policies and the legislative framework. The objects of the Industrial Relations Act do provide for the encouragement and facilitation of the making of agreements between the parties involved in industrial relations, but it is fundamental to the government's approach that agreements are reached collectively. Collective bargaining is central to and at the foundation of Labor's approach to effective industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act was not intended, nor was it designed, to facilitate or encourage individual contracts. That approach is represented by the WA state government's approach and its Workplace Agreements Act. But the individual workplace agreements used at Weipa are not the agreements that are anticipated by the federal legislation. The workers at Weipa are covered by a minimum rates award, and the payments that the company has made to those persons going onto contracts could be represented as over-award payments, in a sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Weipa we are seeing discrimination between those workers who will sign contracts and those workers who will not. What the company is doing, in a deliberate strategy to undermine collective bargaining, is making those arrangements for, offering financial inducements to, only those workers who are prepared to sign individual workplace agreements. There is no question that the people who choose not to sign those contracts are being treated unfairly. To say that they have a choice is a nonsense, because the choice is to receive far less in pay and conditions than those who are prepared to sign individual contracts. So the workers are left in a situation of either being discriminated against&mdash;receiving far less than fellow workers doing the same work&mdash;or having to sign the contract. For new employees, there is no bargaining power. Clearly, those new employees sign the contract or they do not get the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA has embarked on a deliberate strategy of using individual contracts to remove its workers from those collective bargaining arrangements encouraged by the act. As I have said, this is not a new strategy; we have seen it in a number of CRA-controlled sites around the country. In a recent press release, Comalco even admitted that it was discriminating against those workers who chose to stay on award conditions. A press release from Mr Terry Palmer, the chief executive, on 13 November said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He acknowledged that the award employees at Weipa had not had an enterprise bargaining pay increase for some time. "We should have addressed the up-dating of pay for award-covered employees earlier," Mr Palmer said.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Differences averaging $7,000 per annum have emerged and these should receive serious attention.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have seen the only sign so far from the company acknowledging that there is a real problem in the way that it has used individual contracts to discriminate against those who chose to stay on the award system, or the collective bargaining enterprise agreement, and who are now being seriously discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer made reference to the government's position regarding the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is quite clear that the government maintains its position that the place to resolve this dispute is in the Industrial Relations Commission. The government has always held this view and will continue to argue that the parties should seek to use the good offices of the Industrial Relations Commission to resolve their differences and settle the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not support the widening of the dispute. Obviously we are very concerned about the implications for the economy of any widening of the dispute at Weipa. We understand the frustration of the union movement over CRA's pursuits of its objectives. On a personal note, I am very surprised that the ACTU has not earlier sought to take on more seriously CRA's attack on collective bargaining rights at the various sites. I know that a lot of the people I have associated with in Western Australia have the view that perhaps this issue should have been tackled earlier. The government does not support the widening of the dispute and is concerned at the prospect of extensive industrial action affecting parties which are not associated with the actions taken by CRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an unfortunate situation we find ourselves in, but it is of CRA's making. It is seeking, as it has at other work sites, to buy out trade unionism to ensure that there is no role for trade unions or for collective bargaining among its employees. I would argue that that is clearly against the whole intention of the Industrial Relations Act. It is against the whole history of industrial relations practice in this country for over 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it is seeking to do is to take us back to contract law, the sort of situation that we saw in the late 19th century and the situation that this parliament and all other state parliaments sought to overcome. Those parliaments recognised the unequal bargaining power of a single employee dealing with his employer and recognised the role of collective bodies, including those of employers and employees. For years the industrial relations system in this country, at both federal and state levels, has sought to encourage those associations and the collective process in terms of settling disputes and arranging working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have sought to talk about the Liberal Party's IR agenda in this dispute is that it is part of the wider debate that is going on in this country about industrial relations. We had a similar debate when during the last sitting the Liberal Party were very keen to talk about the second wave legislation in Western Australia. I note no such enthusiasm since they capitulated on that issue. Graham Keirath, the state minister, has not been very keen to talk about it at all for a few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an example of where the Liberal Party and Labor Party stand in industrial relations. The Labor Party does support collective bargaining, it does support rights for workers in seeking to collectively be represented and it does support the role of unions in society. What we see from the Liberal Party is a continuing attack on the role of trade unions and the continued rejection of workers rights to collective bargain. These attacks go to the whole basis of Australian society and the rights that we have traditionally recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some more general comments about this whole question of individual contracts versus collective bargaining because we have had a lot of experience in Western Australia with individual contracts, particularly since the Workplace Agreements Act was introduced in that state. We have a situation where the sort of thing that CRA is attempting to do in Queensland is protected and institutionalised in Western Australia under that Workplace Agreements Act. We have very clear examples of what it means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, people need to understand that these individual contracts can be used in two ways: firstly, they can be used by companies such as CRA to buy out trade unionism. They will essentially say, `We want trade unions out of the system. We don't want collective bargaining. We want to be able to deal with employees on a one-to-one basis and set the conditions. We will offer them a financial inducement to get them out of the union and out of the award system.' We have seen CRA offer quite large inducements on some occasions at a number of sites. At Weipa the company admitted to a $7,000 difference between those who work on a contract and those who work on the collective agreement. They buy out the union effectively by buying out the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say that there is a choice, but the workers only choice is one of working for less and receiving fewer conditions. They also risk being discriminated against by the company for failing to sign the contract. If they are seeking employment, they may not be capable of being employed. So it is not right to say that there is choice. Clearly, when offered superior contracts, workers tend to accept them and they cannot be criticised for that. It is obviously very difficult for unions to try to work against this if a company is prepared to pay any price to put people onto contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between what is occurring in Queensland and Western Australia in the federal or state systems is that at least in the federal system there is the no-disadvantage test and there is the protection of the award system. None of those protections apply in Western Australia under the state legislation, so there is no test to ensure that workers are not disadvantaged by those contracts. I concede from all I have heard about Weipa that the contracts are superior to the award conditions. That is what occurred at Hamersley in Western Australia as well. The company was prepared to buy out trade unions. They were prepared to buy the loyalty of workers and remove them from the collective process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be understood is what happens to workers who have no collective bargaining rights and have no unions when the company comes to renegotiate contracts. We have already seen examples in Western Australia of workers on mining sites being forced to renegotiate their contracts when times have become tougher, when they are non-unionised and when they do not have any ability to collectively bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of this debate in Western Australia is what is happening to those employment areas where workers are not highly paid, where they are not highly skilled and where there is a shortage of labour. The other side of the coin is what is happening to workers in areas where people are looking for work in low paid and largely unskilled areas of the work force. Those areas are traditionally dominated by women and young workers. We are seeing the `sign on or no job' syndrome and the individual contract is very different. It is not one like at Weipa. The individual contract is typically one that makes the workers casuals and ensures that there is no overtime, no penalty rates and no annual leave. That is the other side of the coin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one side you have companies with a lot of money prepared to pay the price to get rid of unions from their companies. The other side of the coin, occurring in Western Australia under the Workplace Agreements Act, is where they say, `You have no bargaining power. You are low paid anyway. We can exploit you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have done in this place already, and am prepared to do further, is give examples of those contracts, examples of what is occurring in Western Australia, where workers have no collective bargaining power and the role of unions is restricted under the Workplace Agreements Act. Those people who are weak are getting ripped off completely. They are being put on to contracts to say that they will work any hours, they will not be entitled to annual leave, they will not be entitled to penalty payments and they will not be entitled to overtime. </PARA>

That is not actually doing anybody any good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go any further, I might say that the question I asked in question time today was asked with the intention of finding out whether the government was actually interested in doing something about it. You might recall that I asked the minister to not regurgitate the debate about who started it and to try not to blame the unions, the contract workers or the company. I asked the minister to tell the ordinary Australians who might have to pay for this dispute what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was actually going to do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer that I got was that he was very interested and that he was trying to conduct meetings and to facilitate a resolution. I was very pleased to hear that, because it was the first time that I had seen any evidence that anybody&mdash;whether it be the unions or the company&mdash;wanted to resolve it. I have subsequently found out that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has made certain decisions, only recently, about jurisdictional issues which clear the way for further hearings regarding the Weipa dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, to me, is what it is all about: to see a situation where both sides can have the opportunity&mdash;and they do, now that the Industrial Relations Commission has cleared the way&mdash;to seek a resolution through negotiation in that forum, which is the most appropriate one. This chamber is not the most appropriate forum. We just have repetition, trotting out the repetitive rhetoric and continually attempting to score political points&mdash;notching up a motion here and a motion there. The best thing we can do in this chamber is to support a process of resolution. Rather than emphasising the differences, entrenching the ideological differences and chucking hand grenades across those trenches, we would be serving Australia best if we supported the negotiation which is now possible in the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Commission is the correct forum, not here.

Surely they pay us to come here to resolve these matters rather than to create them and emphasise them to serve our own political needs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I make is that the dispute at Weipa is all about the abuse of union power and the government's failure to utter a word of condemnation of the illegal actions that the ACTU and several unions have perpetrated. The company, Comalco, has acted totally lawfully and has followed all the legal provisions of the Keating government's own industrial relations act&mdash;all the steps proposed in the legislation for the conduct of enterprise bargaining. The overwhelming majority of the work force have welcomed the company's initiatives and signed individual contracts, which have resulted in more money for them and greater efficiency for the company&mdash;in other words, a classic win-win situation, which is what enterprise bargaining is, and should be, all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, out of a work force of around 700, no less than 635 employees have taken this course of action&mdash;signing the individual contract agreements&mdash;and only 71 have not. The ACTU and the other union bosses have objected violently. Why? For one reason only, and that is that they see this as a weakening of the power of a few elite union officials over the rank and file workers, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of these workers have said to their unions that they and their families are more than happy with what the company has done and with what the parent company, CRA, has been progressively moving towards at its various operations over the past three years, with very successful results for both the company and its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let no-one be fooled about this matter. This dispute is not about terms and conditions of employment, unless you are saying that somehow or other we should be objecting to a deal which improves the terms and conditions of employment. Rather, it is about the naked overweening ambitions of a small bunch of union leaders and officials who have become drunk with power over many years, who are not prepared to face up to the changes that are going on around them and who are not prepared to be part of those changes because they fear their power will be eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty, made this absolutely crystal clear last Monday in his address to the maritime unions, during which time he rabbleroused them to undertake a five-day national stoppage. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing an urgency motion introduced by the opposition. I believe there is an urgency to tell the real story about industrial relations in this country. First of all, let us go back to the early 1980s when Mr Viner was a minister in the Fraser government. He addressed a meeting at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He outlined a plan to introduce a United States style industrial relations into this country. The United States system, under the slogan of `enterprise agreement', allows the might of capital to destroy trade unions and to use employers' central power and their tremendous resources to deny workers, particularly in isolated sites, the intelligence, the resources and the support of trade unions to represent them.</PARA></TALK.START>

The number of individual disputes was at record levels under the Fraser government. Senator Parer said he was embarrassed about our name at various times. We have to assess that Mr Fraser was a moderate when we look at the experience of Dr Hewson and Mr Howard as opposition leaders. The current Liberal Party supports every feral employer's attempt to smash the trade unions and destroy the system of conciliation and arbitration as we know it today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rather than the wording in this matter of urgency, I think that Minister Brereton's comments on page 1 of this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> more accurately reflect the situation, contrary to the comments by Senator Abetz.

<PARA>Yesterday, Senator O'Chee attempted to describe this dispute as an ACTU beat-up. He sought to explain away the dispute and said there was very little separating workers and management. The difference was, he said, simply a question of representation in negotiations. He is right, but it is no small issue. The key issues are representation and discrimination; that is, choose collective representation and miss out on over-awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton was also correct in emphasising this morning that this dispute exists despite the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which the government continues to stand by, and despite the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;a principal object of which is helping to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of, amongst other things, political opinion. Collective representation is a political opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than relying on Senator O'Chee's opinion expressed yesterday regarding the views of workers and shop stewards, I will draw upon a statement by a striking worker at Weipa&mdash;a statement amongst a few I should outline.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A choice to be discriminated against. On a previous occasion when I participated in a debate on industrial relations, Senator Crane, who I understand will speak next, implied that the federal government was responsible for low minimum wage rates in Queensland. Let me reinforce our argument in this matter by adding to my comments on that previous occasion. There are cases where minimum rates in Queensland are lower than they should be, but the federal Industrial Relations Commission has acted to rectify such inequities on application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, my first arbitrated case in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, along with the minimum rates adjustment process, lifted the minimum rate for Queensland vehicles sales people from $324.60 to over $400 per week&mdash;an increase of over $80 per week. This occurred under the federal commission's wage fixing principles of the time, supported by the federal government, to remove anomalies and inequities. Once again, this emphasises that those opposite continue to run superficial arguments, where, upon closer examination, it is revealed that the circumstances prevail despite rather than because of federal government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer, in his opening comments in this debate, implied that this matter had nothing to do with federal coalition policy, but that policy encourages individual contracts. As Minister Brereton has pointed out, the act was not intended or designed to facilitate individual contracts. Contrary to the comments of both Senator Short and Senator Abetz, individual contracts are not synonymous with enterprise bargaining. You cannot say this can be achieved under individual contracts and imply it is a benefit of enterprise bargaining.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to correct something that Senator Jacinta Collins mentioned in her contribution to this debate. I never implied or suggested that the state minimum wage in Queensland was the responsibility of the federal government. I said that it was the responsibility of the Goss government, which is the state Labor government. I would just like to put that correction on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironical that we on this side of the chamber are supporting what, logically, one would have thought the government itself would have supported: that is, its own Industrial Relations Act and what has occurred under that. Secondly, I would have thought the government would have supported the institution that it has supported very strongly for as long as I can remember in industrial relations&mdash;that is, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;and its findings. In both instances, the government is failing to do so. I think that is really the crux of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of what has occurred with the CRA operations, it has gone further in a legal sense than I initially thought it would. One has to question why at this particular time, after the Industrial Relations Reform Act has been in operation since December 1993, some 11,000 employees out of 16,000 from the CRA groups&mdash;from Gladstone, Bell Bay, Hamersley and elsewhere&mdash;have signed individual workplace contracts. There has not been a word out of this government, not a word from the ACTU and not a whimper from anyone else. Jennie George stands up on the steps of the Western Australian parliament and says, `We are going to take industry by industry down,' or words to that effect. We now find that after 1,635 employees at Weipa have signed individual contracts 74 have not done so, and all of a sudden it is the big No. 1 issue. What has occurred proves absolutely and categorically that this is a political exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from the other side of the chamber consistently that their minimum standard in terms of negotiations from awards into certified agreements or enterprise agreements is a no disadvantage test. They are now saying, because individuals at Weipa have negotiated deals for themselves with significant differences in flexibilities which make them significantly better off, that the no disadvantage test is no longer good enough. Those other people have to have the same remuneration, regardless of what comes out of the agreement, as what those individuals have been able to negotiate. That is a classic double standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know and the government knows that the no disadvantage test protects that particular position. Similarly, Senator Chris Evans knew very well when he made certain claims today regarding minimum conditions and holiday pay in Western Australia that he is absolutely and totally wrong. Because of the time limitations, I will deal with that issue at another time by tabling the minimum conditions which exist in Western Australia. It is absolutely, totally unbelievable and ironical that we have the government arguing against people in the workplace being able to get better conditions, more flexibility, more holiday pay, more leave, different arrangements for taking their leave and better wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always spoken out strongly in support of the right of workers to collectively bargain. This is fundamental to any choice or leverage for workers in negotiations with management. My criticism of government has been that it has attempted to pursue labour reform which undermines collective bargaining as part of its New Right agenda while trying to care about workers. Its compromise solutions obviously have not and do not work.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is, and always has been, that reduction of the scope of collective bargaining&mdash;making unions smaller, removing the base of collective action by forcing `open shops' and making them less able to make links across industries&mdash;ultimately works against workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some businesses have cooperative and democratic approaches to labour. Some businesses, however, see a return to the labour relations of the 1800s as an ideal to be sought. Workers could come cap in hand to bosses in hope of work and wages would let them put a few crusts on the family table. Ideally, a police force and army, backed by law and government, would put down workers in the event of the economic club rendering them numb enough or angry enough to resist. These businesses often use the fact that workers in Vietnam, China and Indonesia already live and work under such conditions to force similar conditions on the workers in developed countries in the name of `international competitiveness'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individual contracts are the cutting edge of the current push. The idea of individual contract is a legal embodiment of the isolated worker, cap in hand. CRA is pushing this line hard. It is using the vulnerability of workers by buying the less scrupulous, or more desperate, as essentially scabs to try to eliminate unions. This is union busting plain and simple and there is no guarantee that individual contract workers will continue to get paid significantly higher than union wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, or should be, quite illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they belong to a union, and of course that is exactly what the CRA is doing in offering workers tens of thousands of dollars more per year if they refuse to belong to a union or are refusing jobs to union members. That is what the individual contracts are designed for, to allow this sort of discrimination and other sorts of discrimination. Such contracts, however written, must violate no discrimination rules, and certainly the principle that similar work should attract similar wages and conditions. If workers performing similar work can have massive wage differences based on union status, they could equally be discriminated against individually on sexual or racial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mask used by industry is that of choice. But the option of non-union workplaces, especially in remote areas, means management can use its power to eliminate the option of union workplaces. Choice applied to workers is driven by necessity. Most individuals have little economic power. Given the choice between hunger and exploitation, most people choose exploitation. Given the choice between hunger and abandoning unions, many workers would give up their power. Look around internationally and you will see the truth of this. If you think hunger is an extreme statement of unemployment, I remind the Senate that the coalition has suggested limiting unemployment benefits to a few weeks or months. The labour market is a biased market. This gives management a lot of power to determine the conditions of sale. This is the basis of the push for so-called choice. It is not freedom; it is coercion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ANL sale is of course a matter of great embarrassment to the government. It is something that the government planned to do and then the government planned not to do. In fact, the government planned not to do it because the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, said ANL could not be sold. What we see at the moment is a situation where the government does not know really whether it is Arthur or Martha. Certainly in terms of privatisation the government does not have the slightest clue what is on its agenda. That is the simple nub of the matter.

We are going to have a larger float than we anticipated; we are going to have another two tranches.' Labor cannot be relied upon to make its promises stick in privatisations of any business enterprises. I think that is the lesson that has to be learnt from this whole experience. </PARA>

They both hate the idea of the people owning anything through government aside from submarines or monuments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has the gall to promote the idea of an Australian republic, citing national sovereignty as the rationale, at the same time as it donates our economic sovereignty to the international money market. It worships at the altar of free trade, which purports to promote competition but in fact delivers entire industries to a handful of giant international oligopolies. There are fewer, not more, players in world shipping, with a collection of smaller operators at the margin who survive by undercutting operational and safety standards. Most of the major operators also have second-string operations which utilise flag of convenience ships and poorly paid crews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber rejected the notion of a comprehensive liability regime to encourage a better standard of shipping. Who are we protecting? Before ANL&mdash;one of the remnants of Australian industry still publicly owned&mdash;gets sold, like Qantas, let us look at what we have done here. Ideology aside, the major argument for selling ANL is that it is a commercial disaster. Last year, just in case there is any doubt, the board was sacked and replaced by a board that would ensure that ANL showed up as a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last annual report is revealing. It talks about a mandate from government, which apparently was that ANL should be prepared for sale. I remember that when the board was put in place it was a clear wish of the government to sell ANL, and it was delayed. My understanding was that technically, on the surface, the new board was to try to manage ANL to see whether it needed to be sold. When the board was announced, it was widely perceived as a con&mdash;a board which would beat up the books and assure that no-one would want to keep ANL; not a board that had any intention of managing ANL as a shipping line, since it had not had any expertise in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last committee hearing it was raised and noted that the cumulative losses were tripled by the board, primarily through provisions for restructuring. Where all earlier provisions for restructuring were efforts to restructure to make the enterprise more profitable, the provisions by the new board seemed to be restructuring to allow an easier sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When queried as to what this debt was about&mdash;this restructuring which seemed to strip over $100 million from the book value of the company&mdash;the explanation was that businesses can, under ordinary circumstances, hide debt and not include it in accounts. But when they are sold they should be included in the accounts. I do not know whether any other enterprise that had successfully covered up debt under normal business practice would drastically increase the debt on the books as an enticement to buyers, but it seems to me to raise some serious questions about accountability of government business enterprises and the general practice of government and accountability in relation to government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us back to the management of the company by the Commonwealth. One of the central problems appears to have been a high level of indebtedness. ANL was allowed to have a high debt burden; hence a very high component of costs went to servicing loans. I have heard a number of stories from people in ANL about government promises of capitalisation, which led to commitments to overhaul or purchase ships. When the capital failed to materialise, ANL, and some shipbuilders expecting payment, I have heard, were left in an untenable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appears to be part of the problem&mdash;government, in relation to government business enterprises, seems to corporatise them in the belief that it will automatically make them profitable and try to operate them as though they were magic milch cows, extracting profits, refusing to commit capital and forcing them to unsustainable levels of debt. The shipping industry as a whole has generally suffered economically in the last several years. It is always important when businesses operate on the margins to reduce debt levels wherever possible. This was not done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some may claim that this would simply transfer debt to the state, but I have argued on a number of occasions that a major problem of government is a shortfall of revenue. It is not addressed by shifting debt to government business  enterprises or allowing government business enterprises to build up unsustainable debt levels in order to keep the book debt of the Commonwealth hidden. Nor, incidentally, is it addressed by selling assets and then leasing them back&mdash;something that is generally financially stupid, even in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, why can the Commonwealth not run a shipping line as easily as P&amp;O can? I do not think there is actually any reason. There is some mad belief that governments are inherently unable to participate in industry, although they are supposed to be able to operate national economies just fine. The contradiction in this attitude becomes very clear when such an argument is used to privatise something like a power company and the wonderful competitive bidder that is brought in is a foreign government government business enterprise. Obviously the only thing that stops a government business enterprise from being fully competitive is that it does not bid for businesses in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are there any other underlying reasons that ANL should not be successful, aside from owner hostility, an attitude towards company finances typical of Bond or Elliott and an ideological belief that what is occurring is heresy?

One of the intentions of the government in creating award superannuation was to ensure that that did not occur. That is why many award superannuation policies contain provisions for life insurance as well because, obviously, it is a concern to every worker that they could die before what we consider to be the normal time and their widow or children would be left without anybody to provide for them. I think it is a laudable intention that such policies do have life insurance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to lay before the Senate tonight is a case where a fund is seeking to deny those life insurance benefits to the next of kin of a member of one of those funds who died an untimely death. I think everybody should be shocked to hear the case of the late Bryce Robert Rodgers, who was a member of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and was also a member of the Building Union Superannuation Scheme, Queensland, called BUSSQ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of Mr Rodgers's case are simply this: Mr Rodgers started work with a company in Queensland called Marlin Consultants Pty Ltd on 14 March 1995. He was a member of the Building Union Superannuation Scheme and his national membership number was 2408028. Unfortunately, Mr Rodgers was killed in a car accident on 1 April this year, about two weeks after having joined the scheme. On 14 March his contribution was forwarded by his employer to Jacques Martin Industry, which is the administrator of the fund, together with the premium paid up from March. The only problem was that the form was not signed by Mr Rodgers. The employer, in remitting the form, did not get Mr Rodgers to sign it. Notwithstanding that, the fund accepted Mr Rodgers as a member. It accepted the money, made no attempt to return the money and made no complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rodgers was then, unfortunately, killed in a car accident. Since that period Mr Rodgers's de facto and their three children have been without support. They have tried, without success, to have their entitlements under the life insurance component of that scheme paid to them. Time after time they were told either that Mr Rodgers was not a member of the fund or that the matter was still being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now seen a period of some six or seven months elapse and it is thoroughly unacceptable that this woman and her children should be in this situation. There is a young family that needs the benefits that were supposed to be provided under this superannuation scheme. I think the manner in which Mr Rodgers's de facto has been treated by Jacques Martin is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable that they are continually putting off&mdash;day after day, week after week. I spoke to Mr Rodgers's mother a couple of weeks ago and she was absolutely distraught, as well she might be. I find it disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point is this: Mr Rodgers had an equitable interest in that fund. The fact that he had not signed a form was not his fault. The fund had accepted his money and had accepted him for membership. Of course, he and his de facto were entitled to all of the benefits of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, the matter is one which the trustees will have to decide upon. Otherwise, it will have to go to court. But I would hope that these people would recognise that there is an equitable interest. I do not believe that Mr Rodgers's de facto should be forced to go to court to fight for these things. I would have thought that decency and good commercial judgment on the part of the administrator would mean that they would accept their obligation and ensure that the widow is paid out. I do not think it is acceptable at all that this situation should continue and I would think that anybody who has any dealings with these people would be disgusted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The horticultural industry, as Senator Collins well knows, is going through a very tough time at the moment. That is as a result, in part, of the infestation of papaya fruit fly. I think it is appropriate to take this opportunity to outline to the Senate the sorts of concerns growers in Far North Queensland have had as a result of the infestation. We discussed some of the matters in the Senate estimates committee the other night, but we did not discuss all of them and I think it is not inappropriate to raise the matters here again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter is that, as a result of this infestation, markets which were previously open to growers have become closed. The markets are closed to all growers at the moment, irrespective of whether they are in the infested area or not. I think particularly of the market for mangoes in Japan, which was closed by Japanese authorities as a result of the infestation. It is not only growers on the Atherton Tableland that have been affected; growers further south, in Bowen and elsewhere, have also found that the market has been closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said at the estimates committee hearing the other night&mdash;I have no reason to not take him at his word&mdash;that efforts are being made to ensure that this situation can be rectified and that we can get some expedient entry into Japan again for our product. What concerns me is that it may not happen this season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to do with the way in which mangoes are grown. You have different varieties and some come off earlier and some come off later. Of course, it is for our benefit that that happens. Consumers get the benefit of a longer season and the growers get the opportunity to sell into a market for a longer period of time with less competition amongst themselves and, therefore, better prices. The problem is that the late varieties have not had certification for vapour heat treatment protocols, as has the earlier variety of Kensington Pride. The consequence is going to be that if we get acceptance into the Japanese market it may be only the late mangoes that could possibly be exported and, of course, they are not eligible for export because there is no protocol in place for the vapour heat treatment of those mangoes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other problems relates to other fruit and vegetable growers on the Atherton Tableland and the problems they suffered. For example, when the infestation was first discovered, the pumpkins were coming off. The growers of pumpkins found that they had a grave problem in so much as other states were refusing to accept the pumpkin. There were controls placed on the movement of those pumpkins out of the Atherton Tableland to markets further south because there was a concern that the pumpkins could be a possible vector for the movement of papaya fruit fly. I understand that that is not possibly the case, but I understand that in the interim there has been enormous loss suffered by growers. Basically, the benefits of the season for those people have been lost altogether. I think that is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also sad is that the ongoing protocols are such that much of the fruit currently has to be moved in refrigerated wagons. Refrigerated movement is much more expensive than other types of movement. The problem relates to the refrigeration of the fruit after it has been chemically treated. If this situation occurs, there is major loss in terms of profitability because the higher transport cost comes out of the money that the grower receives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a matter that must be urgently rectified. The joint working committee of state departments and the federal department must rectify this situation as soon as possible. Protocols must be put in place so that growers can get their crops to market as quickly as possible. If that happens, we can minimise some of the damage that is being suffered at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a major disaster for Far North Queensland growers and I hope that every effort is made by all concerned to ensure that the damage, the loss and the injury is limited as far as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to quickly respond to what Senator O'Chee has had to say. As Senator O'Chee has mentioned, there has been a great deal of effort by officers of my department and the Queensland Department of Primary Industry to deal with the problem on the ground in respect of eradication and also to ensure that the difficulty for the markets is as short-lived as possible. The immediate effort that is going into that is that areas of freedom are being established in other cropping areas by laying out, on grid patterns, traps that will satisfy our trading partners that those particular areas are free of this pest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by quickly referring to the concern that Senator O'Chee has raised in respect of the late varieties of mangoes other than Kensington Pride. I simply want to confirm what I told Senator O'Chee in the estimates committee hearing. Senator O'Chee drew my attention to correspondence which had been sent to him&mdash;and, as I understand it, has subsequently been forwarded to me&mdash;by growers in the area asking for consideration to be given to the research required for establishing protocols with the late varieties of mangoes other than Kensington Pride. I stress that this submission was made not in respect of the papaya fruit fly but in respect of treatment that is already required in Queensland for the endemic Queensland fruit fly, which was done only in respect of Kensington Pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position that Senator O'Chee put to me at the estimates committee hearing, which I said I considered was sensible, was that, in respect of the protocols that now have to be established to satisfy Japan and other trading partners, the protocols required for dealing with the endemic Queensland fruit fly that are already in place will also deal with the papaya fruit fly and, sensibly, should also involve the later varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the Senate estimates hearing&mdash;and I am happy to repeat it here&mdash;that suggestion makes sense to me. Not being a technical expert and not having yet been able to get a response from the technical experts, as I said in the estimates hearing, the only caveat I wish to put on that is if there is a massive technical problem that would prevent it. If there is not, I think it makes enormous sense for that to be done so that the protocols for all of these varieties of mangoes&mdash;both early and late&mdash;can be developed at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave the Senate estimates committee a commitment, which I repeat here in response to Senator O'Chee, that, as far as I am concerned as minister, I will ensure that that is done. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that everybody is ageing gracefully. The community is ageing very rapidly because, quite simply, people are living longer and, hopefully, people are living much more fulfilling lives as well. One of the difficulties is that there are some people who, for various reasons, find themselves incapable of living in their own home. As a consequence, more and more people are finding themselves in nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the nursing home industry has grown up as a consequence of this occurrence. People can make judgments as to whether it is good or bad that larger numbers of elderly people are now living in nursing homes. There are people who would say, `This is dreadful. It's a demise of society. Children are no longer paying attention to the best interests of their parents.' But, at the same time, it is interesting to note that people in traditional communities which have generally looked after their parents are also moving into nursing homes. For example, many of our ethnic communities are setting up their own ethnic community nursing homes. It is probably not an indication that society is falling apart; rather, it is an indication that there are pressures on families that make it more difficult for some people to live with their children. Also, some of the needs of these elderly people are such that they cannot be cared for at home. Of course, when people live longer, they are more likely to have health complications which make it necessary for them to have some proper care. That is why people are going into nursing homes and hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this industry has grown up and it is being advertised very heavily. So it is important that proper standards do exist for people who find themselves in nursing homes. How one does that is another matter. Obviously, the published nursing home and hostel standards monitoring statements are produced by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). One of the things that we should always remember is that the nursing home or hostel environment should be as human as possible. We do not want a situation where people find themselves in these institutions and feel that they are not a fully valued member of society. That creates a situation of despondency, a situation of despair. It is something that we can really do without. It is also a dreadful way for people to live. That is something that has to be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that needs to be taken into consideration is that we need to create opportunities for people to get care in some other way and avoid going into nursing homes. For example, we need to be much more creative in our responses to the provision of health services to elderly people. At the moment, there is very little difference for people who need ongoing medical care between going to a doctor and going into a nursing home. It is increasingly difficult to get home nurses. One of the suggestions that was made to me recently when I was on the Tweed Coast was that we could set up a sort of one-stop shop where people could come and get medical care&mdash;it may not be the sort of medical care for which one would require a doctor; it may be the sort of medical care that could be provided by a registered nurse&mdash;and advice from a nutritionist and so on. It would offer people an opportunity to get all of those services. It would not have to be a fully functioning centre. It could operate for only part of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of creative solutions which offer people who are currently going into nursing homes because they need a little bit more care because they cannot afford to go to the doctor all the time a viable alternative to a nursing home. Whatever it is, the standard of care that we provide for elderly people in our community must be of the very highest standard possible. We need to be as flexible as possible in the sorts of solutions that we provide to these people so that they have dignified and fulfilling lives. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of some concern to me that the Australian Workers Union, and in particular Mr Ludwig, are able to spend amounts of money on legal fees and internal battles but do not have, apparently, any money to look after their members when their members' interests are not only at risk but also have been severely attacked by unreasonable employers. The unreasonable employer I have in mind is a well-known piggery and the men involved are people who were dismissed. I have to say they were dismissed after the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, ceased being a half-owner of the piggery. They were dismissed in June and his interest was acquired by Indonesian interests in March. These men were wrongfully dismissed after they protested that for the previous two years they had been paid less than the award rates by a piggery half-owned by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter from one of these men, who, I must say, I did help when they came to see me as a result of approaching the Tamworth office of one of my colleagues. It is quite a sad story because these people who were wrongly dismissed&mdash;and there is no doubt about that&mdash;in June 1994 are still to receive any recompense. In fact, one of them is still out of work and receiving unemployment benefit. It is very difficult in a country town, particularly after a rural recession, to get jobs. I would like to read bits of the letter written by Mr Ken Purdue of Moonbi that was sent to a few people. It goes like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to point out that we are not after a quick buck. We three blokes have put twenty-two years between us into our jobs, we did our jobs well and cared for the livestock we looked after, one of us was a leading hand.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, these are the people who got sacked because they complained about getting underaward wages while employed by the Prime Minister's half-owned piggery. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears our big blunder was that we had the audacity to ask about the under payment of wages which had been occurring for years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this is that we three were sacked and I have listed the sequence of events that have occurred since.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30th June, 1994, after five years of employment with the Brown &amp; Hatton Group Piggery, which was half owned by Mr. Paul Keating (the Prime Minister) and half by Mr. Al Constantinidis, I and two other employees were sacked on the spot with no money or entitlements being paid to us until a week later.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that Mr Al Constantinidis was Mr Keating's partner and was the person through whom Mr Keating disposed of his half-interest to Indonesian interests. I must say that Mr Constantinidis is subject to summonses at present from the Australian Securities Commission and has received numerous penalties for failing to meet the requirements of the Corporations Law, but he was Mr Keating's partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating trusted him enough and he had enough confidence in him to have Mr Constantinidis look after Mr Keating's interest entirely. Whenever I raised problems about the improper behaviour of Mr Constantinidis, Mr Keating consistently said that he had nothing to do with running the companies. In other words, he was quite content to have his companies run by a man who was continually breaching the law. At no stage has Mr Keating ever publicly stated that he wanted to dissociate himself from the activities of this man. He has been repeatedly challenged to do so in this chamber and he has never done so. Mr Purdue goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stated above simply because we had made enquiries about under-award payments to the Dept. of Industrial Relations. A few weeks later we found out our superannuation contributions had gone missing on the day of our dismissal. We contacted the union, the A.W.U.F.I.M.E., who said we were unlawfully dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To fight our case the union hired McClellands as our solicitors with Greg Keating, the Prime Minister's brother, to be our representative.</PARA>
<PARA>I should interpose that Mr Greg Keating did eventually recognise the potential conflict of interest involved and recommended that another member of the firm look after the men. I might say that the advice they gave was grossly inadequate, massively to the men's disadvantage and quite disgraceful. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the union&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">sent us to the wrong address for conciliation meetings with company and Industrial Relations Court and failed to meet us at places and times they had organised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22nd November, 1995, a Conciliation Meeting with the Union, Al Constantinidis, the Conciliation Commissioner and us was held. The union advised us to accept a pittance of our entitlements e.g. five weeks pay.</PARA>
<PARA>The required amount for wrongful dismissal, if it is established, is up to 26 weeks pay. The union recommended for a variety of reasons that they take five weeks pay&mdash;one reason of course being that it would cost the union something like $30,000 to pursue the case and the union said that it did not have any money. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9th December . . . I contacted the Commissioner and asked when we would be payed, he told me to back off and leave it alone.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, as I understand it, that was because he said that the company probably would not have any money. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was dissatisfied with proceedings thus far so I reopened the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was because of the treatment we had received up to this time that I decided to contact Senator Michael Baume in the hope he may be able to help, as by now the case was growing out of all proportion. If it was not for the Senator we would still be banging our heads against a brick wall.</PARA>
<PARA>I in fact did introduce these people to a solicitor who I thought may be able to help them on a pro bono basis, because they had no money. In fact that is what happened. As a result of my doing that, in the Senate estimates hearing on 6 November Senator Bolkus accused me of probably being a reason for this matter dragging on and these men getting nothing. When I had asked why this case had dragged on&mdash;I was asking questions in estimates to the Industrial Relations Court, Attorney-General's Department&mdash;Senator Bolkus interrupted, `Because of your involvement.' I am not involved in the case. I simply referred these workers, who had been robbed by the Prime Minister's half-owned piggery company, to a solicitor who has looked after them, as I understand it, on a pro bono basis. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have all the facts and legal papers, court records and affidavits.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have now been fighting for eighteen months for justice and believe we have a right to our day in court. We are just three ordinary Australian blokes and we have discovered that we apparently have no rights when we try to get justice from a BIG COMPANY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has now got to the point where the PRINCIPLE of being declared legally UNJUSTLY DISMISSED is more important than the dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>And they have no dollars. But it is interesting to note that the Australian Workers Union apparently has dollars, because here we have William Ludwig taking action against Stephen Harrison, Christopher Hayes and a whole series of people on 25 October in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. In a statement of claim&mdash;Mr C. A. Sciacca and Associates are the solicitors&mdash;Mr Ludwig says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As at the date of filing this statement of claim no balance sheets for the financial year ended 30 June 1993 or 30 June 1994 have been provided by the Branches of the former FIME to Branch Committees of Management of those branches nor to the National executive of the AWU.</PARA>
<PARA>This union has plenty of money to fight legal battles for itself and to get involved in a whole lot of things but does not, frankly, have the interest or the determination to back workers who are involved in a dispute with the Prime Minister's former piggery company. I believe that is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I want to address tonight relates to a matter I raised in the Senate in the evening of 1 March this year. On that evening I read into the record a letter from Pastor Hasoloan Tambunan at Galang Island in Indonesia. The letter I read into the record was addressed to Deaconess D.E. Fletcher, Administrator, SEAAC Inc., 4 Troks Court, Glen Waverley, Victoria 3150.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without reading all of the letter into the record again, because it is already on the record, the letter essentially asked Deaconess Fletcher and the SEAAC organisation in Melbourne not to send any more letters of sponsorship to people who were screened out of the refugee process at Galang Island in Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I very briefly explained to the Senate on that evening, I had earlier in the year visited for the second time Galang Island in Indonesia and had witnessed the distress that some people on the island had suffered because false hope was being given to individuals on the island&mdash;boat people who had fled Vietnam and Cambodia, who had been screened out as refugees and who were awaiting resettlement or repatriation to their homelands but were refusing to voluntarily return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people on the island who raised this matter with me and with officials who accompanied me from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta were equally upset with the strength of feeling that people had expressed to us during our visit to the island. I undertook at that time that, when I came back to Australia, I would see what I could do to stop the messages of false hope being given to individuals in the camp from people in Australia. I figured that the best way of doing that was to put some facts on the record by reading the letter into the record from the vicar on the island who was expressing his own feelings to the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turned out that the letter that I read into the record was never received by Deaconess Fletcher. When I sent her a copy of my speech it caused her some upset to not have received a letter which ostensibly was addressed to her. I think it was never received because the organisation's address is 4 Tricks Court, Glen Waverley and the pastor's letter was addressed to `4 Troks Court'. It never reached her, and it would appear that the SEAAC organisation, Deaconess Fletcher, others involved in the organisation in Melbourne and indeed, and more importantly, the 3,000 or so people on the island were the subject of a great degree of trickery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps another letter that I want to read into the record tonight will explain where that trickery comes from. This is a letter that Deaconess Fletcher has supplied to me. I will not read into the record the names of the people to whom the letter is addressed because I do not have their permission to do so, but it is there for people to see if they want to. If there is any need for clarification afterwards, I will seek the agreement of those people to read their names into the record at a later time. After the salutation the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reply to your letter dated 16th February, and further to our telephone conversation following receipt of same, we would first of all apologise for our slowness in responding to your request for information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been due to circumstances beyond our control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned and saddened at the plight of so many thousands of refugees who have remained in camps for long periods of time. However, the fact is that it is quite beyond the capacity of the South East Asian Assistance Com. to undertake sponsorships for more than we are already committed to help.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This particularly refers to those who are presently at Galang Camp, Indonesia. We have received more than 2,000 letters to date from those seeking sponsorships. The three hundred sponsorships which have been lodged with the Department Immigration are the absolute capacity which we can cope with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">False hope is being given by tricksters within Galang Camp. This is not only causing much heart break among the refugees themselves, but is also causing us to have to cope with such a work load that great strain is being placed upon workers and office staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been advised by an officer of the Department Immigration that further lodgement of any sponsorships from Galang would only jeopardize the possible acceptance of those who we have already named for possible acceptance and resettlement assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We appreciate your readiness to convey this information to contacts at Galang Camp, and hasten to assure you that S.E.A.A.C. has a record second to none, in the program which has been maintained since the beginning of 1976. Many refugees have been successfully resettled, and close friendships have been forged through these years. We have done our best to assist many hundreds who have come under our care as they have come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please be assured of our readiness to be of help in any way possible. However, the present demands are quite unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thankyou for your assistance . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was raised in regard to a letter which was sent to SEAAC from the other organisation, which I have not got permission to name. That letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Deaconess,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently there have been rumours in Galang refugee camp, Indonesia that your organisation is going to sponsor 1000 asylum seekers to be resettled in Australia. There are already people going around in the camp selling application forms and making profits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like to ask you to clarify the matter so we can explain to asylum seekers there in order to stop them from harbouring false hopes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you very much for your help.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that it has now taken until November for me to come into the chamber and read this into the record and perhaps correct the impression that I may have incorrectly given&mdash;the impression that the South-East Asian Assistance Committee was in any way encouraging the trickery, the fraud or the bewilderment of the individuals that I met in Galang in January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for taking so long is that Deaconess Fletcher only last week supplied me with the correspondence that I read into the record. I did offer quite early in the piece to correct any incorrect statements that I had made. I hope that my reading into the record tonight the details of the letters&mdash;the letter to SEAAC in response to the letter from the organisation which I will not name at this point&mdash;will correct any bad impression I gave that Deaconess Fletcher or her organisation had not been doing the right thing on behalf of those unfortunate individuals at Galang Camp in Indonesia. I will forward the proof <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to them tomorrow and, hopefully, that will be the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to divert and say that when I was in Galang Island in January I had hoped that, come December of this year, that camp would be closed down under the terms of the comprehensive plan of action which was agreed to by the major nations involved in the resettlement of Vietnamese boat people. Unfortunately, it does not appear that that will happen. It certainly will not happen from Hong Kong, where many thousands of people vegetate in circumstances that human beings should not be subjected to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that of course is that there is legislation before the parliament in the United States which I most sincerely believe is giving false hope to those people who are living in less than preferable circumstances. They have fled their country, some of them for genuine reasons. Some of them were screened in as refugees and have been resettled in places like Australia. We can be very proud in this country for what we have done for those unfortunate refugees who have had to flee their home country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are others who took advantage of the boats leaving Vietnam who wanted to improve their economic circumstances but unfortunately were not deemed to be refugees and not deemed to be valid for resettlement. They choose to vegetate in camps such as Galang Island. It is unfortunate they choose to do so. It is even more unfortunate that the people in the United States should be encouraging them by seeking to put the legislation through the Congress, which of course will be vetoed at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Mr President, I would like to respond. Mr President, as you are aware, I have been refusing leave on this matter, firstly, because I have been concerned that some aspects of this document are in breach of standing order 193&mdash;but generally it seems that the rulings on that matter have been going against me&mdash;and, secondly, because, although I have accepted the right of Senator Crichton-Browne to defend his position, in this instance his defence is in effect an attack upon some of my colleagues and former colleagues and my party.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LIBERAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA WA DIVISION (INC)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document is meant to be neither exhaustive nor definitive but its purpose is rather to highlight both contemporary and historic facts. In order to argue the following:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.That all the grounds of the State Executive are contrived, concocted and trivial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two grounds are covered by privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.One ground is the product of the malicious leaking of a <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">private conversation by a destructive and disloyal liberal party member to a member of the media whom they knew would be receptive to such mischievous gossip.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One ground is factually incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The motion does not justify expulsion, suspension or censure, but is rather intended to justify a predetermined view of the State President for what ever his motives  that I should be expelled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No such ground has ever been ventured in respect to any member of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, never mind a senior Federal Senator, a past State President and a life member of State Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Executive motion asking me to resign gave no ground, justification or reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was refused a right to attend that State Executive and to be heard. The resignation resolution by the State President to State Executive was based on different grounds to the expulsion motion. No grounds could or did justify the resignation motion. The expulsion motion was moved because quite naturally I would not simply bend to the misinformed, improper and biased call to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Presidents motives in moving the resignation and expulsion motions had nothing to do with the grounds, but were in part, the result of a deal he entered into with a small but threatening group of organisational and parliamentary members. Euphemistically called, on some occasions, "the peace plan".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State President has deliberately ignored the debilitating, disruptive and destructive conduct and comments of a number of party members including senior office bearers and Members of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One ground relates to the improper obtaining of private information and its improper distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect to the restraining order, subsequent to its public disclosure, both the State President and the Premier have condemned its publication and stated frequently it should not and does not impinge upon my role or contribution as a Liberal Senator and both subsequently offered me publicly their full support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Market research shows that the matter has had no impact whatsoever on voter intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The action undertaken in respect to me is a gulf of difference between that of other contemporary Members of Parliament and the historic response to grave conduct by organisational and Parliamentary members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grounds contrived against me bear absolutely no comparison with examples which I have given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process undertaken by State Executive was based on an adversarial nature rather than one of ensuring proper and full opportunities for the matter to dealt with in a fair and conciliatory way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My counsel and myself were invited to attend the State Executive, present our case and to answer a number of questions, but we were not entitled to ask questions, we were not able to rebut assertions made against me and nor were we able to rebut comments made in respect to our submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public and private statements by the State President and other State Executive members prior to the State Executive meeting should have led to the disqualification of those from the hearing. However not withstanding a request from Malcolm McCusker QC that they  disqualify themselves, they refused and participated in the deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. RESTRAINING ORDER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clauses of the State Executive resolution headed RESTRAINING ORDER AND PARTY LEADER are in breach of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which codifies article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688[9].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The immunity of parliamentary proceedings from impeachment or question in courts or other tribunals depends ultimately on article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1688 [9], which is part of the law applying to the Australian Houses by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 9 provided that "the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 16 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987</EMPHASIS> codifies the interpretation of article 9 in its application to the Australian Houses. The section provides that evidence of parliamentary proceedings cannot be used in any court or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">tribunal</EMPHASIS> in any way contrary to article 9 or the section. The prohibited use of evidence of parliamentary proceedings is defined to include any use of those proceedings against any person in a wide sense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Act provides a wide definition of "impeached or questioned", it does not exhaust the meaning of that phrase, and the definition of "tribunal" does not exhaust the category of bodies before which parliamentary proceedings must not be impeached or questioned. This is because section 16 provides that article 9 has the effect of the provisions of the section <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"in addition to any other operation".</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question is determined by the nature of the body, to its proceedings and of the detriment imposed on the member. The court would distinguish between mere withdrawal of political support, which obviously would not be unlawful, from anything in the nature of a penalty imposed on the member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that some procedures by which political parties impose Party discipline on their members may well be unlawful when imposed because of the members' activities in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I draw your attention also to paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of Resolution 6 of the Senate Privilege Resolutions setting out activities which may be treated as contempts:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Matters constituting contempts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Interference with the Senate</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)A person shall not improperly interfere with the free exercise by the Senate or a committee of its authority, or with the free performance by a Senator of the Senator's duties as a Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Improper influence of Senators</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)A person shall not, by fraud, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">intimidation</EMPHASIS>, force or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL">threat of any kind,</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> by the offer or promise of any inducement or benefit of any kind, or by other improper means, influence a Senator in the Senator's conduct as a Senator or induce a Senator to be absent from the Senate or a committee.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)A person shall not inflict any <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">punishment, penalty</EMPHASIS> or injury upon, or deprive of any benefit, a Senator on account of the Senator's conduct as a Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This precludes most methods of Party discipline. I also draw your attention to Clause 16 ss3 (a) (b) (c) under section 7 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth). With regard to individuals, section  7 provides for maximum penalties of six months imprisonment (ss1) or a fine up to $5,000 (ss 5 (a)). Under this section corporations are subject to maximum fines of $25,000. (ss 5 (b)). It does not matter if the organisation is incorporated under Commonwealth or State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the Senate resolutions and the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 preclude items 1 &amp; 2 of the resolution and therefore State Council will be in breach of these provisions if it considers them as grounds to support the resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view is confirmed by Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate, considered internationally as the ultimate authority on matters of privilege. His opinion is supported and confirmed by the Hon Clive Griffiths MLC, President of the Legislative Council in Western Australia who is also acknowledged as a distinguished authority on privilege. Mr Griffiths is the longest serving Presiding Officer in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However for the purposes of further deliberations I set out the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESTRAINING ORDER [as set out in the State Executive Resolution]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.1 You acknowledge that there was an incident which led your wife to take out a restraining order against you. (Hansard 30 March 1995 p2647).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">This statement was made by me in the Senate against my strongest objections. It was demanded of me by the Liberal Parliamentary Leader John Howard with the support of Senator Robert Hill, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Having been compelled to make a statement I drafted a short speech which gave considerably less concessions. This speech was unacceptable to John Howard as were two other versions. John Howard accepted a version to which Senator Hill made a significant contribution.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">However as I explained to Mr Howard and Senator Hill my comments in the parliament would give the material a status which could not be ignored by the media. How right I proved to be. Following the inevitable publicity Howard then asked me to stand down as Deputy President. This was a threat he made to me if I did not give the speech he requested.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Labor Party and the Democrats both supported my retention of the position.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act of stepping down gave the issue a further new life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The media were aware of the dirt sheet which contained some information about the matter however in very large part it had been ignored because of its nature. The editor of "The West Australian" for example made a deliberate editorial decision to ignore it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2That a restraining order had been taken out against you (even though not proceeded with) was the subject of widespread publicity in the media across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The fact that my wife had been granted a restraining order, not proceeded with and in fact was promptly withdrawn by my wife, was made public and was subject to publicity in the media due to Mr Ian Viner QC obtaining the order together with file notes from the Department of Justice and distributing it to other people. The document together with file notes were also distributed by Mr Cameron, the Liberal Federal Member for Stirling.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">That is a matter presently before the Legal Practitioners Board.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.3By reason of your standing in the Party and public profile through the media, the fact that a restraining order had been taken out against you and the publicity associated therewith has brought odium on the Party and reflects adversely upon it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">No restraining order was served on me, and no restraining order was effected upon me. Esther withdrew the order before it could be served. Her wish had been for exclusive rights to a family property. Her lawyer did not accompany her to the court. This was not Mr Viner QC. In  her confusion she found herself granted a restraining order. When she realised what had happened she had it withdrawn. It was a matter of which I knew nothing because it was never served upon me. </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the height of the controversy over allegations of the restraining order <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I engaged RM Quantum, the Liberal Party's pollsters,</EMPHASIS> to research the effect of the allegations and disclosures upon the voters.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further matters referring to the restraining order are outlined below:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the morning of Friday 24 March, the day before my preselection, Esther rang Mr Viner to tell him she was aware that he had and was disclosing a private conversation between he as a lawyer and she who had sought his advice. His initial preoccupation was to quiz Esther about who had told her of his disclosures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She asked the pertinent question, "Have you betrayed me?"  He said in response "No, I have not betrayed you."  Esther made it abundantly clear that she would be very upset and considered it a breach of lawyer confidentiality if he so disclosed matters discussed between them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Esther of course approached Mr Viner because she knew him to be a lawyer, a Liberal, and someone she had known for a considerable time. She assumed she could trust him, believing that if he was hostile to me he would never hurt her or our children, all of whom he knew well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That same day within hours of that conversation Mr Viner proceeded to visit the Court of Petty Sessions, requesting the restraining order which of course had never been served, and therefore not enforced. Mr Viner was attended to by a Mr Titelius, a clerk of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Titelius, for his part, had been a member of the Wembley Downs branch of the Liberal Party who defected to join Liz Constable's campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding instructions <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">on</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">in</EMPHASIS> the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">file,</EMPHASIS> of which Mr Titelius was well aware, saying that information from the file was not to be made available,  Mr Viner was given a copy of the restraining order by Mr Titelius. Mr Titelius had some hours earlier,  refused a  similar request from Mr Andrew Gaspar who is an employee of Mr Eoin Cameron, the Federal Liberal Member for Stirling  because he was not an interested party within the meaning of the Justices Act. I understand Mr Viner made no claim within the definition and applied for the order on the same basis as Mr Gaspar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Titelius left the file on the counter while he photocopied the restraining order. The time the file was left on the counter, either accidentally or by design was sufficient for Mr Viner to rummage through the file and make further hand written notes. Mr Viner most certainly must have seen the clear instructions on and in the file that he was not entitled to the restraining order or the notes he surreptitiously acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly after Mr Viner had obtained both the restraining order and additional information from the file, Eoin Cameron's  son Ryan Cameron, an employee of his collected these notes from Mr Viner and took them back to his electorate office where he had Andrew Gaspar, another employee, type them into a computer in Mr Cameron's electorate office in the form of an anonymous dirt sheet. The documents were subsequently distributed in the form of an anonymous dirt sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A considerable number of copies of the restraining order, copied in various bright colours, were located in Mr Cameron's office for access to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Mr Cameron's preselection he was asked the following questions by a member of his selection panel, from the Executive of the Stirling Division:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"I refer to a so called smear sheet or dirt sheet circulated prior to last Saturday's State Council Senate preselection in regard to personal information contained therein about Senator Crichton-Browne.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you know that the smear sheet was going to be circulated and if so did you or your staff directly or indirectly have anything to do with that circulation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also if you knew of people's intentions to sink to this type of gutter politics why did you not try to stop them or intervene in some way?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you condone this type of behaviour?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cameron answered "No" to the questions and in general terms replied in words to the effect that neither he nor his staff were involved in that kind of  campaign and nor would he condone it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This starkly contrasts with the facts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that an employee of Mr Cameron's sought information about Esther and myself, no doubt for the purpose of distributing it to smear me and in the process, hurting Esther and the children, not to mention the Liberal Party, of which the motion now before State Council complains.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the dirt sheet was distributed by Mr Cameron in an anonymous form.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cameron reproduced copies of the restraining order in bright colours, in large quantities also for distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cameron's officer sought this dirt the day before my preselection. Mr Gaspar had also some time previously sought material from Mrs Crichton-Browne's file and had of course then also had his request refused. However, he was not deterred and persisted in his attempts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SECTION 148 (1) of the Justices Act 1902 (WA) provides that only an interested party may obtain documents of the type obtained by Mr Viner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words "interested party" mean a party affected by the outcome of the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lawyer would be seen to be a "party interested" only if he or she was acting for a party to the action in the documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that several previous requests had been made by other sources including Mr Cameron's staff, on more than one occasion. Each had been refused on the above grounds. One can reasonably presume Mr Viner knew this and of the advice given to Mr Gaspar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand Mr Viner claims not to be a party to the action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">As to the further distribution of the various dirt sheets,</EMPHASIS> they were sent to members of the Liberal Party, my Federal and State parliamentary colleagues, the Labor Party and media across Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached photocopy of envelopes were sent to Mr Bob <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">FYFE</EMPHASIS> but misspelt as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">FUIFE</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fyfe has advised me that Senator Knowles is the only person who misspells his name as FUIFE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been advised in writing by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mrs Wendy Bartlett</EMPHASIS> that the only person in the Liberal Party who writes to her from time to time is Senator Sue Knowles. I am further advised that the only person who spells her address as 5 <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Curry</EMPHASIS> Grove rather than 5 <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Currie</EMPHASIS> Grove is Senator Knowles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached photocopy is of envelopes which were received by Mrs Bartlett and contained in one, was a dirt sheet relating to a restraining order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ian Dewar</EMPHASIS> that he receives correspondence from Senator Sue Knowles, occasionally from Mr Allan Rocher as his local member on the basis of being a constituent not a Party member and occasionally from head office soliciting donations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached photocopy of his envelope contained a dirt sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Dewar was a member of Stirling Division some years ago and has continued to receive correspondence from Senator Knowles since his membership expired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know who acquired Senator Knowles data base or who posted the letter with the dirt sheet in it, however it was this campaign that not only did great damage to me, brought enormous hurt and suffering to my family but which lead to "the publicity associated with" as it is referred to in the State Executive resolution. To blame me for the publicity of the matter is ridiculous and borders on the absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">This is but a small sample of available evidence.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the administration of the Party is concerned about the publicity they would as Dr Honey once publicly promised, investigate the distribution of the dirt and smear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A simple examination of the data bases of each Federal Liberal member of parliament would be an elementary step in beginning the process of discovering those who in their unrelenting, crude and vile campaign against me, are so wilfully and recklessly prepared to wreak so much damage upon the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't claim to know, other than that outlined in respect to Mr Cameron, what part if any, was played by members of parliament in providing Liberal Party and other membership lists, however no doubt the Liberal Party could begin to enquire. To my knowledge, they have done no more than write to each member asking for the lists, at my suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt for their part, the innocent members of parliament would wish to be thoroughly exonerated.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. SEXIST COMMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On my memory of events the quotes provided by the Liberal Party which seem to be taken directly from Colleen Egan's article in The Australian on 2 August 1995, are taken out of context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not show Colleen Egan how I voted however she most certainly saw how I voted. When she appeared to write it down I did use the words or words similar to that quoted by Miss Egan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This comment was made in the midst of banter of a nature not unknown between journalists and members of Parliament whom they know when talking "off the record".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of trivial historical record, the expression was first used in Australia perhaps in a more colourful way in 1988 by the hostess of Great Temptation Barbie Rogers. Barbie Rogers, who did not know her microphone was on immediately prior to introducing a midday movie said "If you don't, I'll rip your t..s off", warning viewers to watch the movie:<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> SYDNEY MORNING HERALD 4 August 1995</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expression was the subject of a conversation in 1973 between US Attorney-General, John Mitchell, and reporter Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bernstein had asked whether Mitchell had been involved in illegally raising campaign funds. Mitchell responded with a reference to Katherine Graham, the publisher of the paper: "If you print that, Katie Graham is gonna get her t.. caught in a big fat wringer."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">George Negus used the expression when referring to the ABC popularising serious subjects in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But as soon as they do it, the commercials start screaming their t..s off that they're doing it too well."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect to the second expression attributed to me, my memory of events is that Miss Egan asked me several times for the number of my hotel suite, and finally I responded with words to the effect, "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Why do you want to know, do you want to sleep with me?</EMPHASIS>"   This is hardly the sort of conversation I would have on the record. I should add that my family were with me in the suite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This conversation was of course completely off the record as is obvious by its nature. The banter was jocular and within the ambience which exists between Members of Parliament and journalists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LIEBMAN:  "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I was just going to say, in response to all of this, Crichton-Browne is saying that the comments he made were, quote off the record and were in the ambience of frivolity, they were a joke."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EGAN:  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"They were in that, if you like the word ambience, and we had been joking earlier, he was in a very jovial mood and I accept that, that was his version of a joke. I don't see it as anything but that and I've never said that it was."</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> TODAY PROGRAM STEVE LIEBMAN/COLLEEN EGAN</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This conversation would never have been made public had it not been for the fact that a member of the Liberal Party, described to me as a bitter enemy, contacted Margo Kingston of the Sydney Morning Herald. Kingston is also known as a strong opponent of mine due in part, I believe, to her close relationships with Mrs Judi Moylan and Senator Sue Knowles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the conversation between Miss Egan and myself, which was apparently overheard, Miss Egan was approached by a group of Liberal Party women described to me as bitter enemies of mine. In fact Miss Egan described them to me as "Anne Hector type haters."  Miss Egan was pestered and badgered by these people to report the conversation in her paper "The Australian", however she refused because as she said the conversation was off the record and private.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequently at least one of these people rang Margo Kingston in Canberra and conveyed to her the substance of what they believed to be the conversation between Miss Egan and myself for the purpose of having the story published. It was done with wilful and malicious intent to damage the Party and myself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Miss Egan has said she did not find the comments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">sexist, threatening or insulting. Miss Egan rang me to say that she had told Dr Honey prior to his public comments that if he publicly called on me to apologise to her she would publicly disassociate herself from him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is well known within the Liberal Party this is not the manner or style of my conversation with women in spite of anonymous Liberal women telling Miss Egan that it was not unusual. As Miss Egan has said, "the women some of his most vicious critics, say they have long resented what they perceive to be his sexist behaviour."  This untruth was manufactured as a further attempt to pressure Miss Egan into writing a story.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When all else failed these people rang Margo Kingston to have the story, for which I am now condemned, published. She would have relished the task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I said in the circumstances was not detrimental to the Party but rather the publication, connived and urged by Liberal Party opponents to damage me and also the Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Miss Egan says one woman, in an attempt to encourage her to publish the conversation said to her "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People should know what the most powerful man in the (State) Liberal Party is like.</EMPHASIS>"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Margie Bass, President of the State Women's Council of the Liberal Party, for one, may well claim to be outraged by my private comments however when Eoin Cameron was brought before State Executive for his public statements criticising the Party, the leader and the Premier, Mrs Bass vigorously defended him and clapped him when he rose to leave the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Bass had a different view of Mr Cameron at the 1994 Kalgoorlie Central Annual Divisional Conference held at Exmouth on 14 May 1994. She approached me during the Saturday morning session to tell me she had flown up in Senator Sue Knowles' charter aircraft accompanied by Mr Eoin Cameron, the Federal Member for Stirling, and Mrs Anne Griffiths, a member of the Liberal Party. During the flight <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Cameron had said</EMPHASIS> to her in the midst of a conversation <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"We all know you Margie, you like young men with big c. . . s."</EMPHASIS> Mrs Bass expressed her disgust at the way in which Senator Knowles "rolled around the plane laughing" at the smut. That rather contrasts with the vocal support and acclamation for Mr Cameron when brought before State Executive for disciplinary reasons. I do not believe Mrs Bass made any formal complaint to the Party about Mr Cameron's conduct. However she was quite distressed when she spoke to me. She would hardly come complaining to me if that was my manner of speaking to women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I of course chose not to pass Mr Cameron's comments on to the media. Had I chosen to, no doubt it would have caused considerable pain to Mr Cameron, no doubt some embarrassment to Mrs Bass and damage to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that it did not receive publicity was due to my decency and my concern for the effect it would have on the Liberal Party, whatever I may think of Mr Cameron.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I raise this matter to demonstrate how private conversations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when improperly disclosed, have a capacity to develop a life of their own and I respectfully suggest that there are different standards being set between various members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I submit with respect that the matter of my private conversation with Miss Colleen Egan was in itself unexceptional, although seen in black and white and out of context as crude. However, it would really have never seen the light of day without the actual and determined actions of a group of bitter Liberal women opponents who when they failed to have Miss Egan run the story had it conveyed to Margo Kingston. Miss Egan as I have reported has said the matter was a private joke between the two of us and was not for reporting.</PARA>

Frankly if the State President was concerned about the publicity the issue attracted, he should have been politically mature enough to realise he was creating the news and keeping the issue alive. I said very little about the issue but Dr Honey kept it alive for days and now weeks. I counselled from the outset against a public response. Price in particular subsequently articulated my political judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The story was dead until the Party's comments on my private conversation created a story of their own.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that at the State Conference of the Party in July 1995, I publicly called for the expulsion of unspecified persons from the membership of the Liberal Party. It is further claimed these remarks were divisive and undermined calls and attempts by members of the Party to create unity and harmony in the Party.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only inference that can be drawn from this interview is that Don Randall was responsible for Margie Bass' apparent demise and that, being allegedly aligned with me, I am ultimately responsible. I did not know about the meeting until contacted by Howard Sattler the following day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Bass has stated that I must be expelled from the Party, that my conduct at State Conference was disgraceful, that in essence I am rude and arrogant, that the media feeling about me is so strong that if I am not expelled, we will lose the next election. She states that I have always said that the Party must come first and, that issue, is one to be confronted tonight with me being expelled, so as to put the Party first. Except for Mrs Bass' reference to my private conversation with Colleen Egan, the grounds upon which she claims I should be expelled are of her own construction and most certainly are not the grounds contained in the resolution, carried at the State Executive of 21 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Bass' attitude and demeanour toward me, when addressing other people in respect to the motion before State Executive was one of subjective and bitter vitriol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BIAS&mdash;PRESIDENT MOORE DIVISION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I submit that the President of Moore Division, Mrs Marie Louise Wordsworth, has determined a pre-conceived outcome of this resolution, and stated that she proposed regardless of the evidence, to vote for the motion before State Executive prior the meeting even being held. She has said that if State Executive voted not to expel me, that they "have no standards."  She said there was no place in the Liberal Party for "wife whackers". She said she could see nothing wrong with Mr Viner's conduct, which of course is the very cause of one of the items before State Executive. She could see nothing wrong with Mr Tomlinson's conduct, because like Viner, he was not a "wife whacker." That, together with other comments, demonstrates that Mrs Wordsworth is in a pre-conceived position regarding the matter, and should be disqualified from these proceedings accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I spoke to Tony Goode at 3.40pm on Thursday 7 August 1995. I said I was not lobbying him because I though it was not proper, nor fruitful.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the Federal Members have shown pre-conceived bias and to that extent, Mr Howard's representative Mr Prosser and every other Federal Member should be disqualified from sitting on the State Executive meeting.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no reason to believe Mr Howard even knew the grounds and he most certainly was not at the State Executive meeting so he could not have made those comments on the basis of the facts or the arguments. In other words, Mr Howard was not judging the decision on the facts, the arguments or the merits of the case.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the public conduct and statements of some of my colleagues, that paragraph is not without a touch of irony and in the more historic sense I recall Mr Tuckey appearing on <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ABC Four Corners</EMPHASIS> bragging about how he got Peacock elected to the Party leadership, how he lied to the press and sadly destroyed Peacock and any chance of winning the 1990 election. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I recall no comment from the Party at that time at all.</EMPHASIS> Mr Tuckey had previously been told by Mr Peacock's office not to participate in the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report&mdash;a request which he defied because as he said to me, "I didn't intend to allow others to take credit for what I had done."</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Kalgoorlie South Divisional Conference held at Kalgoorlie on Saturday 2 September Dr Honey was asked why people who had been making public statements had not been expelled. In fact as I recall Messrs Viner and Tomlinson may have been mentioned by name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Honey responded in words to the effect that disciplinary proceedings within the Party were very much intended to ensure the smooth running of the Party and political judgements had to be made as to the level of disruption which expulsions would cause.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expelling Tomlinson and Viner was too hard but he thinks expelling me is not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, Dr Honey was stating that he as State President was not applying the constitution in an even handed and impartial way, to say nothing of the legal imperatives which flow from the constitution of an incorporated body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be held that if you are a notorious trouble maker who is well known as a source of internal Party information to the media, and the President judges that you are "too difficult to handle", particularly given that you may have support for your conduct then you are exempt from the rules and standards applying to others. If you are a little old retiree without a base of support in the Party you may be an easy target. Alternatively if there is a political judgement made that irrespective of consistency, precedent, fairness or justice, it is deemed desirable to expel someone for all the wrong legal reasons, then a different standard is set. The tyranny of Presidents and office bearers making subjective political judgements becomes a ramrod against the bastion of democracy and the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts and grounds of each case are ignored and disregarded contrary to the constitution. On that basis, there need be no reason to provide grounds&mdash;a total denial of natural justice and constitutional requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great evil of any body or society of men and women is the suspension of the rules, the abuse of the rules or the contrived use of the rules for reasons other than their proper intention. When the leaders of an association or body apply the rules to achieve their own views and judgements, the whole process is corrupted and the leadership destroys the integrity, goodwill, faith and respect of those they are elected to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not a question of my conduct or my public statements but rather the fact that I am seen or perceived by these dissidents as symbolic of their opposition which prevents them achieving their objectives. They are unable to win the intellectual will of the majority of people at various fora of the Party with their arguments so they seek to impose their will upon the majority by waging a war against the Party and me in particular, through the media. Truth is their first casualty, political fortunes of the Party are second and the reputation of individuals and their families third.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Below are further examples of the type of unwarranted publicity imposed upon me and the Party by those who claim I am now to be punished for their public smear campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In so doing, I include a summary of the letter sent by me to you on the 25th of July outlining the scurrilous allegations made against me claiming I had made death threats and obscene phone calls to a fellow Liberal parliamentarian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dear. . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"On Wednesday evening of the 21st June, every television network in Australia ran as their  first news item<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> allegations that I had made death threats and obscene phone calls to a Senate colleague.</EMPHASIS> The allegations went on to claim that I had been interviewed by the Federal Police in respect to the matter. These threatening and obscene telephone calls were supposed to have been made to a Federal politician in Perth and Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For your edification I set out the true facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first visit by the Federal Police to my office took place on Friday 16 June 1995 at <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">my</EMPHASIS> request. This request was the result of criminal matters which I wanted investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police have treated the matter with the utmost seriousness and are pursuing the matters with vigour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Federal Police were in my office a junior officer arrived to join the meeting.  Waiting to come into my office, he was asked by someone other than my staff whether he was being attended to. In good faith the officer disclosed that he was a Federal Police officer and he was visiting my office. Need I say any more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Monday the 19th June Channel 9 in Perth contacted their Canberra bureau, who then asked me about allegations that I had made threatening phone calls, and as a result had been interviewed by the Federal Police. I conveyed to the Canberra bureau that the claims were utter nonsense and I naturally expected to hear no more about it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Tuesday 20th June, one hour before the Perth news was broadcast, I was informed by Channel 9 that the story, as conveyed to me the previous day was going to air.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I formally advised Channel 9 that these allegations were utterly untrue and I would sue them if they ran the story. On the advice of their lawyers the story did not go to air.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, failing to have the story run by giving this false information to the media, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">those Liberal sources then gave the information to the ALP. </EMPHASIS>John Kobelke raised the same allegations under parliamentary privilege, thus protecting the media and allowing them to run the story.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can think of few more disgusting and outrageous claims than those made against me by Mr Kobelke with lies given to him by<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> members of the Liberal Party.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediately following the publication of the allegations through the various media outlets I was inundated with media requests for a comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the day the Federal Police had, with my approval, been saying "no comment". The reason for that was quite simple. The investigations which arose as a result of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">my </EMPHASIS>complaint, were  of a covert nature and neither I nor the Federal Police wanted these operations to be exposed or compromised. Late in the afternoon the Federal Police contacted me to say that they thought they should put out a short statement to clear me of the allegations, to which I agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequently the State Police also put out a statement which also put  lie to the claims made against me. I made a very brief statement in the Senate refuting the claims without ever acknowledging that I had spoken to or lodged a complaint with the Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net effect is that a most serious complaint of a criminal nature made by me to the Federal Police has resulted in a nation-wide media saturation that <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I </EMPHASIS>was being investigated for making death threats to a Federal colleague. I leave it to you to imagine the effect that has had upon our family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this Party is to allow Members of Parliament and their innocent families' lives, reputations and careers to be destroyed by a small band who have no regard for decency, privacy and least of all for the well being of the Liberal Party we shall stand condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To what level will this little band of dissidents sink. The allegations have of course brought great hurt and suffering to  Esther and our children, who seem to be fair game in these sordid attempts to attack me by foul means because fair means have failed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NOEL CRICHTON-BROWNE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This highlights the style of campaign which has been waged against me in the media and which has caused the type of publicity which damages the Party, myself and my family. I know of no inquiries by the Party to deal with such conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various dirt sheets which have been anonymously circulated by Liberals using Liberal Federal Members' data bases are a matter of public record. I know of no action by the Party to deal with this except to collect a number of envelopes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One allegation for instance asserted that I had fraudulently made an insurance claim for a damaged mobile phone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One dirt sheet asserted that I had beaten up a female friend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One claim implied my 2 year old son who strangled in his cot, died in suspicious circumstances. How sick are these people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent rumour has me as a homosexual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal sources fabricated a document alleging I am an anti Semitic Jew Hater and gave the forgery to John Halden of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Barbara-Dene Jones as President of Tangney Division circulated a document claiming to be the substance of confidential State Executive deliberations in which she made certain untrue allegations against me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not satisfied with their best efforts, a member of the group who produced and distributed the dirt sheets, had the media ring a former employee of mine who had in the past been a personal assistant to me. The purpose of the call was ask her to confirm a number of untruths which had been passed on to them and to enquire as to whether the lady had any dirt on me she would care to pass on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By process of elimination, it was not difficult from the line of questioning to establish that the source was either a parliamentarian or an employee of a parliamentarian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also attracted adverse publicity with various named and unnamed sources claiming that I was responsible for Paul Filing and Allan Rocher losing their preselection, together with Brian Hilbert being unsuccessful in the Federal preselection for Swan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Mr Howard rang me to say he wished me not to attend further Party meetings I asked him for what reason. He responded that "this would not have happened if I had not been so intransigent two months ago."  In other words I was to be blamed for Filing's and Rocher's preselection failures. I was on my way to another meeting so the conversation was brief, however the message was clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These claims are totally untrue and without foundation and in the case of Moore, at my request, the State President fully investigated Mr Filing's claim some months ago and found it to be without a shred of evidence and said so publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Cameron and Filing were confronted by myself and John Howard in the Leader's office about claims made by them to the leader that I was seeking to undermine their preselection, much to their embarrassment neither could give one name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People in the divisions of Stirling, Moore and Curtin know that I was not involved, however it is a story peddled to Howard by Rocher and Filing, together with others seeking to damage me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPEATED REFUSAL TO COMMENT</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following is a brief summary of events which bring us to the present unpleasant circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE FACTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATE EXECUTIVE 7 AUGUST 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was first advised either on the 7th August or the day before that a State Executive meeting was to be held to consider correspondence which had taken place between the State President and myself on the 2nd August 1995 and 4th August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That correspondence related to my private conversation with Colleen Egan which sadly the State President made public in a press conference he called. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>My request to be present at the State Executive to answer any claims which may have been made against me was denied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I first spoke to the State President at 3.30pm on the day of the meeting (7 August) and asked that I be allowed to attend. His response was that if I did request to attend the State Executive, then it was likely the request would be granted. However if I attended and was seen to be successful in my representations it would make the President and the Premier look weak. Dr Honey advised me that the media would all be at Menzies House and would therefore be aware of my attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said in that case, I would not persist in my request, not wishing to compromise either the Premier or the State President, particularly since I had been led to believe no action against me was to be taken. In fact I understood the motion to be moved was simply one endorsing the comments and actions of the President and the Premier and the matter was to be ruled off at that point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That fact was conveyed to me, amongst others, by the Premier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is an understanding, I believe, shared by others. Most certainly the very senior office bearers of the Party were not aware of the proposed action by the President, and nor was the Premier. Many others were also apparently unaware that they were to be confronted with such an important resolution. I understood no agenda was provided to members of State Executive prior to the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I subsequently rang Dr Honey at 5.20pm on the same day and asked that in the event any motion was to be moved, which in any way reflected upon me, then I formally requested the right to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Honey acknowledged my request, but gave no indication any such motion was to be moved. I have reason to believe Dr Honey changed his mind in respect to the motion, or had his mind changed for him between 3.30pm &amp; 5.30pm (the time of the meeting).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my understanding that the State President did not even put my request to attend the meeting to the members of State Executive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The practice of the Party has been always been to give notice and provide an opportunity to members of the organisation and the Parliamentary Party who are subject to disciplinary proceedings.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Honey's motion certainly falls within the general category and principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently Senator Knowles and Mr Cameron were both asked to attend State Executive to explain their criticism of their colleagues and the leader.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both were provided with the motion, or the purpose of the meeting, well in advance, and a time of mutual convenience was set by State Executive to hear their responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was not a courtesy extended to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Senator Knowles' case the motion was no more than: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State Executive expresses its grave concern at the public statements made by Senator Knowles following the Federal Parliamentary Party leadership ballot, particularly those statements which reflect upon her colleagues and the leader Mr Alexander Downer.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Executive notes in particular Senator Knowles' comments in her interview of 23 May with Mr Peter Kennedy on the ABC radio "Drive Time" program and her further interview with Mr Peter Newman on "6PR Breakfast" on Friday 27 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Executive instructs the Acting State Director to convey the terms of this resolution to Senator Knowles and to remind her of the damaging effect upon the Party of such public statements."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Mr Cameron's case the motion was similar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the evening of the 7th August the State President rang me at home to inform me that State Executive had carried a motion calling upon me to resign. He gave me no explanation or reason and I made no comment other than to acknowledge his call and terminated the conversation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequently on the 8th August I received a letter signed by the Western Australian Liberal Party State Director, Peter Wells, informing me of a motion passed at a meeting of State Executive held on 7 August calling on me to resign, still giving no explanation, no grounds and no justification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"To avoid further damage to the Liberal Party, Senator Noel Crichton-Browne be asked to resign immediately from the Party.</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As will be shown the motion moved by the State President on 7th August was a defacto expulsion motion to the extent that if  I did not resign the State President intended to move for my expulsion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that I was <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">not advised in advance </EMPHASIS>of the motion the President intended to move, that <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I was refused the grounds</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">for the motion</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">refused the right to attend,</EMPHASIS> I believe that my standing in the Party and the community was improperly compromised and damaged. It is a clear denial of natural justice which one would barely expect of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the motion was to lead to an expulsion motion set a process in place which by the very dynamics of politics was bound to influence members of State Executive in their further deliberations. Having been allowed to arrive at a conclusion about my alleged conduct and the subsequent penalty without proper and due process has inevitably lead to a denial of natural justice. Had, for instance, I been present and presented a persuasive case and the motion was defeated I would not now be confronted with an expulsion motion as it is euphemistically called by Dr Honey.</PARA>

I have subsequently learnt that decision was not the subject of an agreed resolution by State Executive.</PARA>

But also, that grounds for expulsion had now been found. As late as 6th August he claimed publicly that it was not in the interests of the Party to expel me and, there was no talk of resignation. In fact he told a number of members of the State Executive on the 7th August that the motion would ask State Executive to confirm his and the Premier's statements to that time and rule the issue off. That was the Premier's understanding as conveyed to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the resignation motion, by his own admission, was a defacto expulsion motion, he had within 24 hours found grounds to move a motion to expel me from the Liberal Party of Western Australia.

The reason for that is the role of the President is to bring together all the different groups and interests within the Liberal Party, and make sure they're all working together for the common cause of supporting Richard Court and John Howard. Now that hasn't happened. It's clear that Dr Honey has adopted a very partisan view when it comes to Senator Crichton-Browne and his opponents.

Not just those whom he favours."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"Well there's no doubt that there is a serious crisis affecting the West Australian Liberal Party.</EMPHASIS> The thing is though, these issues have been bubbling along for many years, it hasn't just suddenly come out of thin air. And the problem is, or the good timing of the situation at the moment, is that it's two years to the next state election, it's probably twelve months to the next federal election, this is an ideal opportunity for the Party to cleanse itself of the problems that have made life in the Liberal Party, for the last two federal leaders, including John Howard, somewhat of a problem."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Well yes it is doing well (electorally), but that's the ultimate of ironies. The three federal members of parliament, who are under most immediate threat, Evans, Paul Filing and Eoin Cameron, are the only three members of parliament in the Liberal Party who won their seats off Labor in this decade. So it's quite strange the three most successful people in the 90s who have won their seats from the ALP, are the three who are under the most imminent threat."</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past eight weeks you will have been witness to what has been described in The West Australian as a campaign of  <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"public vilification of Senator Crichton-Browne". </EMPHASIS>This campaign has been pursued through the media by a small group of Liberals who have indulged in the worst campaign of character assassination perhaps ever launched against a parliamentary member of the Liberal Party,. They have also done great damage to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little did I know what they were really capable of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I notice that Sir Charles Court has also been criticised in the media by Liberals. His sin apparently was that he was supporting the endorsed Liberal candidate at the request of the Party. There was a time in the Liberal Party when support of the endorsed Liberal candidate, through thick and thin whether or not he or she was our particular choice, was the proper and honourable thing to do.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two ways to guarantee cheap publicity&mdash;attack your own Party and your own members of  parliament. The media love it and voters will leave in droves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than to point out the fact that Mr Huston, the endorsed candidate for Floreat was at the time of his preselection barely known to me and that I played no part in his preselection, I steadfastly refused prior to the Floreat by election polling day to provide the media with any comment which may have damaged our prospects of success during the Floreat by election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understood that the role of members of parliament was to get behind the endorsed candidate and try to win the seat for the Liberal Party, not to enter into a war of words, not to attack other members of parliament and not to attack the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not now intend to give respectability to these despicable attacks. I believe they have been dealt with by the State President, Mr Peter Jones, Sir Charles Court and others. However, with the by election and state conference behind us and in the interests of fairness and an informed Liberal Party, I set out a number of other matters which I believe deserve to be explained and understood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that on 18 June Barry MacKinnon called a press conference following the resignation of a Mr David Smith from the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clear implication flowing from that press conference was that I was involved in the Floreat preselection. Barry did not name me but background briefing of journalists by others did.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The media was not convinced that the leader would call a press conference simply over the resignation of a relatively obscure Party official. That predictably invited media speculation about Barry MacKinnon's leadership, my contribution to the Liberal Party and, perhaps more particularly and damaging, the legitimacy of the endorsement of the Liberal Party's candidate for the State seat of Floreat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subsequent events are of course now self evident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is totally incorrect for it to be claimed by anyone that I was in any way involved in the affairs or the outcome of the Floreat preselection or that Mr Huston was my candidate. I hardly knew Mr Huston and I am not familiar with the branches in the electorate. Had Barry contacted me or others he would have learnt that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had no particular interest or concern in the outcome of the Floreat preselection. During my four years as State President, for better or worse, not one sitting member of Parliament lost his/her preselection and not one was able to claim thanks to me for his/her success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In truth Barry MacKinnon's press conference should not have been about one of his colleagues but about those who seemed determined to wreck the Party to get their candidate endorsed or elected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to media reports, the only two Parliamentarians who expressed a view about any of the candidates for endorsement were Barry himself and Philip Pendal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both MacKinnon and Pendal were known to be backing Constable and Pendal said so at a Cottesloe Women's meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Barry MacKinnon's press conference following the resignation of a relatively obscure Party  member wherein much was made of the alleged involvement of unnamed members of Parliament, set in train a series of events which gave failed candidates and their supporters a public cause for their campaign.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The endorsed Liberal candidate's prospects were not helped during the campaign by the reported comments of Mr Chaney when he was quoted in The West Australian on 12 July 1991 following Mr Davies' resignation saying of Mr Reg Davies' actions, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"But of what I know of Reg he had no other honourable course left but to leave."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one seemed to know why he resigned except that he was fourth on the Upper House ticket and thought his chances of re-election were better as an Independent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Chaney was also reported as reflecting adversely on his own Party during the campaign when he was quoted as saying, "Liberals who went around saying there was nothing wrong with the Party were either knaves or fools."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His further public comments about me and the internal affairs of the Party were equally unhelpful to the campaign to hold the seat of Floreat for the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Derrick Tomlinson's claims of "corruption" within the Liberal Party in the midst of the by election can only have helped the independent candidate. One who calls "rotten fish for sale" is hardly likely to attract customers or, in our case, voters. His statement within a forum of the Party that he would not be campaigning for the endorsed Liberal candidate because Elizabeth Constable was a friend of his is hardly the conduct one would expect from a shadow minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Tomlinson's further public comments during the campaign about his future within the Party can only have further damaged the Liberal Party's prospects of winning the seat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I further observe that Barry's press conference stimulated talk and speculation about a leadership challenge which I understand from the media arose simply because they were and remain at a loss as to why he called the press conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No Federal member worked harder for him or his team in the last State election and I have publicly continued to give him my unqualified support and commitment since, a matter which barely need stating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I assume I can expect the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I asked for neither reward, nor recompense. I declined a number of preselections and when I stepped down after four years as State President, the Party was in excellent shape. I therefore take grave offence at the accusations recently made against me. It seems to me that those with the most to say have made the least contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been mischief made in the media about my attitude to multiple proxy voting,  [stimulated by Chaney, Tomlinson and the dissidents] <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the history of multiple voting in the Party and the outcome of the state conference constitutional amendments.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.</EMPHASIS> The present alleged problems arose as a result of the re-writing of the Constitution in 1987 during the period of Mr Keith Simpson's presidency and at the time Mr Derrick Tomlinson was a State Vice President.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.</EMPHASIS> I opposed the new Constitution at the time these gentlemen were enthusiastically supporting it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ATTACK ON SENIOR PARTY OFFICIALS BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT&mdash;PHILLIP PENDAL</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most blatant attack upon officers of the Liberal Party by a member of parliament came from the Hon Phillip Pendal, then the Liberal Member for South Metropolitan Province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In parliament under privilege but more particularly in a public forum, Mr Pendal first attacked the then chairman of the Central Campaign Committee in which he dredged up dirt upon Mr Bacich and then followed by a further attack upon the State President, Mr Barrie Payne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Pendal's excuse for publicly attacking the campaign chairman in the parliament was that he had complained to "very senior people in the Liberal Party in the state" but nothing had been done in response. That certainly leaves me with the feeling of deja vu.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Pendal went on to say</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"a number of important things are happening with the Liberal Party in this state. There will be a bit more bloodshed before the day comes when the Liberal Party is restored to its former greatness. I believe that is not a long way down the track and I personally hope to see Mr Barrie Payne removed as the President of this state. . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that people, most particularly the Liberals, around the state will come to understand that the Liberal Party has great difficulties. However, they are difficulties surrounding a very small clique of people who are not representative of true Liberalism and the sooner that the cancer is cut out the better the Liberal Party will be."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this was said in the parliament in front of the Labor Party with the media taking it all in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not one single member of State Executive moved a motion of condemnation, censure, suspension or expulsion of Mr Pendal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ironically Mr Bacich was expelled some time later for describing some of the front bench of the Liberal Party opposition as dunderheads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, I make the point that there is a gulf of difference between my trifling, irreverent comments which are now being used as a ground  for Liberal Party expulsion and a brutal and premeditated attack upon two senior members of the State Executive by Mr Phillip Pendal then a state member of parliament which attracted no action at all by the Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not claim precedence as the full measure of justice, however it demonstrated not only the varying standards of the Party but more particularly the contrast shows the shallow and feeble substance of this ground in the resolution before State Council as it relates to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have on several occasions asked the State President to investigate or take action when public attacks have been made on me by people such as Mr Alistair Tomlinson, Mr Viner, Barbara-Dene Jones, Mrs Hector and Mr Eoin Cameron just to name a few.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I intend to make a contribution on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases, a committee on which I had the honour to serve. The committee produced a report entitled: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The public interest revisited</EMPHASIS>. But more fundamental than that is the question of integrity of our political structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today our newspapers heralded headlines such as `She lied', `Lawrence a liar' and others of like nature. Those headlines were about a senior minister, Dr Carmen Lawrence. Today we witnessed the Democrats and Greens combining with Labor to defeat a call to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to sack Dr Lawrence. The implication of the vote is that the slogan of the Democrats should be changed from `keeping the bastards honest' to `keep the bastards honest, except if they happen to lie'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the evidence is so overwhelming that the conclusions reached by Mr Marks QC were to be expected, today we have witnessed all sorts of tactics, somersaults and empty rhetoric to somehow explain why the Greens, Democrats and Labor combined to defeat the motion moved by the opposition. However, I give credit to Senator Harradine who voted with us; he usually exercises a fair and genuine mind on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The public interest revisited</EMPHASIS>, there is a section entitled `Ethics and attitudinal change'. We as a committee unanimously quoted, with approval, from the previous whistleblowing committee. It said that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . believed that recent programs in ethics and accountability, particularly in the public sector, would be a useful base from which to emphasise, in positive terms for the organisation and ultimately the public interest, the benefits of reporting wrongdoing, accepting such reports and taking appropriate investigative and corrective action.</PARA>
<PARA>The very next paragraph then tells us that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revised guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants were issued in March 1995. In launching the revised guidelines, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Mr Gary Johns MP, emphasised that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important part of the quote&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`ethics and honesty were a key to modern and effective public service'.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that: ethics and honesty were a key to modern and effective public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence has been found to be dishonest and to have acted improperly by Mr Marks QC. I wonder if Mr Johns thinks that Dr Lawrence is somehow involved in public service and that the standards he would set for public servants around this country should also apply to Dr Lawrence&mdash;that things such as `ethics and honesty are a key to modern and effective public service'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is interesting to see how the Labor Party played out this Dr Lawrence issue. Dr Lawrence continually denied her involvement in the Easton petition. However, a former minister in her government, who also happens to be a minister of religion, Reverend Keith Wilson, found that it was necessary for him to blow the whistle on Dr Lawrence's denials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that on the front cover of this report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The public interest revisited</EMPHASIS> there is a newspaper headline reproduced `Tell and be damned'. Of course that is exactly what happened to Reverend Keith Wilson. He said, in effect, Dr Lawrence is lying. So what happened? A campaign was orchestrated to say that Reverend Wilson had a few problems; Reverend Wilson was this and Reverend Wilson was that and you really could not believe what he was saying. As a result of that campaign, another minister, a female minister, in Dr Lawrence's government felt compelled to come out and support Reverend Wilson in his allegations and statements because she thought he was being ostracised and treated most unfairly by the campaign to discredit him when he was in fact telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who sat on this committee and took evidence all around the country heard time and time again what happens to you if you are a whistleblower trying to expose the truth. Those against whom you are telling the truth, who have something to hide, will come out and say, `They are a bit disturbed. You know they have not really got their facts together. Let's pity them. Let's belittle them and let's try to make them look a little bit foolish.' That is exactly what Labor people tried to do to Reverend Keith Wilson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence was found to be a liar not on the evidence of any Liberal Party member, National Party member or conservative person in politics but on the evidence of her own staff members who, under oath, felt the need and compulsion to tell the truth. Her former ministers, even her own Deputy Premier, had to give evidence and say she did tell a lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence, through her legal counsel, tried to attack and belittle each one of those people in the methods and tactics of cross-examination. So it is quite appropriate that in relation to Mr Zoltan Kovacs, a former Lawrence staff member, Commissioner Marks found him to be a manifestly honest witness. He said, `Kovacs was deeply affected by what occurred.' He said, `. . . in my opinion his integrity is not in question.' One wonders whether anybody in the Greens, Democrats or Labor honestly can say the same thing about Dr Carmen Lawrence, that her integrity is not in question. Clearly, it is more than in question; it has been found to be wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we also had what I consider to be quite an astounding attack on the findings, that somehow it all had to do with some men not liking women and so this was a way to try to attack a woman in public life. For those of us who read the papers, does Niki Savva from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun Herald</EMPHASIS> have that view? Does Michelle Grattan from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> have that view? Indeed, does Margo Kingston from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> have that view? I hardly think so. But those journalists wrote, I think, pretty balanced articles about Dr Lawrence's future and what it ought to be. I suppose even the former female minister who felt compelled to speak out against what Dr Lawrence had done would also somehow hate women who have succeeded in public life. Really, all the arguments that have been put forward are unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also on the cover of this report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Public Interest Revisited</EMPHASIS> is another headline `Crusaders for the truth'. Then there is a subheadline, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whistleblowers are vital to anti-corruption inquiries . . . but they often suffer ostracism, abuse or the sack . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Who was involved in trying to establish the truth in this royal commission? It was Ms Vanstone QC. Remember her being attacked? Remember her being ostracised? Mr Marks QC, who had the job of sifting through all the evidence&mdash;remember him being attacked? Remember how he was vilified by the Prime Minister and other Labor Party people? That is exactly what happens to whistleblowers and the sorts of people who try to get at the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply repeat the view of Mr Johns, a Labor minister, as to how public servants ought to act. He said that ethics and honesty were a key to modern and effective public service. I suggest that the Labor Party apply that standard to Dr Lawrence, that the Greens apply that standard and the Democrats apply that standard. If they did apply that standard, Dr Lawrence would do the honourable thing and resign. If she does not resign, then the Prime Minister ought to keep ethics and honesty high on the political agenda and sack her. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Collins. I acknowledge that interjection. I have chosen to ignore his threats and intimidation and get on with the job for which I have been elected, which is to represent the Liberal Party and also the people of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertions that have been made by the senator about my role in disclosing his record of domestic violence are just plain wrong. While I do admit to knowing of the most serious event, because he told me the day after what he had done, and he subsequently told others, I have not sought to use that against him in the six years that have elapsed, in spite of his greatest provocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disturbed me, as a consequence, that the senator's estranged wife&mdash;whom, I might add, I assisted to stay in hiding for over 12 months&mdash;telephoned me just after midnight soon after the disclosure of the restraining order this year and accused me of betraying her trust. I also totally reject that, as my staff, friends and I had sought to be totally supportive and retain the expected respect for her position associated with such a totally distressing time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore reject absolutely the assertion that I somehow facilitated the use of my mailing list for the distribution of the facts surrounding these events. My staff have been most willing to sign statutory declarations that they too had no role in such facilitation. When one looks at the examples provided, it is clear that the format is different from that which is used by my office. The senator flatters himself to think that I or my staff would spend that much time in reformatting and retyping the entire mailing list for such a purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like many other people around Australia, I was sent a copy of the sheet detailing the tragic events. I have also been provided with envelopes containing mistakes identical to another colleague's mailing list. I do not for one moment suggest that that person is responsible for the distribution, but mention it to demonstrate further the preposterous nature of the allegations made specifically against me and my colleague the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Stirling will respond for himself when he has an opportunity. However, I believe it suffices to say that the often repeated allegation of the senator about the Australian Federal Police finding incriminating evidence in Mr Cameron's computer has been proven to be incorrect according to none other than the police themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, I would like to make reference to the ferocious allegations made against the Hon. Ian Viner QC that he too had betrayed the senator's estranged wife in his capacity as her lawyer. It needs to be put on the record that Mr Viner did not act as Mrs Crichton-Browne's lawyer but referred her to a lawyer in her desperate time of need. It should also be put on the record that the sheet containing the details of the senator's domestic violence had been circulated before Mr Viner gained access to a copy of the restraining order, and he did so only after the senator both protested his innocence and accused Mr Viner of lying about the existence of such an order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other colleagues, state and federal, former colleagues, party members and staff who are subject to gross abuse in the said document, which has now been incorporated. I know that the senator has a long, deep and abiding loathing of a number of those mentioned. There needs to be no other explanation of his accusations against them than</PARA>
<PARA>just that. I could provide much more evidence of the whole sordid affair, but I will continue to resist that temptation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to state that I find this whole saga so unnecessary and unsavoury, as I have found the years of personal persecution that I have had to endure. However, I did need to place on the public record the truth. Sadly, the senator's performance has been the best possible display I have ever seen of pseudologia fantastica. I rest my case. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Is it a fact that, although the Australian Executive Service Overseas Program Ltd (AESOP) obtains over 99 per cent of its funds for its overseas aid program from the Commonwealth, the terms of the grant agreement with AusAID preclude the Commonwealth from obtaining information about salaries paid to AESOP staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Do AESOP's financial statements disclose that the managing director's remuneration in the 1994-95 financial year amounted to $137,873.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) What redress does the Commonwealth have against the board of a non-Government organisation that apparently allows such a high level of remuneration to be acquired by its employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Is the Minister aware of the claim by a former director of the AESOP Board that the full board never authorised the remuneration paid to its managing director and furthermore was never aware of its extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) What records exist within AESOP that provide authority for the remuneration that has been acquired by its managing director.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Did independent auditors recommend in April 1995 that the board should investigate whether any amounts received in the 1993-94 financial year by the managing director in excess of the remuneration incorrectly stated in the financial statements, approximately $22,000 less than the actual amount, were properly authorised, and that any unauthorised payments be refunded to AESOP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Has that investigation been carried out; if so, what was the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Will the Minister seek the co-operation of AESOP's chairman in ascertaining whether the managing director's present remuneration package still contains, as it did in the 1994 financial year, a salary component of $95,000, employer superannuation contribution of $13,520, employer health insurance contribution of $1,400, provision for spouse airfare for an overseas trip, fully maintained motor vehicle and other benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Did independent auditors report in April 1995 that, of the approximately $146,000 paid by the managing director to himself as travel advances and travel expenses in a little over three years, some $15,000 had not been properly acquitted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) Did the independent auditors report that, in breach of the grant agreement, AESOP had not repaid the unexpended part of its grant each year and that the outstanding amount, between $145,000 and $273,578, should be repaid to AusAID, or alternatively, the grant agreement amended.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. AESOP was established on private sector lines to provide volunteer services mainly to the private sector. A clause in the Agreement precludes access to personal material about individuals and commercial information obtained from clients on a confidential basis. Both types of information are normally kept confidential by commercial companies. However, the AESOP Board does consult AusAID over key decisions and the annual Financial Statement reports expenditure on the Managing Director's salary package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The financial statement disclosed a salary package of $137,873. This included $12,023 for fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) AusAID has no formal legal redress as AESOP is registered under the Companies Act as an independent company. AusAID is represented on the Board, but the Board is responsible to the company under Corporations Law and not the Government. However, the continuing funding of AESOP is subject to an annual allocation of funding approved by the Minister for Development Cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am advised by AESOP that negotiation of the Managing Director's remuneration was previously delegated by the Board to its Finance Sub-committee which reported back to the Board when negotiations had been completed. This practice has been altered in 1995. Remuneration conditions for the Managing Director are now agreed by the full Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I am advised by AESOP that the Finance Committee maintained minute books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Yes. The AESOP Board has advised that there were no unauthorised payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) AusAID has consulted the AESOP Chairman, who has advised that the recommendations of an independent salary review by Coopers and Lybrand have been implemented. The review recommended a salary equivalent to Band 1 of the APS SES (ie in the order of $100,000). None of the non-salary components referred to in the question apply in the new package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The independent auditors report stated that "since 1 July 1991 approximately $146,000 has been paid to Mr Cheatley in the form of reimbursement of expenses or cash advances, of which an approximate amount of $15,000 has not been properly acquitted " (p.12).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Yes. The Chairman of the AESOP Board has advised that the Board received a report from the Managing Director advising of the missing documentation and the steps taken to improve security. As there was a time gap between the document loss and the Board being advised it was considered no benefit would result from Police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) The AESOP Board has advised that: there were no unacquitted cash advances for travel; the Managing Director's travel had been approved in advance; his travel expenses had been "signed off" by the Treasurer in the course of normal quarterly reporting procedures; and, to the Treasurer's best recollections, the documentation now missing had been made available to him. The Board noted that Coopers and Lybrand had audited the previous year's acquittals and found appropriate documentation. Procedures have been implemented to ensure greater control over accounting for cash advances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) Positive discussions have taken place between AusAID and AESOP on this issue. A number of complicated accounting issues are involved. The issue will be finalised in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) The independent auditors report noted payment of an out of court cash settlement. The report provided the following options:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) The issue has been discussed between AusAID and AESOP. AusAID has accepted AESOP's view that recruitment and dismissal costs are standard operational costs for business and that they should be treated as recurrent costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) AusAID is currently reviewing the standard Grant Agreement on the basis of legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. When this review is completed it will be used as a basis for renegotiating agreements with all NGOs and volunteer organisations currently funded by AusAID, including AESOP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) The Chairman of the AESOP Board has advised that the Board has carried out the first stage of a review of the terms and conditions for overseas representatives of AESOP. The Board is conscious of the relatively high cost of its operation in Thailand and is evaluating the merits of continuing present arrangements. Further consideration was to be given at the Board meeting on 10 November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) Refer to response to question (19).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) Subject to any legal considerations, the audit report will be made available to the public together with the report of the follow-up audit by BDO. The follow-up audit is expected to commence shortly to examine AESOP's response to and implementation of each of the recommendations contained in the audit report dated 24 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) Members of the AESOP Board are typically senior, experienced business people from the private sector, who are nominated by major companies supporting AESOP. The Chairman of the AESOP Board has advised that advice on the duties of company directors has not therefore been considered necessary. AusAID has suggested that the Board might consider providing some form of advice on their duties and responsibilities.</PARA>
