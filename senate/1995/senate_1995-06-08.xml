<PARA>I am pleased to table this report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee on accountability in Commonwealth-state funding arrangements in education. The Commonwealth has become increasingly involved in school education since 1960. The states do retain primary responsibility for school education services but the Commonwealth is now a significant player and is encouraging more of a national approach to education across all sectors. With the Commonwealth contribution totalling now around 20 per cent of total public expenditure on schools, accountability is a significant issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has felt somewhat frustrated in its attempt to get a clear picture of exactly where Commonwealth money is spent and to what effect. This is partially the result of a lack of data but more particularly it is the result of an absence of any coherent published documentation of data which enables an easy tracking of what happens to the Commonwealth dollar and how different states expend their education funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability is not just about where the dollar went but about what is actually being achieved. The available data relates almost exclusively to inputs to our education system, with almost nothing about outputs. Even retention rates in schools, which are touted as measurements of outcome, are input measures. The committee believes that there is an urgent need not necessarily for more data but for a rethinking of the kinds of data we need and the way we present it to make more transparent the activities which the data is supposed to represent. Documents such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National report on schooling</EMPHASIS> move some way in this direction, but it remains largely an input driven document and often does not report data in a sufficiently disaggregated way to convey meaningful information, nor does it facilitate useful and important comparisons between states and, more importantly, regions or particular groups within the student population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability is time consuming and it is important to strike the correct balance between the demands we place on those who receive Commonwealth money and the amount of money involved. For example, the Commonwealth national equity programs represent a very small proportion of Commonwealth outlay, yet they have quite sophisticated accountability mechanisms, many of which are exercised at the local and school level. On the other hand, state systems receive large recurrent grants from the Commonwealth and are not expected to enter a comparable accountability relationship for those large sums of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have sought to balance things out by proposing clear requirements between the Commonwealth and states concerning specific-purpose payments and encouraging small grant programs to be managed in line with best practice guides produced by the Auditor-General. Education outcomes lie at the heart of true accountability to our community for the public funds which are expended on school education. It is imperative that education outcomes are described in meaningful ways which properly reflect the many important things which we want our schools to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is concerned that the present COAG-sponsored Industry Commission exercise on performance indicators, which is still largely drawing upon input measures, may produce performance indicators for education which prove quite unhelpful, and probably quite damaging, when it comes to planning for and funding school education and assessing schools' educational effectiveness. We have recommended that the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs establish a project of national significance involving all of the key players in the school area&mdash;both professional and community&mdash;to develop well thought-out, meaningful and relevant outcome measures which serve both state and national needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also looked at the Commonwealth-state relationship in the area of post-compulsory schooling, particularly in the area of vocational education and training. States must provide for this aspect of schooling as a legitimate and necessary part of the school curriculum and each state's educative responsibilities. Schools need access to the Australian National Training Authority growth funds if they are to provide for students the pathways to TAFE and other vocational destinations. Vocational pathways lag severely behind the clearly established academic pathway to university education. We have made some recommendations which should strengthen the place of schools and state training profiles and improve the quality of vocational education available in the post-compulsory years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also considered the problem of alleged substitution of Commonwealth moneys for state, but it proved exceedingly difficult to judge the validity of those claims. This highlights the lack of transparency in existing accountability mechanisms and suggests that a horizontal accountability at the local level is a more appropriate way of ensuring that funds are spent according to their proper purpose. It is simply not possible to track such expenditure through various departments and tiers of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made some recommendations concerning the criteria for the establishment of new schools. We note that the government has instituted a review of the new schools policy, and we support that move. However, we thought it important to place on the record the views of those who came before the committee. I expect that these views and the recommendations which flow from them will be taken into account by the government's review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other recommendations which we hope will assist both the state and Commonwealth education authorities, as well as the students they serve. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee is important insofar as it deals with an issue of great concern to a whole generation of Australians. If we look we will see that there are some three million students involved in Australian schooling today&mdash;three million Australians whose aspirations and expectations of a strong and vibrant understanding and capacity to contribute to our country depend very largely upon the level of support that is provided in their educational years by governments in this country. What we have seen in recent times right across Australia is governments cutting back their commitment to education. On the other hand, we have seen that the Commonwealth contribution has grown substantially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report arose out of growing concerns about the way in which state education has been administered across this country. It comes at a time when vast numbers of teachers are being sacked by state authorities, where class sizes have risen dramatically, where retention rates have declined and where teachers in many states are involved in quite bitter industrial action. We have seen a marked deterioration in the level of educational provision across this nation. We have seen state governments undertake actions which are completely contrary to the national goals and programs that this parliament has sought to establish. A submission from the Australian Education Union stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The education needs of those currently at school and in their pre-school years are greater than any previous generation for a variety of economic, social and cultural reasons. At the same time they are growing up in an environment which is becoming more and more miserly in its attitude to the provision of education.</PARA>
<PARA>This report also comes at a time when, in spite of the tight budgetary environment, the Commonwealth is spending unprecedented sums of money&mdash;over $3 billion across the nation. The Commonwealth is prepared to take a leading role in ensuring education is provided on a basis of supplementing state efforts. More and more that need is being demonstrated. The Commonwealth's role, as we understood it, is far from being complete and, in terms of accountability mechanisms, it is quite apparent that it is extremely difficult to trace how those Commonwealth dollars are being spent and how adequately they are being spent in terms of the guidelines that they are provided on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extraordinary contrast with the sorts of programs the national Labor government has undertaken. We saw just two days ago the programs announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in terms of the school based citizenship program. We have seen the Commonwealth provide some $25 million in educational programs to provide a higher level of understanding of citizenship responsibilities. We have seen educational institutions adopt a series of information programs such as the quality education program, the early literacy program, the gifted and talented student program, the LOTE program and a wide variety of other nationally based initiatives which are in sharp contrast to the way in which the states are operating. So the Commonwealth is providing leadership in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disturbing that this inquiry was not really able to establish how those funds were being spent and, in the broadest terms, to demonstrate whether or not the accountability mechanisms were being followed. Our view, and my view particularly, was that it is important that there be an improvement in the accountability mechanisms. Again, the Education Union's submission to the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEU believes the Commonwealth is entitled to expect the high level of goodwill towards its initiatives, based on a common concern for the quality of teaching, learning and social justice by all involved in the education process. This is not always forthcoming from State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>If we look at specific areas, we can see that there are quite considerable gaps in the way in which Commonwealth funding arrangements have been entered into, specifically with regard to specific purpose payments. We could look at the question of professional development of teachers. We can see where the increasing Commonwealth contribution has not been matched by the states and where the Commonwealth contribution in some areas now constitutes almost 100 per cent of the effort in terms of teacher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report talks about the need to measure outcomes not just on the basis of the `Let's give the kids a quiz' approach adopted in some states, particularly in my own of Victoria. Through the COAG exercises on performance indicators we have seen that the approach taken by state educational authorities is totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand that, in vocational education, the Commonwealth now is almost alone in providing the growth funds for vocational education. Yet the states remain static and, in administrative arrangements, in total control. So, while the Commonwealth accepts greater and greater financial responsibility for education in this country, it has been unable to ensure adequate administrative and accountability mechanisms to protect that investment in Australia's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard the so-called new schools policy, there is a minority report from the Labor senators on this committee which goes to the current review by the minister of that policy. This policy is the vehicle by which funding arrangements are entered into to protect the various public and private sector relationships in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned that proposals in the report for changes to the minimum school size and locality requirements in the establishment of new private schools would effectively undermine the viability of the state education system. That concern was also expressed by the Catholic Education Commission in its submission to the committee which indicated its commitment to maintaining the viability of the state education system in this country. </PARA>

It is Jeff Kennett that sacked 6,000 teachers and saw the removal of 9,000 students and the closure of 300 schools. If you want to talk about education policies, talk about Jeff Kennett and the way in which he has destroyed the education system in Victoria. That policy has now been followed in Tasmania and South Australia. It is the sort of reckless abandon which the education institutions have followed under Liberal leadership in the states, undermining national programs, undermining commitment to national objectives and undermining the future of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when we talk about Commonwealth contributions to education and accountability, we should also talk about the way conservative governments have destroyed the education system in this country in such a short time. Why do they do that? It is an ideological commitment to and an ideological hatred of the public sector. That is reflected in the dramatic decline in the percentage of outlays by conservative state governments. As a priority education don't rate with the conservatives. Education don't rate in Victoria. Education as a percentage of state outlays has dramatically dropped. But you want to put money into racing, into your friends on the grand prix or the casinos and your Liberal Party treasurers and their connections with the business community.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this amendment is to reduce Government outlays by limiting rebate eligibility to diesel fuel used for residential premises on agricultural properties and in mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been mindful that the removal of rebate eligibility for this category may present an additional financial burden on the operation of farming properties and on individuals engaging in mining operations. For these reasons, rebate will continue to be paid on diesel fuel purchased for use for domestic purposes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">at residential premises on the farms of individuals engaging in agriculture; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">at residential premises of individuals engaging in mining operations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In proposing this amendment, the Government has also been mindful of the adverse effects the abolition of this category would have on indigenous communities in Australia. As a result, separate compensation arrangements in the order of $1.8 million per year will be put in place to ensure that indigenous communities are not disadvantaged by the change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed abolition of the category of `residential premises' and the introduction of the new and related categories under `agriculture' and `mining operations' in items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 of Schedule 1 to the bill are proposed to have effect in respect of diesel fuel purchased on or after 1 July 1995. Diesel fuel purchased before 1 July 1995 will continue to be rebateable under the current legislative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recurring savings as a result of these measures are in the order of $11.8 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 3 amendments proposed by the bill are intended to clarify the ambit and integrity of the Scheme as it was introduced in 1982. The Government is firmly of the view that the Scheme was never intended to pay rebate on diesel fuel used in activities that might only loosely be described as encouraging mining operations or primary production in a general sense. Rather, in the Government's view, the Scheme was designed to pay rebate to primary producers who use diesel fuel in the act of growing and gathering in of crops, or the rearing of livestock, and in other activities that are sufficiently connected with agriculture or, in relation to mining operations, to pay rebate for fuel used in the act of exploring or prospecting for minerals, and their subsequent mining and beneficiation, or in the liquefaction of natural gas or the production of common salt. The series of 3 amendments described below proceed on that basis, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(II)Confirming the scope of the definition of `agriculture'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, an appeal was heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a decision of the Australian Customs Service to refuse the payment of rebate on diesel fuel used to carry out `amenity agriculture', such as the mowing of lawns and sports grounds and the maintenance of golf courses. In September 1994, the Tribunal decided that the decision of Customs to not pay rebate was correct, but the matter is currently on appeal to the Federal Court. Items 4 and 10 of Schedule 1 to the bill are proposed to remove any doubt that these kinds of activities are intended to fall outside of the act's definition of `agriculture', and thus are not to be given the benefit of rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These particular amendments will ensure the continuation of rebate payments for diesel fuel used in carrying out agricultural activities for the purposes of a business undertaken to obtain produce for sale. At the same time, they will ensure that amenity agriculture of the type carried out by Local/State Governments, parks and gardens organisations and sporting clubs and individuals is excluded from the definition of `agriculture' in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because these issues have arisen as a result of efforts by users of diesel fuel to broaden the scope of the Scheme well beyond what the Government believes was intended, the Government is proposing that this amendment be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue. It is from this date that purchases of diesel fuel made after that date can be claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without such retrospectivity, there is a likelihood that claims which are pending the outcome of a Federal Court appeal will result in the payment of rebate of up to $40 million. In addition, recurring savings in the order of $15 million per year are anticipated from this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(III)Narrowing the definition of `minerals'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until recently, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court have held the view that the term `mining for minerals' in the act's definition of `mining operations' introduced a purposive test requiring a rebate claimant to demonstrate that the purpose of the claimant's operations was to obtain a mineral or minerals embedded in the material that was extracted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, there was a clear distinction between the extraction of sand per se and the extraction of sand with a view to obtaining from it minerals such as rutile, zircon or almandite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meaning of `mining operations' was therefore considered to be reasonably well settled until a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the issue of extracting sand for use in the making of concrete or for use as bedding sand in the construction industry. The Tribunal decided that the extraction of such sand was eligible for rebate. Claims have also been received for rebate on diesel fuel used in the pumping of ground water to be supplied as drinking water to towns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are, in the Government's view, uses well beyond the intent of the Scheme, which was and is to deliver an assistance measure to mainstream mining pursuits. Accordingly, in item 7 of Schedule 1 to the bill, the Government has proposed to amend the definition of `minerals' to exclude sand, sandstone, earth, soil, slate, clay (other than bentonite or kaolin), basalt, granite, gravel, limestone or water. The exclusion is consistent with the principal mining legislation of the States and would bring about a transparent distinction between mining for minerals and operations that cannot, in the ordinary sense, be regarded as mining. Where these materials are extracted for the purpose of recovering a mineral, the extraction will remain eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proposing that this amendment be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue. Without such retrospectivity, there is a likelihood that the claim which is pending the outcome of a Federal Court appeal will result in the payment of rebate of up to $16 million. In addition, recurring savings in the order of $5 million are anticipated from this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(IV)the amendment of the definitions of `agriculture' and `mining operations' to specify a clear list of activities in which the use of diesel fuel is to be eligible for the payment of rebate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the existing legislation, both the definition of `agriculture' and the definition of `mining operations' employ what are known as `sweeper clauses', which have the effect of making other operations connected with agriculture or mining eligible for the payment of rebate. The interpretation of these `sweeper clauses' has been a main source of contention over the years, and has generated most of the litigation in the lifetime of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in Items 4 and 8 of Schedule 1 to the bill are to remove the subjectivity associated with the `sweeper clauses', and replace those clauses with an objective list of activities that are eligible for rebate. This has been done with a view to giving claimants certainty as to the actual activities that are eligible for rebate, and thereby avoiding the costly litigation concerning eligibility circumstances which has plagued the Scheme in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that although the proposed amendments will necessarily narrow the range of activities for which rebate is payable, farmers and miners will generally be unaffected. The intention of these amendments is to put beyond doubt that the Scheme is not meant to provide rebate eligibility for activities which are not sufficiently connected with mining or agriculture; for instance, the provision of a service or utility to a farmer or miner, such as electricity through a grid, or the building of a dam which is intended to supply water to, amongst others, farmers, or the operation of a garbage tip on a former mine site by someone other than the miner, where the resultant filling of the mine site is said to be the rehabilitation of a mine site, and thus connected with a mining operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because claims of these kinds have sought to broaden the Scheme well beyond what it should be, the Government is proposing that these amendments be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue. Without such retrospectivity, there is a likelihood that claims which are pending the outcome of several Federal Court appeals and one High Court application will result in the payment of rebate of up to $30 million. In addition, recurring savings in the order of $7 million are anticipated from these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noted with regard to the 3 proposed series of amendments which I have outlined and which it is proposed have a retrospective commencement, that any rebates that have been paid since 1 August 1986 are to remain intact, and are to be treated as validly paid. This is explicitly stated in Clause 5 of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995, and this is almost a continuing saga that appears, quite frankly, to be never-ending. Maybe this bill will bring about the resolution of this matter that has been going on and on. In fact, when I was looking back at past debates on this issue, I saw that on 6 June 1989 Senator Short brought forth the following subject for debate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to ensure the future of Qantas and Australian Airlines by their sale to the public, as suggested by the Minister for Transport and Communications and supported by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>That was because the opposition took the strong view, as we still do, that privatisation was the only way to get real efficiency and competition and to maximise the resources and assets of the airline. It was not just to raise money, but that is what this government is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no philosophy, no genuine Labor policies, involved in the government's selling Qantas. What is involved is phoneying up the budget figures yet again. The proceeds of the sale of Qantas have been put in the budget figures for the last several years. The sale has not taken place but it makes the budget look prettier, or worse, depending on how you look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy that back in 1989 when the now Treasurer, Mr Willis, and the present Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, along with former Senator Button and former Senator Peter Walsh agreed totally with what the opposition was saying&mdash;that there was a need to privatise Qantas for those particular reasons&mdash;the left wing of the Labor party would not let them do it. That is why, six years later, we are still debating the same issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least now the left wing has realised that because of the need for money, unless the government sells Qantas it will not have enough money to spend on the things that the left wing wants the government to spend money on. As I say, the government has sold out its philosophic position in order to make money and for no other reason. There is no question about it: the government believes, as we do, that there are sound and specific reasons for Qantas, along with some other government business enterprises, being privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As former Senator Bishop, now Mrs Bishop, the honourable member for Mackellar, said in this debate in the other place, the attitude of the government and the opposition to privatisation is an entirely different philosophic one. She said that the first aim of privatising business rests with the ability of the private sector to provide the same goods and services more efficiently and effectively, including allowing for any special objectives for community service obligations. Secondly, it should be used for the reduction of public sector indebtedness. Again and again, those on this side of the chamber have made that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is the expansion of the number of Australians who are investing in Australia. That is absolutely central to our policy on privatisation because in this way we can increase private savings in a vehicle which is different from the government's very narrow vehicle of compulsory superannuation. By privatising Qantas, we allow Australians to participate in the ownership of a company which at present is truly government owned in the sense that the government is the beneficiary, not the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Qantas is the `people's airline', just as the Commonwealth Bank is supposed to be the `people's bank', surely it should be owned directly by the people and not be under the control of the government. We have seen quite clearly that this government is not necessarily the most efficient or competent government in running things. On the contrary, it is quite a disaster. Back on 30 November 1994, in this chamber, Senator Short, when talking about the initial Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1994, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill would never have been necessary if the government had handled the sale of Qantas with even a modicum of administrative ability. It was not just the way it approached the actual sale, but those who were involved in the sale were frustrated at every stage by continual changes in the government's transport policy, particularly in the area of aviation. It was going to sell Australian&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Australian Airlines&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then it was not going to sell Australian. It was going to put Australian with Qantas, then it was not going to put Australian with Qantas. On and on it went, to the great frustration of all those concerned and, in particular, to the great frustration of the process of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also interesting to note that, at that time, Senator Short warned that the arrangements then being made to float off the remaining 75 per cent could not work. In November, he said quite clearly that if there was to remain a 35 per cent maximum limit on the total shares to be held by foreigners, only 10 per cent of the remaining float could be sold to foreign shareholders. A total of 75 per cent was to be sold. Therefore, 65 per cent of it&mdash;about six-sevenths of what was to be floated&mdash;had to go to Australian shareholders, otherwise the foreign ownership provisions of the Qantas Sale Act would be breached. In other words, it has clearly made it impossible for the government to reap its biggest financial reward without altering the arrangement as to this 35 per cent. That is what this bill is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill increases the foreign ownership limit for Qantas from 35 per cent of issued capital to 49 per cent, but restricts foreign airlines to holding no more than a combined 35 per cent of the issued share capital. All we have to say to the government is, `We told you so. You were wrong again. You messed it up again. You just do not know what you are doing.' The government does not know what it is doing because it has no philosophical interest in privatisation. It is simply selling Qantas for the sake of the money. It needs the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is all about money. It is estimated that the government may well get $300 to $350 million more by allowing a greater foreign shareholding than if it stuck by its arrangements of November 1994. In other words, it ain't the principle of the thing; it is the money. That is unfortunately the truth in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has an obsession with money in its preparedness to allow icons to be sold overseas. It is taking a significant role in this case. Under this government, so many Australian icons are now foreign owned. The list is extraordinary. It might be a good idea for the Senate to one day debate the disaster that has befallen Australia because of the lack of adequate savings in Australia that has resulted from appalling government economic policies. As a consequence, there are inadequate levels of savings in Australia to be able to buy not only these government companies that the government wants to boost its budget with by privatising, but also longstanding Australian companies that have now gone overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know about Vegemite and a range of biscuits. Almost all the Australian icons, such as Aeroplane Jelly, have gone to overseas ownership under this government, which has no interest in doing anything to encourage a level of private savings that is necessary to keep Australian companies in Australia. Here we have a government company with 49 per cent of its issued capital having to be sold overseas in order to get a decent return for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was an example or tangible evidence of this government's incompetence in encouraging any kind of decent level of domestic savings, it is shown in this bill. There is an admission that the government cannot sell off Qantas; it cannot raise the money needed unless it allows 49 per cent of the issued capital to end up in foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good the government belatedly saying after 12 years, `We have this new super deluxe superannuation scheme which will force people to save in superannuation funds under the administration, in some instances, of some union officials.' We need incentives for private sector saving. We have to encourage Mr and Mrs Australia to save their money rather than spend it. There are no taxation incentives to do so. On the contrary, there are taxation disincentives against saving. Until we have a reasonable savings ratio in Australia&mdash;as I think Senator Parer pointed out yesterday&mdash;we will find more and more of Australia's icons totally owned, majority owned or significantly owned from overseas. This will be aided and abetted not only by the government's direct sales, like the Qantas sale, where it is handing over 49 per cent of Qantas to foreigners, but also by the indirect impact that the government's negative, ridiculous economic policies are having by encouraging Australian corporations to be owned by foreigners. It is about time that we had a government in Australia which provides incentives to savings so that this bill would not be necessary. This bill is aimed at raising money for the government and, as a result, Qantas has to be sold overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Qantas is already 25 per cent owned by British Airways. I am not critical of that, nor am I critical of the arrangement undertaken which finally has approval by which Qantas and British Airways will have a rationalisation of the kangaroo route to England. It is very depressing that we now have to get rid of another 24 per cent of Qantas to foreign interests&mdash;only another 10 per cent of which can go to foreign airlines. If Australians are not capable and do not have sufficient savings to buy Australia at a price which is reasonable, then it is dramatic evidence of the failure of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not know if we will ever see a situation in which this government will do the right thing. The government has acknowledged its inability to sell Qantas domestically. The sale of Qantas has appeared in every budget for the last five budgets. The government has been including in budgets the receipts of the sale of Qantas, which has never taken place. This phoney filling up of the budget to make it look good, dressing it up and making it cosmetic, will come to an end if this bill involves the sale of Qantas. At least this may well be the last budget in which the same sale has been put over, again as a way of dressing up the budget figures. Hopefully that cosmetic role of Qantas will be turned into a practical role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The sale of Qantas is not opposed by the opposition. In fact, we have been proposing it for quite some time. The reasons we want Qantas privatised are to make it even better. I know technically, in terms of its safety record, you could not make Qantas better. It is first rate, and we recognise that. In terms of its commercial capacity and its ethos of competition, there is no doubt that privatising Qantas will give a potential for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dead hand of government is not the sort of hand that we need in a highly competitive and tough international atmosphere such as international airlines. This privatising proposal is sound. It is just a great shame that the only motivation for this and the only reason the government is now increasing the potential for foreign ownership to 49 per cent is the money, not the principle. That is not a surprise because this government does not have any principles. </PARA>

When my late mother was a young girl she worked in McGilvray's agency office in Cloncurry in the early days of this century.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may have done the right thing by Tasmania by leaving and going up to the better country in the north and north-west of Queensland. The airline has a very close association with north-west Queensland from its formative days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very distressing to see that the Australian public&mdash;the taxpayers&mdash;eventually became the owners of that airline and invested quite a lot of money in it over the years and built up a capital asset. This mob of financial vandals then came along in 1995. What did it do with that asset&mdash;the family silver that had been saved for and built up over so many years? They sold the family silver to pay this week's grocery bill. That is what distresses me so much. If you were selling Qantas, as we on this side have always said we would do, and putting the money back into some capital asset that would make a major contribution, which would be a real investment in Australia's long-term interest, in my view that would be an appropriate and proper use of the proceeds of the privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To simply use the proceeds of those capital assets for this year's budget to get this mob of financial vandals out of their problem in a pre-election year is just a disgrace. It really shows how the Labor Party has thumbed its nose at the Australian people&mdash;those people who have built up those assets and acquired the family silver, the silver candlesticks, over a long period of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party deserves contempt and condemnation for being so without policies, so without management skills, so without anything at all going for it as we approach this election, that it is prepared to sell the family silver just to get a headline budget this year, in the hope of giving itself some possibility of some sort of show in the next election. I think that is a disgrace. It requires condemnation and I am quite confident that, for this reason and for many others, the Australian public will show their disgust in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleagues have said, if you are privatising a capital asset, something that the Australian taxpayer has built up over many decades, that money should be used for very worthwhile long-term purposes. As my colleagues have indicated, most of the proceeds of privatisation should be put to paying off some of the huge borrowings, the huge debt, that this government particularly has incurred in its 12 miserable years in office. That is what we would be doing with a lot of the proceeds of capital assets that we would be privatising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the coalition has announced that some of the proceeds of privatisation would be used by the next coalition government to reinvest in capital infrastructure projects which give a return to the nation. What portion of those moneys would go to that is something that will be announced at the appropriate time. What capital assets we would be investing in is also something that will become clear in the fullness of time, at a time of our choosing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mob of financial vandals have run down Commonwealth investment in public infrastructure projects over the last 12 years. It used to be that about 7.6 per cent of GDP was invested in public infrastructure. Under this government that has fallen to 4.2 per cent of GDP in the 1994 year. That is because it simply finds it easier to spend all of its money on buying votes, often in areas where it is starting to lose votes. It forgets about the capital infrastructure and lets it go by; it does not think there are many votes in that. It does not care about what happens in the future; it lives for today, not caring about the children or the grandchildren and the type of Australia that they will inherit. So our capital infrastructure spending has fallen quite dramatically under the Labor Party. It has been indicated that the coalition will be embarking upon the long-term goal of trying to reverse that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for me to speculate, and I certainly will not, but because we are talking about Qantas and north-western Queensland it brings to mind the enormous need there is in inland Australia for capital infrastructure projects. I attended, a couple of weeks ago in Longreach, which also has an association with the founding days of Qantas, a meeting of the Federal Inland Development Organisation, FIDO, which has as its goal the development of inland Australia. Speaking at that conference was Mr Ernie Bridge, who is a Labor member of the Western Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bridge has some fairly visionary and very long-term&mdash;some might say not yet feasibly proved&mdash;goals for water storage in inland Australia and for turning coastal rivers inland. If my memory serves me correctly, Mr Bridge will be in Sydney tomorrow, Friday, 9 June, announcing the formation of a water strategy foundation or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the Commonwealth should be spending money on that&mdash;that is something that the coalition will be looking at in the fullness of time&mdash;but these are the sorts of visionary projects that these moneys, these capital proceeds, should be considered for. Instead of just spending the money on this year's budget, it is those types of infrastructure projects that deserve some reinvestment of the nation's capital wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit ironic that Qantas started in Longreach, Cloncurry and other parts of inland Australia but now does not even fly to those areas. It still bears the name Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service, but, regrettably, it does not serve Longreach, Mount Isa or any of those western areas. I appreciate that a private company, or even a corporatised government company, has to look at its bottom line and cannot always service every area. But, in some cases, I think there is a case for community service obligation assistance from the government. I simply mention in this context that the people of Mount Isa, Longreach and those areas of western Queensland are pretty poorly served by airline services at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the debate any more, but I again emphasise that privatisation is&mdash;as my colleagues have quite properly pointed out&mdash;the right way to go. It is something that the coalition has been calling for for some time, because we see no purpose in governments getting involved in business enterprises&mdash;governments are there to govern; business is there to run business enterprises. We have always been of that view. But, having had that capital asset built up by the taxpayers, it distresses me and many Australians that the capital proceeds are simply being squandered on balancing this year's budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995. The list of speakers contained five names; it has now blown out to nine. Obviously, coalition speakers have had a chance to consider the issue and several of them have entered the lists beyond what was posted. I do not wish to suggest that this a filibuster, but there is a quite unexpected sudden interest from the benches opposite in this bill. The government welcomes all interest in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate in this chamber has ranged far and wide. It has been about the principles and desirability of privatising in general, as a concept, and about the history, through Liberal Party eyes, of the privatisation debate in the Labor Party. It has ranged as a proxy for foreign ownership issues generally. Senator Kernot addressed us on issues related to the print media inquiry. Last evening, it even got to the stage in which the memoirs of a failed Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, got trotted out from the Liberal Party side in an effort to bolster a debating point. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am saying that the title of his book is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Confessions of a Failed Finance Minister</EMPHASIS>. He happens to be a friend of mine; in no way do I regard him as failed. But that is the bar he placed on his career and the judgment he makes&mdash;I think somewhat ironically. All I am saying is that references in his book were trotted out to bolster a point. This debate has not concentrated on the bill directly but, as second reading debates often do, ranged widely. Opposition senators have said, `Of course we support the legislation, but the government has bungled the application of it.' That is their words and judgment, not ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary the outcome of this debate is that the coalition, as I understand from Senator Parer, who is leading on behalf of the coalition, will support the passage of this legislation. I am not entirely clear about the position of the Australian Democrats, represented by Senator Kernot. I thought they were wavering in their support for the legislation, but that is not certain. The Greens are opposed to the legislation. That was made clear by Senator Margetts. In summary, the bill will pass and will pass with a number of observations having been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in replying to the debate, I simply wish to reiterate a number of points and perhaps pick up one or two things said in the debate by honourable senators opposite. The first point is that it is the government's view that Australia should have a national airline and that that national airline should be our flag carrier. The view the government takes, though, is that the airline does not need to be in public ownership to achieve that. We recognise that Qantas is, and quite rightly justifiably by every test, an icon in Australia and that that status should be preserved. This bill will continue to ensure that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will provide that there is a majority of Australian ownership, Australian citizens or Australian companies owning this airline; that the name of Qantas will be preserved; that the headquarters for this airline will be located in Australia; that two-thirds of the board that runs this airline will be Australian citizens; and that the chairman of the board will be an Australian. This bill provides that foreigners can own up to 49 per cent of the airline but no more than that. The government's second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the Government proposes in this bill to increase the overall foreign ownership limit for Qantas from 35 to 49 per cent and to restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than 25 per cent individually and 35 per cent in total of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a foreign airline can hold no more than 25 per cent of the show and foreign airlines can hold no more than 35 per cent of the show. The national interest provisions of the Qantas Sale Act would remain unchanged as would the existing 25 per cent limit on individual holdings of foreigners. The bill, therefore, preserves Australian ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fair bit of debate has been devoted to the timing of this and references to the sale of Qantas in previous budgets. I do not propose to go blow by blow on all of those allegations that have been made&mdash;they are too numerous&mdash;other than to comment in answer to that general body of argument. It is the government's view, and we believe a widely publicly supported view, that once you have made a decision to provide for private ownership of an airline such as Qantas, a major national asset, the return on that sale should be at the optimum level. We ought not sell it at bargain basement prices; we should get premium prices for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So timing in terms of the sale is related to the state of the market&mdash;a judgement about when market opportunity is at its optimum so that the sale of the airline will attract the best possible price and Australian taxpayers will get the best possible return for their assets. It is for those reasons that the timing of this bill is now and that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), who is in charge of this process, has said that the sale of the next tranche will take place some time between mid-May and mid-July. It is appropriate that on this day, 8 June, we should decide this matter. In terms of the timing argument, while a lot of sport has been had by the opposition about this issue, the government's position is that timing is important, and important in order to see that the Australian taxpayer gets the best possible return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other issues raised in the debate concerned the matter of what will be the provisions for employee participation in the ownership of this airline. Perhaps I should say one or two words about that. The government has indicated its support for the introduction of an employee ownership plan at the time of the float consistent with its broader commitment to employee involvement in businesses. We have that general commitment. Planning for the Qantas public share offer is proceeding on the basis that the offer will allow for an appropriate level of equity participation by employees based on a fair and equitable employee share ownership scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas has developed such a scheme which was incorporated in Qantas's enterprise bargaining agreement certified by the Industrial Relations Commission in December last year. The scheme is based on the provisions of the current Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and involves the issue of free shares worth $500 for all employees at the time of the float, with further free shares worth $500 about a year later, subject to Qantas meeting certain performance targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the enterprise agreement provides that up to five per cent of the shares issued in the float will be made available in a priority offer to all staff at market prices. And, in addition to planning the Qantas public share offer to include an appropriate level of employee participation, the government will also be endeavouring to give value to buyers and to maximise the return to taxpayers from the Commonwealth's remaining 75 per cent ownership stake while at the same time taking into account the rights of the other existing shareholder, British Airways, as established under the trade sale agreement. It will also be necessary to comply with the Australian Stock Exchange requirements for listed companies. So there will be provision for employee participation and free provision of shares to employees and a preservation of part of the offer for employees to purchase shares off their own bat at market prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before voting on the second reading and moving to the committee stage, we have an amendment to the second reading from Senator Kernot of the Australian Democrats. It has been circulated in the chamber. The government does not support this amendment, not because it is critical of us but because we do not believe that it is an appropriate amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the amendment refers to something not related to this bill, the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media. This is the Qantas bill. The Fairfax inquiry or whatever we call it&mdash;</PARA>

But it would seem to me that if we go down that track&mdash;and I understand the reason for the increase in foreign equity is to broaden the market&mdash;it may well send the wrong signals to some of the potential foreign investors overseas which may in turn affect the price of Qantas shares. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will deal with part (a) of the amendment first. Both the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) and Senator Parer said that it is not related, but that is a very convenient argument. The fact of the matter is that the Foreign Investment Review Board is the link. We are talking about foreign investment applications which come before the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Senate committee looked at print media, and that is true in a specific instance, but it looked at the whole operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board and its role in processing applications&mdash;not just for media, but applications generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The second point I make is that coalition members of that select committee, even given that they have different views on how strict a foreign investment policy ought to be, were unanimous in their views, as were government members, on the need for reform of the Foreign Investment Review Board. We are about to embark upon the sale of another very important asset. It is not a matter of whether or not there can be a certain percentage of foreign investment; it is a matter of who is making the bids and whether a particular bid is contrary to the national interest or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, made a big deal about the national interest in his so-called headland speech on Tuesday night. I am very surprised that the opposition would think that there could be no circumstances in this Qantas bid where the FIRB might have to take the national interest into consideration. I think it is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook explained technically why the government has not yet responded. We all know that there was a lot of toing-and-froing about what constituted the major report and the final report of that committee, and we all know that the actual body of recommendations made by the committee has been in existence for over a year now and that the government has had plenty of opportunities to address those recommendations and to have a draft response ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am very disappointed. I can understand the government's reluctance, but I am very disappointed and surprised that the opposition cannot see fit to support this particular amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask the minister a couple of questions about the matters he raised during his speech regarding the availability of a share scheme for employees of Qantas. First, how many Qantas employees would be interested in participating in this scheme? If it is five per cent of the number of shares which are on offer, my calculations show me that it is something like 37.5 million shares. That would equate to roughly $100 million, I guess, if you took the price that was quoted of about $2.66 per share. Second, I just wondered, if that is the case, whether there are enough Qantas employees willing to take up the share offer that has been proposed at five per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that there are approximately 27,000 Qantas employees&mdash;it is a big work force. The second part of your question is: are there enough and will they take it up? That is to be seen, I think. I understand that there is a great deal of interest among Qantas employees in grabbing a slice of the action in the airline, and the expectation is that a number of them will move to take up the offer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out yesterday in a speech I made on privatisation, the workers at the Tilbury docks took up shares at #1 each and they are now worth something like #7, and that was over a period of 18 months. So, certainly, it would be a great thing for Qantas employees, being so proud of the airline, to be able to participate in that share float. I was just interested to know how many there were. I did not realise there were so many employees&mdash;27,000. Then again, you have to remember that Qantas now takes in all the domestic carriers. Even so, 27,000 employees would still have to find a fair amount to make up $100 million. I just wonder whether they will be taking out overdrafts on their bank accounts to buy shares.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to follow up on that point with respect to the 27,000 employees. Under the enterprise agreement reached in Qantas, that means that, on the basis of your explanation in the second reading debate, staff or employees of Qantas would be given an initial $500 worth of shares, followed up by another $500 worth within 12 months under certain conditions. That, in itself, at 27,000 employees, means $27 million out of the float. Is that correct?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Qantas has an enviable international reputation, one that every Australian can be proud of. As a consequence, there is a great deal of interest among foreigners and other airlines in participating in the float. Going back to the foundation principle&mdash;that after a decision to sell a public asset has been made, the next question is how to get the best price for it&mdash;the government had two considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, that Qantas should remain majority Australian owned, which the 49 per cent provision ensures. Secondly, on the question of getting the best price in the market and getting international interest in Qantas, the judgement we have made is that there is strong interest from many international investment houses and other airlines, and that that will encourage stronger domestic interest. Both factors working together should ensure the desirable outcome, from a taxpayer point of view, that the best price is obtained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would be speculative. I do not know and I am not sure I can answer. I will check this answer in half a tick but I do not think I can answer in any case because, as you would know, we would not be saying publicly what we thought the global amount was that the float might bring. That is for the reason that, often, if you do reveal those figures, telling people what your price is, you will either get just that or less than that. I think it is in the public interest here not to disclose that figure. Certainly, we have a figure in mind but we would try to do better than that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite obviously, the reason for the increase was to broaden the market. Does that not indicate that the market here is too narrow and this reflects the lack of domestic savings available to take up Qantas? I think everyone in the community would like to see all Australians owning Qantas. The necessity to expand that market and to allow foreign investment in order to maximise the price&mdash;to which I do not object&mdash;is simply because we have among the lowest domestic savings in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

That debate's time will come in this chamber but I do not want to engage in it now, so I decline that implicit offer. However, I do say that, even if you had the view that you have just expressed, you would also have to agree that if we get stronger domestic participation people will be drawing on their savings and will meet that.

As Senator Cook would be aware, places like Cairns, which are out-of-the-way tourist destinations but which depend heavily on domestic trade as well as international, have enjoyed to date some fairly good service from Qantas. One of my concerns is that if a large stake were taken in Qantas by a foreign airline, that foreign airline may choose, for its own reasons to do with its own international routes rather than the volume of domestic traffic, to cut back on the domestic services between, say, Sydney and Cairns, Brisbane and Cairns or elsewhere. What consideration has the government given to this matter? What guarantee do tourism operators in Cairns or elsewhere in North Queensland have that services will not be cut back if a large stake in the airline is taken by a foreign airline, which, of course, has a different agenda?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The limit on a single foreign airline under this bill in terms of Qantas ownership, as you will appreciate, is 25 per cent. No single foreign airline can own more than 25 per cent of Qantas. One foreign airline, British Airways, owns that now and I do not imagine that it would wish to surrender that. Therefore, the scope for further foreign airline ownership, which can be up to 35 per cent, is the remaining 10 per cent. I think there are prudential limits on what foreign airlines, with other agendas, might have in directing the operations of Qantas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the trade sale part of the Qantas privatisation, when we sold 25 per cent to British Airways, certainly, in the discussions that I was privy to, there was some concern that we sell it to an airline which has got a congruent type of agenda to Qantas's; not to an airline that might want to buy a stake in order to close the show down and grow its own airline to replace it. With British Airways, we are strongly of the view that its agenda is consistent with ours in this. </PARA>

All the projections of the Cairns Port Authority, which owns the airport in Cairns, are for strong and continuing tourist growth. The airlines fly there if their customers want to go there and on every test, I think, that will improve and increase in Cairns, rather than diminish. I do not expect that there is any need for a community service obligation to direct the airlines to fly to Cairns.

The airline system in Australia is competitive, and I believe that competition will ensure that service, price and frequency are key elements to ensuring the slice of the market that airlines need to deploy their fleets most effectively.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In contributing to the resumption of the second reading debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, there are a number of points that I wish to raise. Honourable members and senators may well remember that this bill started off seeking to amend the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as a consequence of some suggestions put forward by a working party to review the operation of the commission. I do not think there was any dissent resulting from the proposed changes to be made in that respect. I think that was some time last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the bill being dealt with, the Brandy decision was handed down by the High Court, throwing into complete chaos the government's then still to be considered new arrangements with respect to HREOC. I think the bill was postponed so that some further amendments could be tacked on to it to try to, at least in the short term, remedy the problem that was created by the Brandy decision. Others would say that it was the problem that was resolved by the Brandy decision. Nonetheless, it did create a problem for the existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was that the government&mdash;as I understand its views&mdash;wanted to find a way to make it cheaper and easier for people to resolve human rights concerns that were taken to the commission and that it was seen as very expensive to go to  conciliation, to have that not work, to then have some sort of hearing with a determination, to have that ignored and to then go off to the High Court. The cost of two hearings was ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple answer to that should have been seen and was, in fact, presented by Senator O'Chee and myself&mdash;it is so long ago I cannot remember whether it was Senator Kemp then; it may well have been&mdash;who basically said, `Why don't you just recognise that the commission was originally set up to, and should, take on the role of an educator, facilitator and conciliator. But it is not a court and it is never going to be one. You can't just will it into being a court; you've got to turn it into one if you want it to be able to make binding decisions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was not happy to take the suggestion that we put forward when this matter went to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Our suggestion was this: keep the commission; people go there with their problems to see whether they can get a conciliation. But if they cannot conciliate the matter&mdash;in other words, once you have got to the point where you absolutely know the parties cannot agree&mdash;then send it straight off to the Federal Court. That is a pretty simple solution; it is a very pragmatic approach to resolving the difficulties of the costs of two hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, however, was not happy with that and decided to say, `We'll have hearings in the commission and you'll be able to register them as though, in a sense, they were a decision of the court.' That is where it all came unstuck because you cannot, just by legislative fiat, work out a mechanism to make a decision of a body that is not a court binding as though it were made by a court&mdash;and that is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response has been to simply turn the commission back to what it was before that legislation was passed in, I think, 1992. We are not unhappy with that because, obviously, you could not allow the situation as it was to continue. Something had to be done. The commission was working reasonably well in respect of that aspect, at least, up until that time. So we support the amendments that will now put the commission back to the 1992, I think it is, position and we will see what comes from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We just highlight two points: firstly, we suggested a better way to go that would have saved the government from getting into this mess, costing itself and numerous other people plenty of money, and the government simply refused to listen; and, secondly, just because we are now back where we were, it does not mean everything is fixed. We still want to know how this matter is going to be resolved in the long term, because the government has clearly indicated that this is not the long-term resolution of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another classic example of a government getting an idea and being warned at the time&mdash;and that was the second time that we warned it that we thought this would be unconstitutional. The government said it had the best advice in the world that this would stand up to any challenge. On that basis we said, `We are doubtful but we'll support you.' And look what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, we put all that aside. We now want to know: what are you going to do? The warnings as to the unconstitutionality of this were made when the amendments were passed in 1992 and we are now in 1995. The government has had plenty of time to consider a suitable mechanism to put in place should it lose in the High Court, as it has. The government has had plenty of time. So it set up some sort of review and got a few people looking at it; but they have not been able to come to a decision, as best I understand, yet. I think they have some proposals and, if they have not subsequently made a decision, they are very close but they are not there. We do not have a public document that we can put out and discuss with a whole range of people as to what the government wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we are in the latter part of the winter sittings in 1995 going back to where we were in 1992 because we have a government that refused to listen at the time as to unconstitutionality, refused to listen at the time as to an alternative means of giving a cheaper and more efficient resolution of these matters. We are fixing it up, going back to 1992 and we have not got anywhere to look forward. The government has had since 1992 to think about what to do and we have yet got nowhere to go to look forward to resolve this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to hear what the government has to say as to its complete and manifest incompetence in this respect. As I pointed out at the time, we thought these matters were unconstitutional, but the government said, `No, no; we have legal advice.' We have a problem, shared by the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine, that the government makes available the advice it chooses to make available, but not necessarily all the advice. </PARA>
<PARA>I have the view&mdash;I may be wrong and I would be happy to be advised that I am wrong&mdash;that when some advice is to be tabled in parliament, the person giving the advice is requested to prepare advice that says, `This is constitutional.' I do not believe this government says to a legal adviser, `Please prepare advice to parliament which not only makes the case out for this being okay, but also outlines the alternative case.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interested to hear what Senator Spindler has to say in this respect. I know we have similar views with respect to the independence of the Privacy Commissioner in the sense that we do not have the opportunity to get that advice once it has been given to the government to therefore consider in a parliamentary sense whether what the government wants to do is right or not. I think similar arguments apply to the legal advice we are offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we could get an absolute guarantee that there is no alternative legal advice in the Attorney-General's Department, perhaps we could be more comfortable in relying on what the government tells us, but I do not think we will get that guarantee. I think the truth of the matter is&mdash;a phrase I hate to use because Senator Gareth Evans, who thinks he has some sort of proprietorial control over the truth, uses it almost every day, usually when he is in some trouble: `The truth of the matter is', claiming righteousness for himself&mdash;that when this government has advice prepared it requests the barrister preparing the advice that it be so structured as to ensure that the advice that might be released publicly just puts one side, the more positive side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, why should we ever rely on what the Attorney-General's Department tells us? I would be very happy if the minister in responding is happy to indicate that that is not the case. I would also be happy if he gave an undertaking&mdash;in respect of any areas in the life of this government, and the previous one&mdash;that all of the advice available to the government, including the constitutional risks, has been made available when it has been requested. We would not expect a government to cough up information arguing against its case if it is not asked to do so. I would not expect this government to do it. I think it would be an appropriate thing for governments, and a better thing for parliament, if perhaps it were done. </PARA>
<PARA>Lest anyone should think that this is labouring the point in terms of the degree to which this government is prepared to tell parliament what it is doing&mdash;to tell not just the truth but the whole truth and not just to say, `We have an opinion that says this is constitutional'; that is, to tell the whole truth about the other opinions that canvass the risks involved&mdash;let me say that there is a reasonably short list, and I would not want to make an exhaustive one because I would be here forever and a day, of Labor legislation that the High Court has fairly recently found to be unconstitutional. There was the Copyright Amendment Act in 1989; the Migration Amendment Act in 1987 and subsequent Migration Act amendments, and the very famous Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act in 1991 when Senator Bolkus stood over there and assured us that that act was not an excessive inhibition of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus assured us that the High Court would uphold what was in his mind a righteous piece of legislation, and assured us that all the Attorney-General's advice was that this bill would stand up. I would like to believe that, but it does not speak volumes for the competence of the legal advisers in the Attorney-General's Department if what Senator Bolkus said was true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody going to a lawyer does not expect to be given only the rosy picture. That is what the shonks do. To the extent that there are shonks in the legal profession, they are the sorts of people who tell you that you have a case, take all the costs from you and then, when you get to the door of the court, because they do not want to lose in front of their mates, say, `Look, it is about time you settled.' Settlement at the door of the court generally happens because one or other side knows that it is not worth going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should not happen because your legal adviser should give you all the warnings; not just the good news, but the bad news as well&mdash;the hurdles you are going to have to jump. I would have hoped that legal advisers in the Attorney-General's Department were doing that for the government, not just telling it what it wanted to hear; not just saying, `Yes, we will marshall a case for the bill being constitutional,' but also saying, `Here are the arguments against.' In that way, the government would be equipped to tell parliament the truth and the whole truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that some people on the other side of this chamber&mdash;excluding you, Mr Acting Deputy President and a number of others&mdash;could not give a damn what parliament was told; they are not remotely interested. The government should perhaps take what is a very rash step for it and be truthful with the whole community. The government would then be prepared should there be any High Court challenge. I just canvass that point. I like to think that the people in the Attorney-General's Department are being full and frank in their advice to the government, letting it know when there are problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extraordinary that time after time we are assured by the government, on the basis of its legal advice, that things are constitutional; but we later find out they are not. The political broadcasts and political disclosures were an obvious case for alternative arguments to be presented. In the end, while I understand the departments are there to serve the government of the day, the overriding purpose of serving the government of the day is to serve the nation. The nation is not well served if the government is offered poor, narrow, limited, misguided and incorrect legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you or I would not expect to go to a lawyer and not be warned of the pitfalls we were about to face. It seems inappropriate that an Attorney-General or a government goes to lawyers and is not warned. I am quite prepared to accept that people in the Attorney-General's Department are of very high calibre. That is indicated by the degree of poaching that has been going on lately by private firms which are hoping to reap great rewards from the commercialisation of the legal service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I am prepared to believe that, the other side of the coin has to be that when ministers say here, `We have given you the legal advice,' they are not telling the truth and the whole truth. That is clearly where any fault lies. I do not like to think for one minute that the department is not offering full and frank legal advice to the government. My belief is that the government, in not wanting to disclose that advice and not wanting parliament to make a decision on the basis of full and frank legal advice, is instructing people to prepare advice with very narrow terms of reference so the government can say, `Here is the advice we have received.' It can then shut up about the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act, there are the Industrial Relations Act of 1988, the Corporations Act, the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, where this parliament, in a rush to be seen to be doing something, tried to make a decision that was not a judicial decision. The government tried to turn it into one by allowing the decision to be registered in a court&mdash;as if that was all one needed to make it a judicial decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, the two key points I have sought to make&mdash;there are lots of points one could go on about in relation to this bill&mdash;are that the government was warned about the unconstitutionality of its amendments in 1992 and it refused to accept advice from the coalition as to the constitutional amendments it could make that would be seen to be, and would be, an improvement. In the government's pig-headed way, it proceeded and was caught out and found to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all make mistakes in judgement and we can forgive that. However, the government had good advice, not just from us but from people like Mr Morris QC who wrote an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> of March 1994. If the government does not want to believe us, perhaps it can believe people from the independent bar. Having had that advice from an early stage, the government still refused to cover its back and have people turning their minds to what would be the appropriate way to handle the problem should it arise. If the government had done that it would have come out the next day and said, `Here is plan B'. We are still fiddling around&mdash;still without a resolution from the government as to what it wants to do in this area. The government has been thinking about it since 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It indicates to me a lack of focus and a lack of preparedness to consider that the government might be wrong. It indicates a failure to prepare an alternative plan in case the government is wrong. It is a single-minded attitude where, once you have won the confidence of the people in the lower house, whatever you decide to do is right and you do not have to listen to anybody else. In his article Mr Morris said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking the risk&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that the legislation is valid&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the government is gambling with the money and emotional wellbeing of those citizens most deserving of its protection, namely the innocent victims of unlawful discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Morris makes a good point. This legislation is there to protect those most in need of parliament's protection. When the government was warned that it was unconstitutional and that it would not get its way, the government did not prepare an alternative plan B. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That obviously begs the question of the quality of the government's constitutional legal advice. The  question is: is the government getting good constitutional legal advice and ignoring it, or is there something wrong in the Attorney-General's Department? One or the other has to be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I believe that the first part of the bill with its substantive provisions has previously been debated in this chamber, but for completeness I will run over the main provisions again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements a number of the recommendations in the report of the committee set up to review the operations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The bill makes a number of changes to the management and corporate processes of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it gives the Attorney-General the opportunity to make a full-time or part-time appointment to the position of president. Secondly, it removes the requirement that the human rights commissioner necessarily be a lawyer and replaces it with a requirement that the commissioner must have the appropriate qualifications and background. That is something that the Australia Democrats welcome. Further, it proposes that the act be amended to provide that the responsibility for the management of the commission be vested in the commission as a body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end it creates a new position of chief executive officer and requires the commission to prepare a corporate plan. Currently the responsibility for the management of a commission is vested in the human rights commissioner to the exclusion of other commissioners and the commission itself. This bill removes that obligation on the human rights commissioner and vests in the commission as a whole the obligation to manage the commission as a collegiate body. The commission now will set the corporate and strategic direction and allow a manager to exercise delegated power on its behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other issues were raised in the debate, and I wish to comment briefly on two of them. I cannot possibly agree with the proposition that was put forward by Senator Vanstone that the human rights commission should, essentially, confine itself to the educative function. Important though that is&mdash;and that is acknowledged by the Australian Democrats&mdash;the human rights commission has an effective and noble record of righting wrongs that have been experienced by people who have been discriminated against. It should not be beyond the wit of the government, or beyond the wit of this chamber of parliament as a whole, to ensure that we have an effective mechanism to right these wrongs and an effective mechanism to ensure that whatever rulings are made by the human rights commission are implemented and are enforceable without undue delay, without undue cost and in a streamlined fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have obviously touched on the effects of the Brandy decision but, before I continue with that aspect of the bill, I will comment on one other point that was raised by Senator Vanstone; that is, the ready accessibility of parliamentarians to advice received by the government. This applies, in particular, to the advice that the government receives from statutory officers. I have had to move some amendments on a previous occasion, when the issue was whether rulings made by the human rights commissioner or by the privacy commissioner should, as of right, be available to parliamentary representatives. I believe they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone takes it a step further and suggests that the legal professional advice on matters of constitutional law received by the government should also be made available to parliament. I believe that has a lot of merit. For one, it will ensure that the debate is informed and is conducted at a level which is likely to produce the best possible result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn now to the part of the bill which is a response to the recent High Court decision of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This is the case that invalidated the enforcement provisions for determinations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The history behind the Brandy case began when the commission was granted the power to conciliate complaints of racial discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Originally this was its only power and, if conciliation failed, an action could be brought in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, however, the commission has been given powers to inquire into complaints and make determinations that unlawful acts of discrimination have occurred and, further, to order that the respondent pay compensation, if that was appropriate; employ the complainant&mdash;in other words, take specific action; or perform some other act of redress. Such findings might be said to be judicial but, up to 1992, when amendments were made to the act, the commission was not considered to be exercising judicial power because its determinations were not binding or enforceable. If a person refused to comply with the commission's determination, the complainant had to initiate an action in the Federal Court and the matter had to be heard de novo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that a complainant was often required to endure three investigations meant that the process was seriously flawed. It obviously imposed a heavy load in cost, time and energy. This led to an inquiry by the then Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and the human rights commission made a submission to the committee that its determinations should be registered with the Federal Court and take effect as if they were court orders, subject to the ability of the respondent to apply for a review by the Federal Court. The validity of this proposal was supported by an opinion of the chief general counsel, and the majority recommendation to follow this course of action was, in the end, adopted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation implementing these recommendations came into force in January 1993. In October 1994 the legislation was challenged in the High Court by Mr Harry Brandy, and on 23 February 1995 the High Court unanimously held that these registration and review provisions were unconstitutional. The court held that the legislative provisions purported to give the commission, which is an administrative body, power to make binding and enforceable decisions and that this was contrary to the constitution, which exclusively confers judicial powers on the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of this decision, therefore, is that the commission's determinations made under the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 are not legally enforceable if the respondent refuses to accept the determination by the commission. In response to this, the government is returning, in the second part of the bill, to the legislative scheme which existed prior to the 1992 amendments so that a new action will be needed in the Federal Court if a respondent fails to comply with a determination of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support this interim measure since there must be some avenue of enforcement for people who appear before the human rights commission complaining that there has been discrimination against them. The Federal Court, under the amendments proposed by the government, can then exercise its judicial power in making an adjudication. The Democrats have received assurances that this system is an interim measure only and that we will soon have a long-term solution to the problem of enforcing the decisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as, indeed, in the Democrats' view, they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has established a committee of inquiry, chaired by Mr John Basten QC, to draft a response to the decision of the High Court in the Brandy case&mdash;in other words, to propose a system and procedures which can overcome the difficulty that has been created. The objective of the committee is to create an accessible and cost-effective mechanism for resolving human rights complaints. Certainly, we will be awaiting the report of Mr Basten's committee with great interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another section in the new amendments which should be mentioned briefly. The second part of those amendments, clause 7A, allows the president of the commission to delegate power to review a decision of the commissioner not to pursue a complaint. The president has recently complained that too much of his time is tied up second-guessing the decisions of his fellow commissioners in cases that often lack merit. This amendment is intended to allow the delegation of that task to a member of the commission or certain other officials of the commission. The Democrats regard this as a sensible reform and will not be objecting to the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a brief comment on the amendments that have been circulated by Senator Chamarette. The first amendment seeks to add a sunset clause to the interim enforcement scheme so that these interim arrangements do not, through legislative inactivity, become the long-term scheme for the enforcement of the commission's decisions. The Democrats understand the reasons for this amendment and believe it is worthwhile, but we believe that the cut-off date of 1 November 1995 does not provide enough time. I would suggest to Senator Chamarette that if she were prepared to delete that date and insert the date of 1 May 1996&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens' second amendment allows applicants to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to go directly to the Federal Court and bypass the interim step of going through the commission. The Democrats believe that this has an appealing simplicity but that it would be unwise to change the legislation in ways that were not conceived when the various pieces of legislation were drafted and ahead of the report from the Basten committee. At this stage, we would be prepared to support the amendment only if Senator Chamarette is prepared to accept a Democrat amendment that both parties must agree to that process. If the Greens' amendment is acceptable, we will be in a position to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 [1995] and the government's proposed amendments. The initial bill basically deals with machinery matters that we on this side do not oppose. The bill seeks to implement some of the recommendations made in the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which was undertaken by the commission and the Department of Finance. Those machinery amendments are referred to in the second reading speech that has been presented. There is really no further need for me to elaborate on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is also before the Senate a raft of 12 pages of government amendments to this bill. Those amendments are in response to the so-called Brandy decision. The Brandy decision was a decision of the seven justices of the High Court of Australia in the case of Harry Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. Basically, the question that the High Court was asked to answer in that case was in consequence of the amendments embodied in the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 and/or the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1993 as they affect the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. If there were any, it needed to be determined which provisions of part III of the Racial Discrimination Act were invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer was yes in relation to sections 25ZAA, 25ZAB, 25ZAC and 25ZC; they were all considered to be invalid. Without going into the detail of the quite considered decision involving 27 pages of their honours, it is appropriate to try to summarise their decision. The fundamental point was to confirm that the judicial powers of the Commonwealth need to be exercised through the judiciary. Clause 71 of chapter III of our constitution, which deals with that very matter, states:</PARA>

<PARA>It is noteworthy to remember that, at the time this legislation was introduced, the opposition warned that it may well fall foul of that provision of our constitution. As I recall it, that warning was given in 1992. Colleagues of mine who served on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs before I arrived and the then shadow Attorney-General, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), warned the government about the potential problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it can be accepted that the government would not necessarily fully embrace the opposition's views and interpretations in relation to the law&mdash;which subsequently have been shown to be correct&mdash;I would have thought it incumbent upon the government at that time to at least consider a contingency plan as to what ought happen in the event that the views expressed by the opposition and others within the community were found to be correct. I believe it does not reflect well on the government that it simply sought to ignore that. It is typical of the arrogance and unwillingness of this government to listen to any ideas other than its own, especially on matters relating to our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We were told by the government that the 12 pages of amendments submitted to us by the government would be an interim response. That is something that, at the time the amendments were introduced, could have been considered as an appropriate response. It is worth noting that the government has now had some considerable time to resolve this matter on a more permanent basis, and it still has not been done. It ought be remembered that the High Court decision was delivered on 23 February 1995. There have now been some 3 1/2 months for the government to come up with a more detailed and permanent response. That is especially the case given that it was warned years ago about this very possibility. It is not something that came out of left field, completely unexpected by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was warned many years ago about this possibility. It completely and utterly ignored that possibility and kept going blindly down the track of ignoring the quite cogent arguments contrary to its own particular point of view. When you lose a decision such as this seven nil in the High Court, I would have thought that those charged with the responsibility of determining how this sort of legislation should have been framed must have at least canvassed the possibility of this situation arising. If they had canvassed it, they should have had a contingency plan ready in case of an adverse decision&mdash;and adverse it was, seven nil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice received by the government in relation to this matter and others does concern me. It appears as though the federal government has got it wrong regarding matters submitted before the High Court. I dare say that Minister Bolkus is a classic example in that regard. He or his department has a unique capacity to get the legal advice quite wrong. The unfortunate thing is that it appears as though the government has run out of steam or impetus. It seems to be quite complacent about the sort of advice proffered to it and is not willing to make even a contingency plan in the event that it is shown to be wrong. In relation to these 12 pages of amendments, we have an interim solution or a stopgap measure to put us back to the way the legislation stood prior to 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grapple with the whole issue of whether this human rights legislation ought to proceed into the area of making decisions, determinations and awards to people. I fully support the educational role and the importance of indicating to members of our community that all people ought be treated equally and that all people are equal just by virtue of being people and as a result of being human beings. As a result, discrimination on the grounds of disability, gender or race clearly is not to be accepted within a civilised community. We should therefore be seeking to assist those of a different persuasion to alter their opinions and code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If somebody is fined or an award is made against them under this legislation, it is a finding against them and something that they would have to carry with them. It is therefore appropriate that when those matters are determined, an appropriate judicial process be applied to ensure that there is procedural fairness, natural justice and equity afforded to persons who are having their matters determined by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bemoaned the fact previously in my speech that this was only an interim solution. However, I suppose every cloud has a silver lining and, given that this is only an interim solution, I would like to take the opportunity to ask the government when it comes back with its&mdash;I was about to say final solution but that is not necessarily a good term&mdash;final answer to the Brandy decision that it consider other amendments to this legislation so that there is a greater degree of fairness for all the participants in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters that I wish to raise relate to the questions of vicarious liability that the human rights commission will determine in relation to employers on the grounds of disability, discrimination, racial discrimination and sex or gender discrimination. As the legislation allows an employer to be taken before the commission for breach of the provisions of the legislation on a vicarious basis, it is my view that it would be appropriate to require the person making the complaint to put that in some sort of formal way to the employer within a specified period detailing the behaviour complained about. Possibly something like the provisions that apply for workers compensation may be appropriate so that the employer is notified of the details of the matter as soon as possible after an alleged breach has occurred so that the employer has a reasonable opportunity to address the matters and deal with them in a way that will ensure that the behaviour complained of is not repeated within the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that we can potentially have a situation where an employer is subjected to inappropriate behaviour at the workplace, that behaviour continues for some time and the employer need not necessarily become aware of it immediately, and then the employer finds himself or herself before the human rights commission on the vicarious liability aspects of the legislation trying to argue that he or she should have taken certain action. Under the vicarious liability sections the employer would have to indicate what reasonable steps had been taken to avoid the behaviour when in certain circumstances it may have been the case that the employer was not even aware that that particular behaviour was occurring in his or her workplace. I believe that that is an aspect that the government ought to address to give some degree of procedural fairness to the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which is of concern to me is that the human rights commission does not have the capacity&mdash;it is not clothed with the power&mdash;to award costs. It is my view that frivolous and vexatious claims could well be avoided in the human rights commission if the commission was given a discretionary power in relation to the question of costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not necessarily be the exercise of awarding costs to follow the event as a matter of course. It would be in special circumstances where the commissioner may be of the view that the complaint made was made for malicious, vexatious or frivolous reasons, in circumstances where an employer has been subjected to considerable time out from his or her employment, factory, business, or from the job, if it is a fellow employee; and, of course, the considerable legal costs that are occasioned should he or she seek to engage legal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of situations where, because the complainant is funded by legal aid, the employer says, `Well, this is going to take us five days before the human rights commission. Let's say, on a very cheap basis, $1,000 a day. That's going to be $5,000. I might as well offer the complainant $4,000 just to get rid of it so I don't incur the costs. Even if I do win at the end of the five days I'm still $5,000 out of pocket, so I might as well hand some money over and try to settle it on that basis.' Yet, the person who brings the complaint suffers no such financial penalty. I believe there needs to be some adjustment to the regime to ensure that there is equity for all sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possibly, this is more of a matter for the committee stage. I understand that on page 2 of the government's amendments, proposed section 105B will allow for assistance to be provided before the Federal Court in relation to those people seeking to defend a claim as well. That is subject to the guidelines determined by the Attorney-General. It would be doubtful whether the legal aid commissions would allow funding for people who would seek to defend claims that are frivolous, vexatious or indeed malicious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to those suggestions I have just made, it would be fair to say that the vast majority of cases that come before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would not be classified as malicious, frivolous or vexatious. They are properly grounded; the people have proper complaints to make. In those circumstances, and clearly in a minority of cases, I believe that the commission ought to be clothed, as should the Federal Court, with a capacity to award costs if they are of the view that they have been served with a tissue of lies or with a completely malicious case designed to hurt somebody and that there is no basis for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when we look at the High Court decision of Brandy, it is noteworthy that in determining the legal matters, just legal arguments, showing that the government was in fact wrong, the High Court awarded the costs of the plaintiff against the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. So the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, on a legal, technical point, had to pay the costs of Mr Brandy. If it were simply a vexatious and malicious claim, there would not be the possibility for Mr Brandy to recover his costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is something that the government ought to address when reconsidering the whole regime being covered by the human rights legislation. I look forward to further discussion of this matter in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are really only two areas of concern. It seems to us to be a sensible and logical reform that can help build our relations with foreign territories of the type that I have just mentioned. One concern relates to the costs that are associated with the change. The other concern is that, whenever there is an extension of immunity from criminal prosecution to a new range of persons, obviously that is something that must be addressed with great care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of costs, I understand that the government claims that it is not possible to assess the additional costs to the taxpayer by this legislation. There may be some benefit to the taxpayer through facilitating trade and through other ways, but there will quite clearly be a cost&mdash;if only for the additional protective services that will need to be provided pursuant to the extensions that are included within this legislation. </PARA>

As we on this side of the chamber are always interested in doing our best to protect the public purse, the taxpayers' money, I raise it again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to our second concern, that of the extension of immunity from prosecution, I note under the bill that that will be provided&mdash;as I read the bill&mdash;by regulation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition, whilst not opposing this bill, does have some concerns about the issues which it raises. According to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), it is part of an ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force. It is very unclear to us exactly how the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill relates to those aims. There does not seem to be any way in which efficiency and modernisation will increase as a result of this bill and the agenda seems to be more one of containment of costs. It really does nothing to improve the declining morale of members of the forces. It will not in any significant way improve management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the military superannuation benefits part of the act are sensible and we have no real problem with those; but it does raise the question of why 17 people were left out in the first place. That can only be attributed to some degree of, at best, inefficiency and, at worst, incompetence. It ties in with the feedback that a number of us get from communications with various defence forces on how efficient they are at answering mail, at answering queries and finding messages and that cause some problems for people with their interactions with the forces. This, clearly, is going to be an ongoing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the changes to the disciplinary parts of the act will be welcomed. For example, the maximum penalty now for extra drill&mdash;if I remember rightly without checking any figures in front of me&mdash;is limited to three hours over a period of three days. I am sure there are some in the forces who will benefit from that and welcome it. Certainly, it is a far cry from the days of the lash and keelhauling and those sorts of punishments. From that point of view, things seem to be improving very significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are some queries about that. It is unclear whether it is possible to suspend somebody on a fairly arbitrary basis, particularly if they are in an isolated area, without having some sort of hearing first. I would like the reassurance that there will be some sort of process where an independent hearing can be held before somebody can be suspended, particularly without pay. That does not require a prejudgment of the issues, just simply that there is a genuine case to answer. They should be in a similar position perhaps to public servants where a number of prerequisites are in place to protect the positions of public servants. Although the situations are obviously somewhat different, the same principles, I think, do apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the removal of the Governor-General's pleasure as a controlling factor, I am not really sure that that makes any real sense in improving the efficiency of the process. It may, indeed in some ways, have an impact upon the long-term career structures. The removal of the Governor-General's pleasure is ostensibly because of the workload involved. But, clearly, whoever does this&mdash;somebody has to do it&mdash;the Governor-General's workload, I am sure, is not overextended by this particular aspect of it. If you associate this with the removal of the involvement of the Executive Council, then we do have some concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Executive Council is a grossly underrated body. In many people's eyes it is just as important a part of our democratic system as cabinet or other parts of ministerial responsibility: there always need to be at least three people present; it is possible for appointments to be questioned; it is possible for an independent person&mdash;the Governor-General or, if he is not present, the vice-president of the council&mdash;to pass judgment on the particular merit of a recommendation. When you remove that power and have the potential for a ministerial whim to replace it, then you do not have a system which is better than the previous one&mdash;and I am rather concerned about that part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some particular changes to particular issues. The unlawful discharge of weapons: we would all accept that that is an issue which needed to be dealt with and I am confident that the approach here is a reasonable one. But I am not so sure about the offence of refusing to submit to a medical examination or to supply a specimen. It is an interesting change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the general world, my view has been that although in superficial terms it might be advantageous to allow people to be compulsorily tested for AIDS, it was a major infringement of their privacy and, indeed, in practical terms would never work because AIDS positivity, to use an example, is simply an ongoing situation&mdash;it may well change month by month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure exactly what is planned to apply in the forces here, but there does seem to be an element of intrusion into an individual's privacy. We accept that when people become part of the forces they do sacrifice some of those rights which might otherwise be theirs in the non-Defence Force world, but I am concerned that there does not seem to have been enough discussion and debate about this as an issue. I really do think that this needs more exposure to public discussion and debate in terms of what is, in effect, compulsory AIDS, hepatitis B or other testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can understand, but not necessarily agree with, the underlying philosophy of the importance of this. Particularly in areas of war, where contaminated blood may be a particular problem, one can understand the concerns; but this needs greater airing and greater exposure to public discussion. There are a number of issues there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems of this bill is that it really does nothing to improve the self-reliance of our armed forces, which is really what we all want to achieve. As I understand it, the personnel wastage rate in the navy is something like 13.5 per cent, the army has 13 per cent, and even the air force has seven or eight per cent. It is this loss of experienced personnel which is one of the issues at the crux of the problems facing our Defence Force, and this legislation does nothing to address these. It is a vicious circle, because overworked personnel leave, particularly if they have less job satisfaction; and once they leave, the pressure on those who are left is greater, and they in turn leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the navy has real problems filling its submarine billets. The navy put out a public document saying `submariners are a rare breed'. They are rare not only because of the special qualities required for life under the waves, but rare because only 650 of the 818 billets in the submarine squadron are filled. The navy has only 53 per cent of its required number of submariner communicators. To put it another way, if all of the six new Collins submarines, costing $4 1/2 billion, were put into the water now, three would remain tied up in dock because of the shortage of qualified crew members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the RAAF, we find that there is a problem with air traffic controllers.

Effectively, close to half of our reserve forces seem to be in what might reasonably be described as an ineffective state. Clearly, those problems are going to get worse with the ending of the recession. As more jobs become available, people will vote with their feet. In the end, we are going to be losing experienced personnel. </PARA>

However, I do have to say, as I have said before, that I do not consider omnibus bills are necessarily the best way of presenting such legislation. There are several very important areas covered in this bill, the TGA area in particular. In general, the amendments we have before us are relatively straightforward, largely administrative and generally uncontroversial. However, there are two matters that I wish to comment on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first relates to the amendments covering exempt beds in nursing homes. Nursing homes with `exempt bed status' are permitted to charge additional fees for providing a higher standard of service or accommodation. In other words, they are at the top end of the market. At the moment, there is no mechanism by which the exempt bed status of one of these nursing homes can be suspended or revoked if the home fails to meet the outcome standards set under the National Health Act. This is an anomaly which makes no sense at all. After all, it is clearly not in anyone's interest&mdash;not in the interests of the government and certainly not in the interests of residents or their families&mdash;to permit a nursing home to charge extra amounts for its so-called superior or luxury services when its level of nursing care is not up to scratch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill get rid of that anomaly and make it clear that, where the exempt bed status of a nursing home is suspended or revoked, a proprietor will be unable to charge the additional fees. Any decision to suspend or revoke exempt bed status will be subjected to review by the AAT. The minister has said that this power will only be exercised where there are serious breaches of the standards and I think this is a sensible approach to take. In my view, where these amendments are concerned, the government seems to have got it right and has acted relatively promptly to address this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I wish to comment on the other section of the bill we are concerned about and that is the amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act. Once again, generally, these amendments are fairly straightforward and are designed to improve the process of regulation of therapeutic goods. I believe the industry will generally benefit from these new streamlined processes for listing products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This has been a vexed area for some time, and I know that many of my colleagues here have been contacted by manufacturers and importers, in particular, complaining about the delays in TGA approvals for their products. The government believes this new electronic lodgment process will reduce the time frame for approval from an average of five months to two weeks. If that goal is able to be achieved that will be a significant step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome amendments which set up a mechanism to address shortages of critical drugs in emergency situations. This also is a sensible move. At the moment, only individual patients are allowed access to unapproved drugs in limited amounts&mdash;that sort of arrangement is obviously not going to be appropriate in all circumstances. For example, I think it makes sense to permit a company to bring in a particular product which is registered overseas, but not in Australia, when the company has run out of stock of that particular product. It makes sense to move beyond individual permits and allow the limited supply of drugs which have been approved in countries which we know have reputable regulation programs. That, too, is a step in the right direction and one that perhaps opens the door, further along the track, for even more streamlined processes of approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also sets up a new accelerated process for listing certain therapeutic goods that are supplied for use in Australia. This will cover over-the-counter drugs including herbal and vitamin preparations. Once again, this should result in a speedier process with, hopefully, no drop at all in quality or standards. The amendments also move to clarify the definition of what constitutes a `therapeutic good' in the light of confusion, and some legal uncertainty, about how `food' fits into that definition. I accept the need for this clarification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to comment on fees and charges under the TGA because I believe that we have a problem developing here. While I acknowledge that the industry was involved in negotiating the fee structure, I think it is fair to say that the impact of higher and higher fees was not recognised either by the industry or by the government. Looking at the figures over the past few years, it can be seen that the rise in fees goes hand in hand with a drop in registrations. When talking with the industry, people all say the same thing: listing charges are becoming so prohibitive, especially for those companies which hold multiple listings, that companies are not bothering to list goods which could be used in the Australian market&mdash;in other words, goods which could be of advantage to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One importer has assured me that his company is simply not making applications for listing in a number of areas because of the fees which he considers are too high. He argued that it was ridiculous to be paying such high fees for products which were already approved for use in countries such as Sweden, Britain and the United States. In his view, Australians were missing out on a range of products because more and more companies did not feel that they could afford the fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures would seem to bear out his claim and I think the minister needs to look very closely at these concerns. For example, when we look at the figures for evaluation fees, we see that as the fees have gone up the total revenue from fees is dropping dramatically. I think those figures should tell the government something. They at least should raise the possibility that fees and charges have already got to an unsustainable level, a level which is acting as a major disincentive to register products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister several questions here rather than waiting for the committee stages of this bill. Is the minister monitoring the impact of the increase in fees? Does the minister believe that the level of 50 per cent industry contribution to the TGA by 1996-97 is still a realistic goal? Can we please have provided for us&mdash;and I acknowledge that this may take a few days&mdash;full details of the level of fees over the last three years showing their increases, comparing that with the level of total revenue and also with the level of total registrations? Given that the level is now only 37 per cent, and that registrations are apparently declining, I think there are some questions that need very careful consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a number of questions, but I notice that the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health (Senator Crowley) is not present. There are a number of questions that I want to raise that I am not sure the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) will be able to answer. He can have a go at answering them, I suppose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 is an omnibus bill. It is one that was agreed was a piece of non-controversial legislation. As a matter of fact, when I was asked whether I would agree to this being treated as a non-controversial piece of legislation I looked at the specifics as they related to the amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act, in schedule 1. I had not seen the provisions relating to the TGA. I have asked a number of questions over a number of years in relation to the TGA and, frankly, I am not prepared at this stage to see this matter through this lunchtime debate until we have somebody here who is able to answer questions on that. I am not prepared to deal with this until I have had answers to questions on the TGA raised at the estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I would like to ask certain questions first of all in respect of page 4 of the legislation, where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A child cannot be a dependent child unless he or she:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)is aged under 13 years; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)has turned 13 but is aged under 17 and is a child to whom a determination under subsection (3) applies.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to go to the question of whether or not a child is a dependant only if that child is under the age of 13. I do not know how many people around this place would agree with that provision, that is in this amendment and also the principal act at the moment, as being valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children who have turned 13 are still dependants&mdash;unless we are going to have a policy situation in which those children are to be latchkey teenagers. Surely to goodness, in respect of this child-care rebate system, recognition should be given to the need for some guidance, some care, some supervision sometimes, of children who happen to have turned 13 years of age. Yet the government is not providing a child-care rebate in respect of those children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of families who have both parents working. Some of this is through choice; a lot of it is through absolute necessity, to make ends meet. A number of those parents want some care, some supervision, provided during the period from the end of school, say 3 o'clock or 3.30 p.m., until they get home, which in some of the capital cities, after the rush hour, is not until 7 o'clock if they happen to be working in a retail store. Under this legislation and under the principal legislation there is no recognition of that need. Those children are not regarded as dependants for some reason or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask the minister: why is that the situation? I know this amendment is to give the minister the ability to make a specific determination about a child who has turned 13 but is aged under 17; I really would like to know from the government why it is continuing to adopt this particular attitude with respect to children&mdash;teenagers&mdash;who clearly are dependent in many situations and do need to have some sort of supervision. </PARA>

It is one that is a very real question to parents of teenagers. Once children get to the age of 13, they do not suddenly become independent. I would remind the Senate that the Department of Finance trots this out on every occasion it can seize. It trots out the proposition that, for the purposes of family allowances, family payments and so on, people really have to look at whether a person is dependent. Cabinet ministers know, people in the Public Service know, that Finance trots out this proposition every chance that it gets to try to bring down the age of dependency so that the payments need not be made.

I fully appreciate that it has put the minister in an awkward situation and for that I apologise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most important point is that this is a definition, for the purposes of this legislation, of a dependent child for the purposes of the rebate. That is, as Senator Harradine says, the important point. I certainly have absolutely no dispute with the concern, regard and care for our children. I am not sure that we should spend too long discussing that, but it is a matter of the greatest concern that we do ensure that our children are provided for and that families are assisted in that fairly challenging task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do have here is an enabling clause that will allow, under certain circumstances, children older than 13 to be eligible to receive the rebate. In particular, it is a provision that I have been very concerned to introduce regarding families with children who have a disability. They may be unable to get that kind of assistance and certainly do need that special kind of care outside school hours. So we are moving to enable that kind of care and continuity of care to be provided for children with disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not to be seen as open slather and it certainly would be on a case by case basis. There would be a number of cases of children with disability. I have had a number of letters from parents with children, particularly, with intellectual disability, who may not be equivalent to normal children of 13 or 14 years of age and would be particularly in need of that kind of supervisory care. It is very important that we have the opportunity to enable those children to continue to be able to be assisted in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also very clear that many children over the age of 13 are not enthusiastic participators in outside school hours care. We have had a number of letters about that also. What we have got here is a matter of judgment, a matter of balance, to try and assist families in the best way we can. The clause in this legislation enables that little bit of flexibility, particularly when there is a very justifiable case, as in the case of children with disability. </PARA>

This is a matter, really, that goes to the question of the adequacy or otherwise of family income and whether or not there is a true freedom of choice on the part of at least one parent to be able to be there when the children come home from school.

I acknowledge that the government has taken that on board and I appreciate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the proposed provision dealing with administrative amendments.

Under those circumstances, the mother, who is the worker, pays the fees and gets a cash rebate. I will not go into how much that is, but there is a minimum threshold that she has to pay. The mother is paying tax on the $70 that the employer pays to her, and she also gets a cash rebate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult to counter all the points that you have raised, Senator Harradine. However, in the example best known in this area of salary sacrificing, we could not approve or support that a parent whose child-care fees are paid by an employer is eligible for a cash rebate against fees that the parent did not pay. The first example that we have clarified in this area is that there is no rebate payable to parents for fees that they do not effectively pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation would also apply if the employer passes a parent a cheque and says, `Take this cheque to the child-care centre and pay your fees.' I must say that, on all the evidence we have been given, an example like that is absolutely hypothetical. I have been provided with no real example of an employer providing an employee with a cheque with which to pay fees. Although I do know of examples of agreements between employers and employees to reduce the salary equivalent to the amount of the child-care fees, as I said, we do not judge it appropriate that people should get a cash rebate against fees that they have not paid. It is more in the realm of a hypothetical that you are raising, Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that people are not denied eligibility for the rebate if they have properly paid their fees.

Over the last few years, I believe those checks have declined almost to the extent that a distrust is developing in the overall outcomes of therapeutic goods in Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act as it stands allows individual patients to access unapproved drugs in limited circumstances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although both of these schemes are used with advantage to permit the supply of small volumes of unregistered drugs, they are too unwieldy and too slow to make available substitute drugs, or new drugs, on a larger scale to meet an unforeseen emergency or to permit interim supply of a product registered overseas during the period of evaluation in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . In this context, Australia has a number of arrangements in place for the interchange of information with reputable drug regulatory agencies around the world. These include the United States, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Through its membership of the PER (Pharmaceutical Evaluation Reports) Scheme, Australia is a position to deal with most European agencies and with South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>My concern is that that is the thin end of the wedge. I have a letter on my desk from a physician from the UK who is currently living in Melbourne. He has suffered enormously as a result of the type of evaluation process that exists in the United Kingdom and I bring that to the attention of the government and of the chamber. What is happening here in Australia is disconcerting. We are fast-tracking drug evaluations to the extent that dangers signs are ringing. It is even happening in our own CTN programs&mdash;the clinical trial notification programs&mdash;and in the CTX programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may not know, but people in this department will know, that an allegation was made at a recent AHEC workshop in Canberra that payments of between $2,000 and $6,000 have been made by some drug companies to medical practitioners for the recruitment of patients as human subjects for trials. Surely that is a matter of grave concern to anybody who is interested in the appropriateness, accuracy and safety of trials. Indeed, I have mentioned this to the department at estimates committees and I have indicated it to some institutional ethics committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the CTN program there was nothing else required of a sponsor for a new drug than to obtain the approval of an ethics committee. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has admitted in estimates committee that in respect of CTNs it is simply the post box&mdash;that it is only registered there and the TGA has nothing more to do with it. If an institutional ethics committee gives the okay, then, that is it. That institutional ethics committee might indeed have a vested interest in the area. It might be an ideological vested interest, as in the case of the family planning ethics committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, the manager of Family Planning New South Wales was an active member of the ethics committee which approved the trials of RU486, the abortion drug. Is that an appropriate situation to have occur in this country? It is certainly not arm's length. Indeed, that goes to the question of the ability of some of these ethics committees to make decisions. Bear in mind that it is on those decisions that approvals are given for clinical trials to proceed. So there is that ideological conflict of interest. </PARA>

Incidentally, the allegations that I mentioned in relation to drug companies are not my allegations. They were made at a meeting convened by AHEC, in respect of IECs, in Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a better view, as Senator Ray reminds me&mdash;on a considered view, a more mature view&mdash;it is perfectly, technically feasible. I thought at the time and I still think now it is not politically feasible. I think it is bizarre, in fact, for that situation to occur.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett, in an interview that he did on the ABC radio this morning, readily acknowledges that there would in fact be an oddity about that. I am just trying to find the particular quote that refers to that issue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They may argue they represent a greater number of people, but finally this is going to be decided by each and every one of us. A convention to me is just another committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's not much point calling out 400 people out of a community of 18 million, sitting them down and saying: now what do you think about it?</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Kennett's view. And what indeed does the opposition think about their state Premier in Victoria dropping a God-awful bucket on that particular proposal? Here is the relevant bit about the states&mdash;you might just ponder the implications of that for the great convention proposal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it would mean changes throughout the States,&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I don't think Her Majesty herself would seek it appropriate to have a republic here in Australia, and some of the States still owing allegiance back to her.</PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Kennett obviously concedes the point that politically, practically and from any other point of view it is a bit of a nonsense. But nonetheless we are not seeking on this or anything else to shove anything down anyone's throats like feeding a Strasbourg goose. It is a matter for the Australian population to make their own particular judgment about what they want to do in this respect. They will make that judgment in a referendum. So far as individual states are concerned, if state by state they want to retain the capacity to go down some different path, then they are welcome to do so.</PARA>

The act has been of great benefit to Australians, not solely as a vehicle for redress for victims of discrimination, but also for setting acceptable standards of behaviour in our society.

We will be taking measures to ensure we can build on it in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also very keen to ensure that Australian society continues to benefit from our multicultural diversity. As senators might be aware, the national agenda for multicultural Australia was set down in 1989. It has been revisited and updated with the objective of reflecting a changing and maturing society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Minister, you would be well aware of the growth of Australian service industries as exporters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans is right, which is a phrase I use often. Australia's services sector has become increasingly internationalised over the past decade. In fact, services exports were about $19 billion in the last financial year&mdash;about a quarter of our total exports. I think it has been a rapid change that has gone unnoticed by many people, both domestically and internationally, because traditionally Australia has been a net importer of services, which has been a substantial contributor to our historic current account deficit. Current forecasts estimate that Australia will have become a net exporter of services by the end of 1995-96&mdash;a significant part of the strategy of changing the balance and profile of Australia's exports and the medium-term strategy to do with the current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While, of course, tourism is our largest service export industry, it is important to recognise the increasing role of higher value added services, and strong growth in one sector&mdash;like financial services to which Senator Evans referred&mdash;can generate successful export spin-offs for other sectors such as computer software. Exports of computer software and licence fees is actually one of Australia's hidden success stories. We have moved from deficit to surplus in this sector over the last five years, and our exports have grown to almost $400 million in the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I was pleased to announce the sale by AMP of an insurance software package to South Africa's largest life insurance office. It is a very significant achievement for AMP, and it won it against strong international competition. AMP's excellence in insurance has led to this spin-off for information technology exports. This is its second and most important international sale of its ULTIMAAS superannuation software package. I think it is the start of an important new export earner. It is an example of new export strengths for Australia's firms and new market opportunities opening up for those firms in South Africa, which I know is a particular area of interest to Western Australian senators like Senator Evans.</PARA>

They could follow AMP's example and show entrepreneurial flair and get out and sell some of those systems internationally as, of course, the Department of Social Security has done. They should look to see whether any of their internal management and administrative systems are commercially viable and whether they can be exported because that is the direction in which trade is going.</PARA>

Does the government concede that this tax is likely to increase rents paid by millions of Australians because the higher costs of repairs, maintenance and building faced by landlords will be passed on? Wouldn't this increase of about $120 a year, according to the HIA, negate the extra $2.50 a week which has just been granted in rental assistance for families? And as we are having a rather unedifying competition in this country over who best represents the battlers, does the minister concede that the higher rents and the lower public housing constitute a threat to those battlers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not think we were having an unedifying battle over who represents the battlers. I thought that had been won by a knockout blow by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives last week. Indeed, if we had the same levels of taxation as the Libs had when they were in power, Australians would be paying $9 billion a year more in taxation than they do now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Senator Kernot's question: first of all, the government's view is that the impact for renters from the budget with the change in wholesale sales tax on building supplies is likely to be minimal or negligible, whichever of those two words you prefer. We hold this view because it depends, obviously, on the repairs and maintenance activity that is undertaken by landlords and if landlords then pass that cost on to the renters. Indeed, many landlords are in receipt of negative gearing, so if you use that factor to offset, the actual pass-through impact would also be very low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if you look at the budget in its macro context, what is very clear is that in the broad settings of the budget the pressures are on bringing interest rates down, and that means that home affordability for most Australians would be enhanced. I think that is obviously a signal that rents are not likely to rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for those reasons, and because this is a true market, the budget should have overall a worthwhile effect on housing affordability and on the rental market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as low income earners are concerned, the government, as always, is concerned about their situation and the social justice measures protecting their position. Can I just say that between 1983 and now, rent assistance for families with three or more children has increased from $10 a week to $44 a week, an increase in real terms of around 140 per cent. Over the same period, rent assistance for single people has increased by around 90 per cent in real terms, and for couples without kids by around 80 per cent in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also extended rent assistance to unemployed people and to low income working families and removed waiting periods for rent assistance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Burns for his question. It is the case that the manufacturing and services production data contained in the national accounts tell a very good story about Australia's industrial performance. Total Australian production grew by 0.7 per cent in the March quarter of this year. This takes total production to a record level of $409.6 billion in the 12 months to the March quarter. That is expressed in 1989-90 dollars, so in real terms today it would be higher. Almost all the production growth in the latest quarter was due to rises in production by the services and manufacturing sectors. Combined, these sectors account for 83 per cent of GDP. Services account for 67 per cent and manufacturing accounts for 16 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go first to the manufacturing sector. March quarter growth was the 13th consecutive quarter of output growth. This is a growth phase unprecedented in both its strength and duration. The rise of 0.5 per cent in the quarter takes the year to March growth rate of manufacturing production to seven per cent. That is compared to 4.8 per cent growth for total production growth. That means that the manufacturing sector continues to grow at a faster rate than the economy overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total manufacturing output was at an all time high of $65.1 billion in the year to March, again in 1989-90 prices. Comparing 1994 manufacturing production with 1993 manufacturing production, we find that it has grown by 10.4 per cent. On this basis, the strongest growth was achieved by the printing, publishing and recorded media, non-metallic mineral product area and the machinery and equipment areas and other manufacturing. But, importantly&mdash;I know that senators follow this issue&mdash;the textile, clothing and footwear and leather industries recorded the largest growth of the quarter, which is a growth of 13.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the services sector, we see a record high of $274.8 billion of output in the 12 months to March, again in 1989-90 prices. Services production this quarter was 6.2 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. As well as these strong, solid production figures, we have also seen strong export performances from the manufacturing and services sectors. All of this is no surprise to those people genuinely interested in the performance of the Australian economy and who watch developments as they occur. This performance is underpinned by good productivity improvements brought about by the sound industrial relations policies of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have presided over a 25 per cent growth in hourly labour productivity since taking office in 1983. Real unit labour costs have fallen by 6.3 per cent in this period while at the same time full-time adult ordinary earnings have increased in real terms by 8.7 per cent. Real household disposable income has increased by 40 per cent. Our competitiveness has increased by 40 per cent as well.

The Commonwealth committed $12 million in the budget over four years.

I am asking you to reconsider because all that is being asked of the minister is whether what he said on a particular day is now consistent with alternative reports and he is being asked to explain why, since the inconsistency is apparent on the face of it, he should not admit to misleading the Senate. If he has not misled the Senate, he should have an explanation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's budget was described as a smoke and mirrors budget. This whole republican play also involves smoke and mirrors. Last night's act was one of the great deceptions of all time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He presented himself as the great snake oil salesman. He pretended that this proposition involves no change and that all the government is doing is changing the name of the Governor-General to `President'. Mr Keating understands that the Australian people are very suspicious of everything he does and will not buy this without it being presented in a very deceptive way involving no change except in name. But this is no simple change; that is the message that the Australian people will get tonight from the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and Mr Keating are proposing very fundamental change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is creating a completely new office&mdash;the office of President of the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;but it will not even attempt to define the powers of this new office, which is the most extraordinary proposition I have heard. This new president will be elected by the parliament with his or her own mandate. That person will be able to be dismissed only by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. He or she will have enormous powers that will not be codified. There will be far less restraint on the exercise of these powers than is currently the case. The government is proposing a fundamentally and inherently dangerous change to the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many constitutional lawyers are saying, and will continue to say, that it is absurd to create the new office of president and yet not say what the powers of this office will be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a magnificent and delicious irony for those opposite who are maintaining the rage of 1975. The president that they want to create will have all the powers that Sir John Kerr had when he dismissed their government. But there will be far less restraint on this president than was the case with Sir John Kerr. This president cannot be dismissed by a mere phone call to the Queen. This president can only be dismissed by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. This president will have far less restraint in the exercise of the significant powers he or she has. I have no idea how any of those who are full of rage from 1975 could possibly accept this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a very fundamental problem in not attempting to codify these powers. The government knows that, if it attempts to codify the powers, the thing would have absolutely no hope of getting passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's other major problem is public opinion. There is no sustained majority for going to a republic. None of the major polls have yet to show that a majority of Australians want a republic. So the government has at least half the community against it. When it asks people how the president would be elected&mdash;assuming that there would be a president&mdash;80 per cent of the community want that person to be elected by the people. They do not want the government's option of election by politicians, because they do not trust politicians. After 12 years of government, I can understand why they do not want politicians appointing the president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now learn today that the government even has the leader of the Labor Party in Victoria against it. Mr Brumby said today that his personal view is that presidents should be popularly elected and that ideally his or her powers should be codified.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking of history, Madam Deputy President, I take this opportunity to commend you on your recent election to the position that you hold. Other colleagues of mine have commented on the history of you, a woman, occupying that position. I add my congratulations to those of my colleagues. Moving back to the debate, last night at our caucus meeting members of the Labor Party were addressed before the Prime Minister's statement in the House of Representatives. It brought my mind back to a person to whom a lot of credit is owed for the fact that this debate is so public today. The person I refer to is the late Colin Jamieson, a previous leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Colin Jamieson seconded a motion that the Labor Party constitution should be altered to include republican words in the platform of the Labor Party at a conference in Perth in 1981 I believe. He then took that resolution to Melbourne, where the national conference of the Labor Party was being held. After some forceful debate, the conference adopted, in the aims and objectives of the Labor Party, that Australia should become a republic. That was 14 years ago. This issue is not new to the Australian public; it is certainly not new to the Australian Labor Party. The debate did not start in 1981; it was around a long time before that. It does show that the debate can move, as we have witnessed here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition are now willing to talk about Australia becoming a republic. I confidently predict that this will happen within the next five years. I believe that, when the Australian people are fully informed about it and the matter is fully debated not only by those in favour of the republic but those in opposition to it, when the numbers are counted in the referendum&mdash;that is, not only the majority of numbers throughout Australia but also in the majority of states&mdash;there will be in support for Australia becoming a republic by the year 2000. I believe when the Olympic Games are held in Sydney that it will be an Australian, as an Australian head of state, who will be opening those games. That will avoid some of the shame that we would experience were we to have a leader who was not an Australian open the games on behalf of us. That is only a very short time away, but the debate is happening and it is a very good debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that, whilst different names of different contributions have been tossed around here this afternoon regarding who is in favour and who is against, it shows that individuals from various spectrums of the debate are now coming out and making an input. Some of this is positive, some of it is negative. Some people making comment obviously do not understand what they are saying, but they are raising new questions. Mr Keating did not say that his speech last night was the end of the matter. In actual fact, in caucus he told us that it was the start of the third stage in the debate. What was put down in the House of Representatives last night was not the final say. The people who will be having the final say on this issue will be the people of Australia. They will be doing that democratically through the ballot box, through the referendum that will be held throughout Australia in 1998 or 1999. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The text of this matter of public importance reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The damage done to Australian families and small businesses by the high tax policies of the Keating Government.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter has been brought forward because of the government's dishonesty in pretending that it is not a high taxing government and that its huge taxes are not damaging Australia's families and small businesses. It is about time the truth came out and the government's position was demonstrated to be shonky, phoney and dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It clearly is the highest taxing government in some areas. For example, I demonstrated yesterday that in regard to sales tax, this government is now hitting Australian consumers with the highest proportion of sales tax as a proportion of GDP in Australia's history. The government knows this and is up to its usual deceptive stunts to try to hide the truth. The facts are clear: total taxes and, basically, all major taxes have risen by more than the inflation rate over the 13 or so years this government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individual income taxes have increased 136.8 per cent since 1983. Total company tax is up by a massive 370 per cent. Total indirect tax has risen by 149.8 per cent. Sales tax alone is up by 305.7 per cent and total tax revenue has gone up by about 190 per cent. This 190 per cent increase in total tax revenue is occurring over a period when inflation is only 68.9 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there is a huge real increase above the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Australians are constantly told by Labor that they live in a low tax country. Naturally, very few Australians believe it. Why would Australians believe the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and his government when they know perfectly well how much they were deceived by the government at the last election, with phoney promises about tax cuts? The fact is that tax increases are set to outstrip the rate of inflation by over nine per cent per annum during the 13 years of the present Labor government. On top of the high tax that Australians pay, there is also the internationally relatively high cost of compliance. No other industrialised country, with the possible exception of the US, has compliance costs anywhere near as high as those in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response is that you cannot just look at these total tax rises. What you have to do is look at tax as a proportion of gross domestic product. Well, I have done that. This government is still the worst ever in some instances&mdash;I noted sales tax&mdash;despite some disgraceful and totally dishonest attempts to fiddle the books or, in view of some responses yesterday and the day before, should I say `cook the books' to show a phoney result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me demonstrate how this government manages to lie with statistics. On Tuesday, Senator Cook gave the perfect example of this by sneakily changing the statistics to pretend that they suit his case. On page 862 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he referred to the ratio of tax to GDP, imperiously claiming that the huge post-1993 election rise from 22.1 per cent of tax as a percentage of GDP to 24.2 per cent in 1995-96, and then forecast to go to 24.6 per cent in 1996-97, did not break any promises not to raise taxes. He then pretended that this was better than when the coalition was last in government. How did he prove that? Very simply&mdash;he did not refer to the same measure at all. He simply did not refer to the ratio of tax to GDP. Not on your life! He sneakily changed the words. He said `total revenue', not `total taxes'. Is that not fascinating? This is a very different measure indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate can clearly see, the more the government sells off government bodies like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, the less revenue it earns from them. Revenue does not equal taxes and Senator Cook knows that. Revenue has been going down from these external agencies, government business enterprises and so on, yet Senator Cook pretended that they are the same as tax. Yesterday he made the same sneaky deception, on page 981 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the last coalition government when John Howard was Treasurer, in 1982-83, government revenue as a percentage of GDP was at 26.0 per cent. Under our government, it is at 25.3 per cent. In other words, the high taxing party of Australian politics is the coalition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't that marvellous! Change revenue to tax and you can prove whatever dishonest point you want to make&mdash;that is if you are made that way. I would suggest that that is typical of the way this government has handled this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, why did Senator Cook change tax as a measure to compare with 1983 into revenue? Was it simply because John Howard's last budget, in which I was involved as parliamentary secretary, had a tax to GDP ratio of only 24 per cent&mdash;lower than this budget and far lower than next year's forecast? Clearly, Senator Cook will do anything to create the false impression that his government is not the biggest taxing government in Australian history next to the Whitlam government. The facts are simply irrefutable. He said, `The level of taxation under us is lower than the level of taxation under the coalition.' That is simply false, false, false!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To clear up the other revenue point, government revenue, such as dividends from GBEs, has fallen from 2.1 per cent in 1982-83 to only 1.1 per cent of GDP in this budget. Let us have no more deception from Senator Cook's cooking of the budget books. Let us stick to the government's high tax record, without this kind of disgraceful deception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I think we should see that there is no room for disagreement. The last figures for income tax are clear. In Mr Howard's last budget, income tax totalled 16.3 per cent of GDP; this year's budget lifts it to 17.6 per cent. On every measure there is a totally deceptive response by this government. Under this government, company tax is up by 25 per cent&mdash;from 2.8 per cent of GDP under Mr Howard to 3.5 per cent now. That is a further disincentive to Australian corporate competitiveness with lower taxing Asian nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On personal income tax, plus fringe benefits tax&mdash;which clearly applies to it&mdash;collections in 1982-83 totalled 13.3 per cent of gross domestic product. That is the same as this year, despite the false claims of huge l-a-w, law, personal tax cuts by the government. There has been no cut whatsoever in income tax collections as a proportion of GDP by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to sales tax&mdash;the most classic&mdash;where there has been something like a 52 per cent increase in sales tax collections just since the last budget. What do we know about sales tax? We know that, according to an EPAC background paper in 1991&mdash;the government's own body&mdash;the changes in the wholesale sales tax appear to have increased the regressivity of this tax. The distributional impact of the tax has only marginally changed for most income deciles, with the exception of the lowest decile where the tax burden has increased notably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, Mr Warren, who did this study, also found that the tax burden has increased particularly noticeably for the bottom 10 per cent of income earners&mdash;the poorest in our community. They are the people being hit by this government's record sales taxes and by its huge increases in ordinary taxes. We see that the burden of the wholesale sales tax clearly falls most heavily on low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics for 1993-94 published by the Australian Taxation Office show that motor vehicle parts and accessories, household appliances, furnishings and hardware, machinery and equipment, and beer, wine and spirits account for almost three quarters of total sales tax revenues. Every average family is involved in buying those. They are the ones being hit. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that, when I saw that the matter of public importance submitted for discussion today was moved by Senator Baume, I thought: what sort of extraordinary performance are we going to get to justify taking up the Senate's time for an hour today? After hearing that speech, there is no justification whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I could discern from Senator Baume's speech was some argument over definitional terms of whether it was revenue or tax that affected the figure of determining the state of the Australian economy&mdash;that is, our performance compared with Mr Howard's performance when he was Treasurer in the last coalition government those many 12 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume accused Senator Cook, representing the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in this place, of misleading the Senate. Senator Cook did not mislead the Senate. Senator Cook has outlined to the Senate on innumerable occasions the success we have had&mdash;compared with the success of Mr Howard when he was Treasurer&mdash;in getting a successful economy, creating employment, getting low inflation and stability in interest rates and in getting an economy people are able to invest in with confidence, because we have an economy that is not only growing domestically but also growing in the international arena with exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is astonishing that an hour of the Senate's time is to be wasted on this matter of public importance so that an arcane point of semantics can be used by Senator Baume. We now know why people are wondering about the relevance of the Senate in the debate about legislation. The time of the Senate has been wasted by the opposition over the last three weeks because the opposition has refused to debate legislation of substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this matter of public importance proposed by Senator Baume, we now have another example today of an hour being wasted. I think this is the third occasion in the last two weeks I have seen small business mentioned in a matter of public importance. But Senator Baume never mentioned one word about small business in his remarks. He never mentioned one word about Australian families. He was trying to prove a semantic point about whether an issue involved tax or revenue&mdash;absolutely irrelevant to the performance of the economy in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For Senator Baume's benefit I will put on the record a range of very salient facts about the economy. Under this government real household disposable incomes have increased by 40 per cent. Under Labor real increases in additional family payments have been up to 150 per cent. Between December 1982 and December 1994 single income families on two-thirds of male average weekly earnings with two dependent children have had an increase in their real after tax income of $49 a week. This is very largely due to the improvements in the social safety net, particularly improvements in family payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor, pensions have increased by nearly 14 per cent in real terms. Under the coalition, they went down by two per cent.

It goes on, but I will not go through this long list because it will take more than the time I have available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought we might have got some indication from Senator Baume about families in his remarks. There was not one issue of substance mentioned about the income of families and what we have done as a government to put into place the social safety net, which only two weeks ago Mr Howard in a press statement dismissed as irrelevant and of no worth or value. That is what he thinks of families. He dismisses the concept of a social net&mdash;the concept of putting a base of income for people in Australia so that they know that no matter what their circumstances are they are guaranteed a certain level of decency in the way they live. Mr Howard dismissed this out of hand in a press statement he put out last week which said that the social wage is of no relevance. That is what he said. </PARA>

This has to be the most outstanding achievement of this government: we have improved the living standards of ordinary Australians substantially and significantly more than any government since federation. It is an achievement that you and your party in government have never been able to match or show any interest in. You want people to be made fearful of their circumstances so therefore they are not able to have the choice, the decency and the dignity in the way they live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's motion then refers to small business; but in his actual remarks there was no mention of policy for small business. This is an absolute policy-free zone in the Liberal Party at the moment&mdash;they have absolutely no policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard's headland speech&mdash;better described as the cape miserable or cape disappointment speech&mdash;two nights ago, disappeared and sunk without trace. I heard the other day that you people had to sit for an hour as Mr Howard droned on about the wonders of the Menzies age and all sorts of other things. But, at the end of it, the speech had nothing in it. While Senator Baume made no mention at all of small business, Mr Howard said, `We will remove government regulation.' He did not say which regulation, just the usual one-liner, `Get rid of regulation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was mention that maybe the FBT and the capital gains tax will be removed by the opposition. That means that $3 billion of revenue will go out the window. Where will you, Senator Baume, raise the extra $3 billion of revenue if you abolish the FBT and the capital gains tax? It means you will either put taxes up somewhere else, or you will cut expenditure to reduce the social safety net, because Mr Howard says it does not matter, it is of no relevance. That is obviously the implication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me get down to the actual issues some small businesses are raising and which have been raised in the debate, such as unconscionable conduct&mdash;an area where we have constitutional power. There was no mention by Mr Howard of his view about that at all. If he is talking about removing regulation, most small businesses in New South Wales, or in the Hunter valley where I have been asked to go to a rally, oppose deregulation of shopping hours. Small business does not want a reduction of regulation in that area; it wants a restriction on shopping hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Mr Howard is running around saying, `Less regulation.' Is that his view? Many small business people in Australia are diametrically opposed to him on that theory. They may be wrong, they may be right. But the point is: he is not telling them in detail what he actually believes. He is not telling them what he wants. He is not telling them what he is going to do. He is saying, `All I want you to do is to hate Paul Keating.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume hates Paul Keating more than any does other senator.

It is going to be the most bereft political policy of any election in Australia. I thought that Andrew Peacock in the 1990 election campaign was pretty bereft of any policy substance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite delighted, Senator Baume, for you and the opposition to be a policy free zone because, when it comes to the crunch, people will not vote on the basis of being purely negative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average rate of economic growth under Mr Howard as Treasurer was 2.6 per cent; under this government, the average was 3.3 per cent.

When Mr Howard left office, the 90-day bank bill rate was 15.9 per cent; the current rate is 7.65 per cent. The next one is a bobby-dazzler&mdash;the highest 90-day bank bill rate under Mr Howard, in April 1992, was 21.65 per cent; the highest 90-day bank bill rate under Labor, in December 1985, was 19.75 per cent.

The unemployment rate when Mr Howard left office was 10 per cent; the current unemployment rate is 8.3 per cent.

You were taken to the cleaners. If there were three horses in the race, you would have come third&mdash;but there can be only two. There is no doubt about the performance when Mr Howard was Treasurer. You  might say this is going back too far, going back 12 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enter this debate as probably one of the very few practising small business people. I acknowledge that farmers and some of the professionals are small business people but, for 20 years, I made a living out of small business. I think I know small business and I think I understand it. I ran a successful small business and employed 10 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that I would have been a casualty of small business in the last 10 years, if I had continued in small business and had not entered politics.

I would have been one of the 14,000 casualties last year and one of the 70,000 casualties over the last four years. That is what has happened to small business. Those are the casualty figures that have been recorded under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said about small business? I can tell Senator Schacht that the remarks the Prime Minister made have incensed small business. He said, `This is as good as it ever gets,' and, `If they are feeling the pinch, they should go back to pay-as-you-earn employment.' I have heard in my travels small business people&mdash;and one in particular comes to mind&mdash;who have voted for the Labor Party all their lives. They have been so incensed by that remark&mdash;obviously, Senator Schacht has heard this&mdash;that they have said that they will never vote for the Labor Party again. the person I had in mind even went on television in his local area and said he wanted to disown the government and that he had completely changed his vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed in Senator Schacht's speech because I do acknowledge that he genuinely tries to help small business but his attack today was negative as he parroted the government's line. The government gave him a piece of paper and he parroted that line. All he did was try to use some figures. But he did not tell us what he was going to do for small business. I do not think that, in the overall scheme of things, Senator Schacht is listened to amongst his cabinet colleagues. If he were, we would not have had interest rates going to 23 per cent. That is an Australian record that the government will hold forever&mdash;23 per cent interest rates on farmers and small business. That is one of the greatest reasons for small businesses perishing in such large numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat those numbers: 70,000 small businesses have gone broke in four years and 14,000 went broke last year. That was the tip of the iceberg. That was just the people who went into bankruptcy and walked away. But many others sold their homes, cashed in their life insurance policies and their superannuation policies, and paid out their debts. Those figures I have just mentioned were the ones for people who had recorded bankruptcies and had gone into receivership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, four or five years ago, I announced the figures and gave them to the press, the heading `Record Bankruptcies in Australia' would be seen on page 1. That went on three months after three months. The casualties grew until everyone accepted that casualties were a fact of life. I certainly acknowledge that running a small business is a high-risk enterprise. It needs a lot of courage to go into small business because the casualty rates are high; but there is no reason for nearly 100,000 businesses to have gone broke in four years. Let us look at some of the reasons they have gone broke. One is the capital gains tax. It might be the final straw. The fringe benefits tax started at $585,000 and has now reached $3 1/2 billion, mainly out of the small business sector.</PARA>

I do not know whether anyone on the government side knows how much damage industrial relations is doing to small business. It is doing enormous damage to small business. I employed 10 people and if I had anyone who was even half good I would try desperately to hold him. No-one ever enjoys having to dismiss an employee. It is not something that anyone wants to do. But there are times in small business&mdash;because of downturns, the loss of a major customer, and many other reasons&mdash;when you have to let staff go. Most times it is done with the greatest reluctance. There is nothing that hurts a small businessman more than having to go in the next morning and tell someone that his services are no longer required because he cannot afford to pay the wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in small business are terrified to put anyone on because they cannot dismiss them. Senator Panizza is nodding his head in agreement. In the last budget we saw company tax rise from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. Senator Schacht said that we should not worry about that; that deals with corporations. He said that that was the big end of town. But 40 per cent of small businesses are incorporated and they are going to have to pay the increased taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax has risen from 15 per cent to 21 per cent and the government tells small business to pass it on. We cannot do that. Every time we put a tax up our sales slide back. When sales are down we have to decide what we are going to do. We have cut everything to the bone so we have to put someone off. Taxes are up and our sales are down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years this government has been a disaster for small business because of high interest rates, increased taxes and a number of other initiatives. The Prime Minister said to small business, `It is as good as it ever gets'. He told them that if they were feeling the pinch they ought to go back to paying tax. It is utter nonsense to think that one can just switch off the light, walk out of one's business or farm and get a job. The Prime Minister should be condemned for his callous approach to small business. He has done immeasurable harm to the small business community and they are not going to let him forget it at the next election. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 29 May this chamber debated tax rates as they affect small business. Yesterday we had a debate about the impact of policy on families. What do we get today? Today we have a rehash of the same ridiculous propositions as were put forward in the previous two debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time wasting exercise demonstrates two fundamental truths about the opposition: firstly, it has no interest in getting on and dealing with the real issues, the real responsibilities that we in this chamber are charged with carrying out; secondly, it has no policies on any important issues that concern and affect the Australian people. All the opposition has is a lot of tired rhetoric which demonstrates its contempt for the welfare of ordinary Australian families and small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht pointed out, this is an opposition whose leader is dismissive of the social wage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, as in so much of the opposition rhetoric, the focus is on revenue. The opposition does not like talking about targeted expenditure, programs designed to create equity, programs designed to produce a fairer society, and programs designed to enhance social justice. But if we concentrate on revenue and tax policy for a moment, we find that the government's record is one of great assistance to small business and families. It is a record that stands in marked contrast to the disgraceful record of the opposition when it was last in government and the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer. Of course, it stands in contrast to the opposition's most recent tax policy&mdash;the discredited GST. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know, Senator Panizza, you do not like being reminded about the economic situation prior to 1993, but I am going to remind you. When John Howard was in charge the top marginal income tax rate was 60 per cent. It is now 47 per cent. When John Howard was Treasurer the bottom marginal tax rate was 30 per cent. It is now 20 per cent. The company tax rate under John Howard was 46 per cent. The Labor government slashed it to 33 per cent. We did that to help restructure this economy to make it more efficient and to get more investment in equipment in Australian industry. We tackled the big issues that Malcolm Fraser and John Howard would never confront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we see these crocodile tears from John Howard about the rate being set at 36 per cent&mdash;still well below the level under John Howard. As the minister has pointed out, government revenue as a proportion of GDP is now lower than it was under John Howard. Housing rates are lower and the average inflation rate since June 1991 has been 1.9 per cent, compared with an inflation rate under John Howard of 9.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, policies in support of families and small business go well beyond simply considering taxation rates. The government has assisted families through wages policy, industry policy, retirement incomes policy, and the development of the social wage. I recall that one of the last acts of the Fraser-Howard government was to impose a freeze on the wages of ordinary taxpayers in this country. That was done at the same time as the wealthy continued to put up their own wages. That was at a time when we had a massive tax avoidance industry in this country. Ordinary taxpayers were subsidising those who had the ability to find ways to avoid paying their fair share of the tax burden. </PARA>

The promise that has probably affected families more than any other is the recent l-a-w/l-i-e promise of tax cuts. That tax cut has also affected the self-funded retirees. They are not going to get anything in superannuation because they do not earn an income. Yet, this government blindly goes on. It promised at the last election not to increase indirect tax, but we have seen wholesale sales tax increase across the board from 20 per cent to 22 per cent as of 1 July.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco tax just happens to have risen by 10 per cent. Did the government tell people prior to the election, `We're not going to increase any indirect taxes but, by the way, we will increase tobacco tax as well'? No, it did not. It simply said, `We're not going to increase any indirect taxes.' Certain bank fees have increased. What does that mean? That simply amounts to a tax on savings. Nothing more, nothing less; just a tax on savings. What we need to realise also is that government spending has increased in this budget to $6.6 billion. What was the election promise? The election promise was an increase of only $5.2 billion over four years. In this budget we have $6.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad reality of all of this is where it really does affect families. We can look, for example, at the fuel tax. At the time of the last election, the fuel tax was 26.2c per litre. By February the following year, it had climbed to 30.75c per litre. I might add that it was 31.75c for leaded fuel and, of course, it is the poorer people who are generally driving cars that run on leaded fuel. Did it matter to this mob? No, it does not matter to this mob that it is hurting more those who can pay for it least. Now fuel tax has reached 32.5c per litre for unleaded fuel and 34.57c per litre for leaded fuel. This is the mob that was not going to increase fuel tax. Did it matter? No. It has just gone up again. What this mob will not understand is the impact right across the board.

I would have to say that if you listened to what some of the senators on the other side of the chamber have had to say, you would have to wonder if this is a battle, because it is certainly going to go off without a bang. Quite clearly, if you look at the policies that they are proposing, you will see there is no comparison; but because there are no policies in the first instance, for the purpose of my contribution to this debate I will have to look back at what the opposition was proposing prior to the last election. Of course, that is one of the very reasons why the opposition is still where it is: in opposition. Its policies on industrial relations in this country were to actually reduce the incomes of Australians&mdash;to pay young people $3 an hour&mdash;let alone worry about any tax that they may have had to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is a very important motion. I am pleased that the Senate has seen fit to bring it on this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the draft bid in its current form will lead to further rounds of expensive and unproductive litigation in the pursuit of clarity and equity. The bill will have major ramifications for many primary production and mining industries. The hardest hit will be those industries in the far outback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in this bill to the diesel fuel rebate scheme will be retrospective to 1 August 1986. The amendment could well result in endless conflict. Many payments for rebate have been made under judicial and quasi-judicial interpretation. As a result, many people may find that they will be asked to repay rebates that have been approved and received under the rulings of the day. Conversely, some companies have incurred significant costs in pursuing challenges to interpretations only to find that, after considerable financial outlay, this reprehensible retrospective action has changed or will destroy their case. It is an action that Senator Barney Cooney, as a lawyer, would find most reprehensible. I ask him to plead my case before his caucus colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Business Council of Australia entered the fray over the government's attempts to retrospectively amend the diesel fuel rebate legislation, describing the move as outrageous. I agree with those sentiments. The issue involves the provisions that the government intends to restrict the conditions under which the rebate would be paid retrospectively to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian citizens and companies should not be denied the right to rely on the law as enacted by the parliament and the court's interpretation of that law. It is argued that the move will raise the perception internationally of `sovereign risk' in Australia. We have had too many cases in this country where the government has jeopardised constantly before the law or introduced the concept of sovereign risk. This is very damaging to Australia's international reputation, particularly when investors are seeking international funds for investment in essential mining industries for Australia. Essentially the outback will be attacked. This concept of sovereign risk cannot lightly be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other proposed changes do not encourage or support the efficient use of subcontractors either within primary industry or the mining industries. It would appear from the particular wording at this early stage that they may well be targeted and at risk. This concern needs clarifying. As one having some interest in contract fertiliser lime spreading, I shudder to think of the cost ramifications or the impact on this industry if the government were to take the rebate retrospectively, and even if they were to apply prospectively the effects the change could have on the efficiency of both mining and agriculture. It may well be a further attempt by this government to attack independent contractors who are used increasingly by both mining and primary production sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes to the eligibility criteria have the potential for an extensive and probably unintended impact on the mining industry. These implications, which are embodied in the proposed legislation and arising from the budget, will add significantly to the cost of legitimate mining operations, an export industry that should not be taxed. After all, we had an election about a GST. A GST was about taking costs off industry, particularly off exports. Only a year or two away from that election, the government introduces changes which will add costs to export industries in the form of the withdrawal of diesel rebates. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me take this further. It will add significantly to the cost of legitimate mining operations. The amendments to the definition of mineral sand excludes sand mining, yet there are numerous examples where sand is extracted for the purpose of recovering minerals. The bill's current wording makes sand mining&mdash;a legitimate mining operation&mdash;ineligible as well. This ambiguity must be clarified. With the removal of the so-called sleeper clause, it is now unclear as to whether activities associated with mining, such as generation of power to light a mine site or the removal of earth to access ore bodies, will be covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that a hole has been created in the eligibility criteria for the rebate between the conclusion of exploration activities and the commencement of mining. The scope of the term `dressing' used under the bill is still unclear. The term `treatment', which is more commonly used in the industry, should be taken to be interchangeable with the word `dressing', and this definition should be made clear in the legislation. This bill is opening up a whole new problem of definitions and lack of clarity which will be detrimental to the industry. In the past, such definitions have been made clear by quasi judicial interpretation, by rulings of the day, and this will be destroyed by reprehensible retrospective legislation. What confidence can business have in this government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diesel fuel use in the transporting of minerals to a treatment or beneficiation site is rebatable. In fact, AMEC believes this provision should be extended to include the return journeys by transporters where the trucks are empty or back loaded. The transport of other raw materials used in the treatment of beneficiation is not covered. This forms a vital part of this process and therefore should be included in the rebate. The  diesel fuel rebate available for rehabilitation will, as a result of the proposed changes, be limited to the rehabilitation of mining sites only. A great deal of expenditure is incurred in rehabilitation. Those honourable senators opposite are supposed to be interested in the environment. I remind the Senate that a lot of expenditure will be incurred in rehabilitation areas used to contain tailings resulting from the beneficiation process, and these sites should be made eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diesel fuel rebate will be limited to the pumping of water where the pumping is carried on or adjoining the place where the exploration prospecting mining is conducted. Amendments will therefore exclude situations where the pumping of water is carried out at remote bore fields. You cannot necessarily find water immediately adjacent to your site, and you have to bring it in. This will have the effect of denying those sorts of costs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will include situations where the pumping of water is carried on in remote bore fields located some distance from the mine site, thereby increasing the cost to the miner. The diesel fuel rebate may well only be available for the construction or maintenance of access roads and storage dams and only where it is carried on at the actual place where the mining takes place, not the adjacent site which is necessary and incidental to the purpose of mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been proposed that the diesel fuel purchased for use in the generation of electricity for a mining town is eligible to receive a rebate. It appears that the new definition will deny a rebate for diesel fuel used in the generation of electricity for all mining towns, particularly those located in Western Australia. The rebate is limited to circumstances where the service, maintenance or repair of vehicles, plant and equipment for use in mineral exploration, prospecting or subsequent treatment of minerals are carried out at the actual place where the mining operation takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new residential provisions will deny a rebate where the diesel fuel is used for electricity generations for residential purposes at a place other than where the mining operations are conducted or at a place adjoining the mine. I urge the maximum numbers of my colleagues to participate in this debate. I conclude by saying that these measures, particularly the retrospective changes to the diesel fuel rebate, are reprehensible, a denial of natural justice and must be overturned. I call upon all reasonable members of the  Labor Party to ensure that this takes place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to Senator Watson's comments, they are totally incorrect. Retrospectivity, as I understand it, essentially deals with companies and/or persons who have not claimed. The retrospectivity in terms of a court judgment or a payment that has been made under the existing arrangements will continue to be made and maintained. Senator Watson said that the mining of sand for the purposes of mineral extraction would not be entitled to the rebate. That is wrong. Mining sands for the purpose of extracting minerals will continue to be paid the rebate. Sand mining for the purposes of making it into concrete or whatever will not be eligible. It never was eligible. In terms of return journeys where trucks are taking minerals or rocks to be processed further in the beneficiation and away from the mine site, they will be counted, regardless of whether it goes outside of the boundary of the mining pit or the specific mine site. They will still be able to count that as part of their claim in terms of the rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to boring for water, I think honourable senators will find that, regardless of whether it is 50 kilometres away, providing the water is being bored and pumped for a specific mining purpose, the rebate will be able to be claimed. In terms of the electricity generation, towns that are outside the normal control of local government&mdash;where there are no local government power supplies, et cetera&mdash;or mining towns that provide their own power generation, will be able to claim the fuel for that power generation under the rebate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy was saying that carting material to the treatment plant is rebatable for extraction of minerals. That is well spelt out in the legislation. But nowhere in the legislation does it say that the return journey is covered. Senator Sherry and Senator Murphy can say what they like, but it is there. If they interpret the law as it reads and if this legislation sees the light of day, they will see that that is correct. We may have different ideas for the legislation. We will make sure that the return journey is also covered and is set out in black and white. I will come back to those points later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that if this government has abused a tax revenue in this place, this is the one that it has abused the most. Since 1983 this dishonest government has turned the diesel fuel levy into a levy for roads. It started long before 1983 and it started long before 1973. In fact, it started in March 1956 when it was 2.108c per litre. The reason why it is an odd figure is because we were dealing with pence per gallon in those days. That is the conversion. That is the reason why this diesel fuel levy was introduced. There was always a levy on petrol but as the years went by the useage of petrol fell and the useage of diesel increased heavily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of the day&mdash;the Menzies government in 1956&mdash;imposed a levy on road funding. I believe that was a capital idea. Any fuel that was used off-road was rebatable. It does not matter what it was used for in those days&mdash;whether it was used for fishing, farming, mining or power generation&mdash;it was rebatable. That is the concept of the beginning of the diesel fuel levy for roads. Those who were around at the time can see how the road system improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did this government do? The fuel levy system hardly changed from 1956 to 1983 when the Fraser government lost power. As soon as this government came in it changed the whole concept. It turned it into a full taxing system rather than having the gumption to do otherwise. </PARA>

I do not know what option A or option B was; I did not read too much about what the Labor Party was doing. I believe that option C related to a consumption tax&mdash;a goods and services tax. I believe that Mr Keating was rolled on it at the time. He was very much in favour of it. The odd West Australian friend I have in the Labor Party&mdash;the former Western Australian minister for transport, Julian Grill&mdash;was over here for it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fuel levy or taxation system raises about $3 billion a year. If I am wrong someone can correct me but I think I am right in that regard. So a quarter of that is $750 million. This government gets $750 million in the form of an interest-free loan from farmers, contractors and miners. But when they draw up the budget papers they always show the diesel fuel rebate figure as a debt&mdash;forgone income. Yet it should not be there in the first place. Anyone else who is my age may remember that when the diesel fuel levy was introduced you had an exemption certificate, which meant you did not pay the levy in the first place. But for some reason or other that system was changed&mdash;I do not know which government changed it&mdash;so that you had to pay it and get it back.

I do not remember which team won, but just imagine shifting the goalposts 10 years later and saying, `No, they didn't kick those goals, we'll take their premiership off them.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Morally, I did not support it but practically I would have had to support it. They made a big deal about that and it only related to $80 million. This piece of retrospective legislation will be the reverse. The government is going to grab $130 million that does not legally belong to it. That is how great this problem is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us return to the mining system. Senator Watson and I have said that the government is shifting the goalposts so that where people were able to claim the fuel rebate, now they will not be able to do so. So the costs of mining will increase. I am not talking so much about gold now because gold can be sold at just about any time but, of course, the margin will be less and less and some of the marginal mines may have to close. We will lose our competitive edge with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a few figures as to what has been raised under this system, going back to when this government came into office in 1983. If I remember correctly, about 7c a litre was being raised on diesel fuel. It is now 33c a litre and rising every year according to indexation. It must be remembered that that legislation was introduced in order to provide money to fix roads. You would reckon that because this system has gone on for so long we would have the best road system in the world, but I am afraid our road system, as everyone who does a lot of outback driving knows, is going backwards. Some of the states, such as New South Wales, have had to introduce an extra levy of 4c a litre. Western Australia did that later. With regard to the record amount of 33c a litre that the government is raising, only about 7c is going back into roads, and the rest is simply going into government coffers. It is going to raise more from the mining industry as well by changing the goalposts. I have told the Senate about that when I was responding to some of the points made by Senator Murphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the farming scene. Fortunately, off-road costs are rebated, and so they should be. But now the goalposts have been shifted there. There are a lot of farmers, especially smaller farmers, who use contractors to do work on their farm. Typical work would be shifting stock. Although not too much travelling is done on farm in shifting stock, on a pastoral station you can do up to 300 kilometres or 400 kilometres off-road. It would be nothing for a contractor on one of the massive stations that we have in the north of Western Australia, in the Kimberley region, to do 500 kilometres on those ungazetted roads, and that section done by the contractor will be liable for payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a 1,500 kilometre journey, a fuel levy would have been paid on about 1,000 kilometres; now they will be paying the levy on the whole 1,500 kilometres. The reverse applies when the truck comes back for the second load. Farmers will be paying both ways, so it is not just 500 kilometres that will be added on, it is an extra 1,000 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One type of work done on farms is crop spraying. Anyone who has been around a farming operation in May or June would have seen a lot of crops in the ground; it is a very busy, intensive season. Ideally, the season is squeezed into less than five weeks, and you cannot do everything in that time&mdash;especially these days with the sort of legislation that this government brought in about unfair dismissal. As a fellow in business myself, I am very serious about this. You do not want to put employees off, especially ones who perform, but you are frightened to put extra people on, even at seeding time&mdash;or at harvesting, but that is not so much a problem because not so many people are needed&mdash;because you have got to put them off at the end. They ask, `Why am I being put off?', even though you have told them that it will be five, six, seven, eight or 10 weeks' work. So then you use spraying contractors who use a boom spray in a Landcruiser four-wheel drive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, any fuel used for contract spraying was rebatable. If you used your own tractor, it was rebatable. Senator Sherry, if you put a contractor on now, according to your new legislation, the fuel is not going to be rebatable. So the cost of that cropping will go up once again&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Sandy Macdonald will comment on that when he speaks in this debate, because he is a very successful farmer in New South Wales. That is the situation. Where once contractors' fuel was rebatable, now it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the reason that has been given? The best reason from the government, or any government adviser, is that a contractor might use some of that fuel on the road. What a ridiculous, stupid argument that is. There are always grey areas that this government could look at where things are not done right rather than the minimal use contractors may have on roads. The government should look at the converse of that in that a contractor coming onto the farm for the first time may have tax-paid fuel in his tank which he uses. The government has used a very weak and stupid argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both farming and mining are going to suffer very badly and I believe that the government should be condemned for it. I have now covered my points and the points that Senator Murphy has raised. We will have a good chance to debate the legislation when it comes&mdash;if it ever comes, with the way the government is managing the business this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support Senator Watson in his motion, which deplores the proposed amendments to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and which would be retrospective to 1 August 1986. Senator Watson is a tax expert. He is recognised on both sides of the Senate as somebody with an excellent working knowledge of tax. He is really taking the opportunity to flag a problem that has been brought to the attention of the government with this legislation that has been proposed in the budget. The government knows that there is very considerable doubt about the application of the retrospective nature of the legislation. It is time that it realised the problem, and this is an opportunity for it to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with interest to my colleague Senator Panizza who also has a very good working knowledge of tax, the way it is administered and the effect that it has on business operations. It would be in the government's interests to take note of what he said. I also listened with interest to Senator Murphy. I always listen with interest to what Senator Murphy has to say because he is rather unique in the 1990s Labor Party in that he actually has done a physical day's work in his life. He might not have a lot of experience about running a business, but we do welcome his support&mdash;limited though it was&mdash;in looking at what the budget proposals are, and we look forward to his having some influence on his colleagues in perhaps changing the budget legislation before it comes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is committed to a fair deal for the mining industry. For that reason, we will be opposing these changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme announced in the budget, particularly the proposal to abolish the rebate for mining sandstone, sand, clay and granite and some other extracted materials for the nine years retrospective to 1986. I want to reiterate that: it is retrospective. You do not introduce retrospective legislation without a great deal of thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also oppose the abolition of the rebate currently allowed for mining-related activities. These include rehabilitation of mining operations. For my area of the Hunter Valley, this could be very damaging and environmentally irresponsible. The Hunter Valley is an incredibly productive coalmining area. It is essentially a very beautiful part of Australia. It is part of the economic powerhouse of the nation, and it has a terrific ability to provide a support backup in tourism for the Olympic Games in the year 2000. Its wine industry is unparalleled. The same goes for mining, heavy industry and farming. The effects of mining do require a large amount of rehabilitation, and the removal of the diesel fuel rebate would be very unwise in terms of environmental responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the rebate also affects mining related transport activities and the pumping of water, which is essential for mining and for primary production. If it were extended to primary production, it would be very unsatisfactory. Electricity generation is also included. It would be an additional cost to regional consumers in out-of-the-way places where diesel has to be used because diesel is the only means of generation. The mining and related sector stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the removal of the rebate amounts to increasing the tax on intermediate business input. Worst still, the government's attempt to retrospectively increase taxes is a disturbing indication of its attitude towards business. The BCA yesterday entered the fray. It described the proposed actions as outrageous. All I can say to the BCA is that it has to be very careful about what it says to this Labor government because it runs the severe risk of being shut out, which is in line with the authoritarian nature of the government's approach to business people who are not too friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with this federal Labor government&mdash;and I see that the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) has come into the chamber&mdash;is that despite its protestations it is just not sympathetic to business. It is not sympathetic to the way business operates. It is not sympathetic, and it does not have an understanding of the difficulty business faces in meeting budgets. It certainly does not understand the climate of uncertainty that this sort of retrospective legislation has. The trouble is that, in the main, the people making decisions in the government have never been in business themselves. That is not the be all and end all&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I know. In generosity to Senator Schacht, he has shown some sympathy to small business. Because of the pressure being brought on him and others by the BCA, I am sure he is aware of the problem. He has the chance to make some changes between now and when the budget papers come in. Clearly, this is just a blatant move to increase revenue. It is a tax on primary production. It is a tax on exports at a time when we need the export dollars. As I have indicated, in terms of the Hunter Valley, it is a tax on the rehabilitation of mining land and it is a tax on greening. That cannot be very satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have to remind those opposite that there are over 700,000 children living in families in which neither parent has a job. There are now 1.2 million Australian families in which no family member&mdash;parent or child&mdash;is employed. And still this Labor government persists with policies&mdash;not just the ones we are talking about here&mdash;that are a deterrent to business investment. We all know that business investment equals jobs for Australians. Profit and reward for taking a risk is a concept those in the government have some difficulty in coming to terms with. Labor policies are creating uncertainty and concern about the future and undermining the confidence needed to invest. Labor's industrial relations laws, which serve to increase the power of its mates in the ACTU, limit the opportunity to increase productivity and therefore increase business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry stands to lose at least $100 million from this legislation because of this government's poorly drafted eligibility provisions in the original diesel rebate scheme. Coupled with this, the government has done nothing to fix the legislation for nine long years. The government has now rightly drawn widespread condemnation for what is essentially a revenue grab from industry. This comes on top of the extra 3c company tax in the budget that Labor slugged Australian business with. This government is the original Indian giver; it gave in the 1993 campaign and now it takes away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These retrospective changes will reduce the eligibility of some mining activities and will abolish the rebate for mining of sandstone, sand, clay, granite and other materials. The government has had many opportunities to clarify the operation of the scheme in the past. The government cannot rely on illegality or fraud to justify its heavy-handed approach. There has been no wrongdoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes the government's legislation even more offensive is the fact that it discriminates against claimants according to the stage of their legal proceedings. Companies that have received a rebate contrary to the proposed changes will not have to repay it, but those currently contesting claims lose their right to proceed. Industry has a fundamental right to seek clarification of any legislation and the right to complete current cases is part of the very essence of our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this move could also raise a perception internationally that sovereign risk in Australia is increasing. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you well know, sovereign risk is an old principle that laws cannot bind the sovereign. Therefore, questions of fairness and what is proper do not apply if the sovereign chooses to change his or her mind. The government, by taking a stand on sovereign risk&mdash;in other words, changing its mind after business has made up its mind on existing rebate arrangements&mdash;risks being seen as irresponsible and Australia runs the risk of being seen as an unsatisfactory place to do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have been a capital importing nation for almost all of our history, and will be for the foreseeable future, this decision should not be taken lightly. As my colleague Senator Watson pointed out, certainty before the law is essential. Retrospectivity is not an approach to be taken without considerable thought and, basically, it is summed up as a complete denial of natural justice. The government's ineptitude has meant that industry has had to expend a considerable sum of money to challenge the interpretations of the provisions, only to have its case destroyed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another disturbing aspect of this legislation is the government's attempt to distinguish between mining and quarrying industries. The operations involved in quarrying are identical to those carried out in open-cut mining, and they will continue to receive a rebate. There is no reason why some extractive industries would be provided with a diesel fuel rebate and others excluded, apart from the government's grab for revenue. The whole episode typifies this government's anti-industry approach. With this, in concert with its refusal to deregulate the labour market and to make the waterfront fully competitive, it is no wonder business is looking to pack up and move offshore. It is voting with its feet. </PARA>

I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of the scheme that has grown rapidly is the mining industry because of the growth of mining in Australia. The mining industry claims are going up maybe $80 million to $100 million a year, not just because of excise itself going up but because many more mines are coming in, which is good and no-one disputes that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson interjects, `Why should it be placed on export industries?' One of the rationales, I am told, that the Fraser government used to justify the diesel fuel rebate scheme was that this was a concession to the mining and primary exporting industries because they had to pay high input costs due to high tariffs, high protection, in Australia. And that is perfectly true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would point out to senators opposite that since that time average tariffs in Australia have dropped from around 25 per cent to between five per cent and 10 per cent. We have also introduced a much broadened area of tariff concession orders. Finally, there are policy by-laws for major mining industry projects. All of this means the industry is paying less tariff than it ever has before for its inputs. Nevertheless, that was a justification for it&mdash;Senator Watson is dead right about that. But you now say that this industry is no longer paying anywhere near the same level of tariffs that it was in 1982 because of our policy of reducing tariffs. Therefore, the input costs are down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the senator that manufacturing exports have gone up substantially as well. Many exporting manufacturers do not use diesel fuel in their production. They are exporting for the benefit of Australia and they do not get access to the diesel fuel rebate scheme even though manufactures, I think, are now running well over $20 billion a year in exports. The Fraser government introduced the scheme specifically for the mining extraction industry where minerals would be extracted from the ore out of the ground and for primary production. It was those definitions that the Fraser government introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then people have found, by appeal, that they can widen the definition. These definitions have expanded the eligibility. In the concern of senators for the agricultural and mining industries, which I accept&mdash;I have the same concern&mdash;they cannot tell me that when the Fraser government introduced the scheme, it did so to help local government bodies in the maintenance of parks and gardens in municipal areas. That is not a mining industry. That is not a primary production exporting industry. It is the maintenance of parks and gardens. </PARA>

Last week the AAT in Perth decided, on application, that the Water Authority of Western Australia was eligible for rebate of customs or excise duty paid on the diesel fuel it used to pump ground water for treatment and supply to townships such as Port Hedland and South Hedland. The tribunal's decision was on the basis that the WAWA was carrying out a mining operation which was eligible for rebate under the diesel fuel rebate scheme. If this stands it will mean that any householder with a backyard water bore used for any purpose will be eligible to claim, legally, the diesel fuel rebate, because the court has ruled that extracting water out of the ground is a mining operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. That is what you think. That is not the way the court has ruled. That means that anybody who has a bore in the background and it has a diesel pump attached to it, using it for whatever purpose they like, can claim the diesel fuel rebate. That has been happening for the last decade or more. I have to say quite bluntly&mdash;I said it in the press statement&mdash;these are astonishing decisions beyond the commonsense application of what ordinary citizens would believe a mining or agricultural related industry is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the opposition: if you do not watch out&mdash;whether you are in government or we are in government&mdash;if you allow a scheme that was specifically designed, as Senator Watson said, for export mining and export agricultural industries to be extended so that basically anybody who uses diesel anywhere off road gets the rebate, you are going to blow this scheme out of the water in the end. You are going to rock the scheme so far away from its original purpose that it will collapse, because people will say that it is being rorted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give Senator Watson another example. There is a category under the scheme called residential. A few months after I became customs minister responsible for administering this scheme, I discovered that, under this category of residential, a very senior public servant in an urban area of Canberra who had diesel heating in his home was getting the diesel fuel rebate every month because it was off road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You misunderstand again. The legislation says he is eligible. What we are doing in this legislation is removing most of those categories. When you were in government you never wanted residential people who were in no way connected with mining or agricultural export industries to claim the diesel fuel rebate. We are closing that loophole. The diesel fuel rebate is available for those defined industries&mdash;mining or primary industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given a couple of examples of court rulings. The final one relates to a claim that was approved by the AAT. We opposed it, and we will appeal it. It relates to the Cowell electricity supply company on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, my home state. That company has a diesel generator to produce electricity for the surrounding area. It has been ruled that, as it connects electricity to farms around Cowell, the Cowell supply company can claim the diesel fuel rebate because it is somehow connected to agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this is getting out of hand. This is not what the scheme was designed for. Two years ago I attempted&mdash;and the Senate rejected it&mdash;to put a limit on how far back people could go to claim. That was in 1993. I remember people saying, `If you get evidence that people out there are trying to encourage other people to lodge back claims as a result of the change of eligibility because of the decision of the AAT, you show us.' In the estimates committee the other day I tabled a letter from the New South Wales Golf Association telling everybody to get into it and pointing out that, if they were successful in this appeal, Ernst and Young, the accountants, would do all the work for them as long as Ernst and Young got a 25 per cent success fee of whatever was paid to them. That is in the letter I tabled in the estimates committee the other day. We are trying to refine the scheme back to its original intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of all that, I express amazement that members of the opposition, leading up to the budget, made strong and powerful speeches about reducing government expenditure, getting the deficit down and getting it into surplus as soon as possible. That was raised by every senior spokesperson for the coalition. It was also the main thrust of the recommendations of the Business Council of Australia. It made major recommendations that we slash government expenditure everywhere, get the deficit down and get it into surplus. The government achieved that by reducing government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way in which we did that was by redefining the original intent of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. By that means we were able to reduce expenditure. The people in the mining and primary industry sectors who were eligible for the diesel fuel rebate would still get it. We cut out the broader applications which the court had allowed, not what the government had intended. We also made sure that all the consultants and accounting firms which were sending out circulars telling people to claim back to 1986, if they got a favourable court decision, were eliminated; so that this money is not spent, thus reducing the deficit and helping us to get it into surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we did this we were attacked by the opposition. The opposition said that this was terrible. There is a bit of hypocrisy here. At one stage the opposition was screaming out for reduced expenditure. When the government takes on the task and, in a very select and proper way, maintains the policy intent of the legislation which the Fraser government introduced, we get abused because we are not reducing it for the mining industry or for the mainstream primary industry sector. We are eliminating it for all those who should not be in the scheme. It was never the policy intent that they get it. We are stopping if for those who, by a favourable decision that could come in the next year or so&mdash;we are now wiping that out&mdash;could automatically claim back to 1986. They could claim back nine years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we estimated what we would save by having this clause which would stop those claims going back to 1986, the figure was around $70 million. That was what we thought we would be able to save if we stopped claims all the way back to 1986. Since then, because of the publicity and the flood of claims coming in, driven by the consultants, we now believe the figure is $160 million to $170 million. In a month, extra claims totalling $100 million have come in. All up, $170 million will be claimed if all these court cases are decided in favour of the consultants and their clients. That $170 million comes off the budget surplus. That is a 20 per cent reduction in the budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BCA and the opposition were saying, `You must get the budget into surplus. You must get a bigger surplus.' Today you are telling us you are going to vote to allow the retrospectivity back to 1986 so that persons who were never intended to be able to claim the rebate will get it. They would walk off with a $170 million windfall, which is not going to affect the previous operations of the scheme. They have already been conducted. They did not think they were eligible until a smart consultant found a way around and appealed to the AAT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have not; and that is what we are cranky about. At present, the diesel fuel rebate for farmers is about 32 1/2c per litre. You are expecting to recoup some $3.9 billion from diesel excise alone in 1995-96&mdash;that should be noted&mdash;an increase of nine per cent on the previous year. With the scheme we have been operating under, eligible primary producers receive a rebate of some 32 1/2c per litre while eligible mining operations receive a rebate of 30.1 cents per litre. Effectively, they pay an excise of 2.4 cents per litre. Other rebatable users receive a rebate of 24.8 cents a litre. Effectively, they pay 7.8 cents per litre. Where the government is going wrong is that retrospectivity is required to limit the liability to piggyback claims and other claims that have been made. I know you are having a ding-dong with Senator Watson at the moment, Senator Schacht, and I am sure that Senator Watson, when he sums up, will give you a couple back. That will come a bit later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims arise as a result of decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court which have broadened the scope of eligible rebatable activities beyond what was originally intended. We understand that on this side of the chamber. But we still say that we do not like the retrospectivity. We do not like the fact that on budget night the government indicated that it was not going to interfere with the diesel fuel rebate. But it has. Those are two areas where we disagree with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other points to consider. There is no doubt that revenue is the prime motive behind this. To get a budget surplus the government has to sell off half the farm. The government is selling off the front paddock this time, not the back paddock. The government has sold off a little of the family silver as well. The government has done this to get itself into a position where it has a rather small surplus. It is a funky budget. It has been fudged the whole way through, and this is another part of the fudge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is into revenue raising. The government is not trying to fix up the scheme as much as it is trying to raise more revenue. The minister has delivered his dissertation but I do not know that I am wiser now than I was before he started. The bill is going to overturn several decisions of the AAT and the courts to the financial disadvantage of claimants. It is going to be pretty difficult for a lot of claimants. It is going to abort other decisions in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies have gone to considerable expense to contest decisions in the AAT and the courts. Those decisions will be overturned by this legislation. As Senator Watson says, this legislation is not in the right direction. I believe it would have been appropriate to follow the convention of limiting retrospectivity back to budget night&mdash;not back nine years. That point has been made by Senator Panizza, Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Watson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody minds the retrospectivity going back to budget night. We feel that that would be quite right and just, and it is the convention. To take it back nine years will cause problems. It was the government's legislation that set this in place. It is not as if somebody has done the wrong thing. In administering the scheme the government has been doing the wrong thing and it is now going to make it retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of areas that concern me as a person from the agricultural sector. I know that these same matters worry Senator Panizza and Senator Sandy Macdonald. We have the list of amendments and we see the rebate relating to mining and agriculture.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on record some of the questions I would like to ask.

What about the planting or tending of trees for windbreaks? That has nothing to do with the growing of a crop and it is not tied up with the soil. Is that going to be subject to the diesel fuel rebate? What about the farming of fish, shellfish and other crustaceans; is that going to be eligible for a diesel fuel rebate?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask another question, Madam Acting Deputy President, through you. What about the carting of fodder from a paddock to a place of storage, or from storage to a place where it can be fed to livestock? What is going to happen there in relation to the diesel fuel excise in that instance? It is not in the terms of the legislation which reads, `Restricted to diesel fuel purchased for use in preparation of the soil, the act of growing primary produce, or rearing of livestock or other connected activity.' We would like to know whether or not those other connected activities are applicable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the spreading of fertiliser on the farm? Is it all right? If it is done in the local park is it not all right?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We should have clear and unambiguous legislation put before this chamber. We have not seen it yet. At this stage of the debate we are deploring the absolute hypocrisy of the government. On budget night the government said that it would not touch the diesel fuel excise. We have only to remember all those things that we saw in the newspapers about the diesel fuel rebate being scrapped. There was a figment of truth in that, I suppose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to budget night and we are told, `No, nothing is going to be done to the fuel excise rebate. It is all under control.' Then there was the sleight of hand&mdash;another, very slight, sleight of hand&mdash;and it was made retrospective. Retrospectivity back to 1 August 1986? Dear, oh dear, that is a long time, isn't it? How long has this government been in power?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to that very foolish interjection from the parliamentary secretary. The point is that the people out there are now saying, `This government has been there too long. It's time for a change. It's time to get rid of this Labor Party that has ruled Australia for the last 13 years. It has dragged us to our knees. It has given us a balance of payments on the current account, which is running at about $2 billion a month. It has given us a foreign debt that is getting up towards $200 billion. It has given us an economy that cannot even keep up with New Zealand now; New Zealand has outstripped Australia.' Parliamentary Secretary, it is an absolutely ridiculous remark that the government has not had long enough. The Australian people, I can tell you, have actually had you, and they do not want you any longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is really about retrospectivity and the clarity of the definition of `agriculture' in this bill. So I fully support Senator Watson and his motion before the chamber tonight. The fact is that the government does stand condemned. It does things that we deplore, and we deplore the things it will be doing with this legislation in the future. I will let Senator Watson speak now because I know he wants to say something about what Senator Schacht has been earbashing us with for a while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I admit that it is somewhat unusual for me to introduce a motion impacting on a bill which is yet to be debated in this chamber, but we do have some rather unusual circumstances in that the bill significantly widens the scope of what was outlined in the budget. Since my contribution and Senator Schacht's contribution on this motion, he has spoken to me. It would appear that the government is prepared to go back and have discussions with the genuine parts of the industry&mdash;mining and agriculture&mdash;and speak with those peak bodies who feel that they may be disadvantaged as a result of the scope of this legislation, to ensure that its so-called ambiguities are removed. I certainly welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my colleagues&mdash;Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Brownhill, Senator Panizza&mdash;for their contributions in this debate today. As Senator Brownhill said, it is the responsibility of this parliament to ensure that we have clear, unambiguous legislation which is carefully targeted to a particular area of need. However, Senator Schacht's contribution reflected the fact that his department has been somewhat negligent in the manner in which the government has been administering this scheme. When we were talking about it, it was never intended to cover such things as golf courses and so on. I agree with him. These sorts of rorts, if they are alleged rorts, have to be targeted and eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best legislation, of course, is to ensure that, whenever abuse is around, it should be picked up easily; it should not be allowed to be tolerated year after year and then be covered by retrospective legislation. This is quite reprehensible and really demeans the value of law so far as taxpayers and clients are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up in this debate on my motion, I believe we can do no better than look at the summary of concerns from the minerals council of Australia. It sees the bill not as a carefully worded attempt to remove any ambiguity&mdash;and I think that was the thrust of my contribution&mdash;as to the ambit of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, but to more effectively target the scheme to those who are genuinely involved in the business of mining operations and, I also add, primary production operations. It is a thinly veiled attempt to restrict the diesel fuel excise rebate being paid for diesel used in actual mining and in genuine primary operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that the passage of the draft bill, as it is at the moment, will create significant uncertainty about the eligibility of a number of activities central to the activity of mining operations as defined in subparagraphs 8(a) and (b). We had contributions from Senator Murphy and the minister, Senator Schacht, who said, `Well, this is not intended.' I say that you now have an excellent opportunity to go back to redraft or amend those sections of the legislation which have given rise to our concerns about the scope of what is intended. Don't use a sledgehammer to attack the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing legislation, designed to be written off by the retrospective application contained in this bill, will be replaced by a new round of litigation which would be forced on mining operations in relation to central aspects of the rebate for actual mining operations. I am talking about actual mining operations; I am not talking about golf courses. So let us focus on the legitimate areas of activity which are going to get picked up by the very wide scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the contributions today, it is quite obvious that there is uncertainty. The minister said to me, `If there is uncertainty, I am prepared to look at it and to change it.' I welcome that, and I believe that we are going to get something very constructive out of this debate which could well affect the final outcome if the government does its job and listens to the industry and makes the necessary arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the bill is not consistent with statements contained in the explanatory memorandum. This is always very dangerous because a lot of us have difficulty reading bills per se. We go to the explanatory memorandum and we rely on that as to the bill's meaning, intent and coverage. So we have a situation where the bill is not consistent with the statements contained in the explanatory memorandum, with the application of the new definitions being significantly more restrictive and with greater financial implications than those suggested in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a legitimate activity for the Senate to embark upon at this time because we know the legislation is going to get rammed through later when there is a minimum amount of time to discuss it. What we are doing through this motion is warning the government. We are giving the government time to get it right and to make sure that the explanatory memorandum agrees with the bill, but if the bill is wrong, to fix it up in accordance with the undertakings given in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Acts Interpretation Act, courts only go to the explanatory memorandum when the bill is unclear. If the courts believe the bill is clear as to its intent, they do not then go to the explanatory memorandum or to the undertakings given in this chamber in second reading speeches or at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central responsibility of all legislators in this place is to carefully look at any legislation that has retrospective application. I believe that this is what I have done through this motion and I stand by it. I would welcome the government's preparedness to look at the particular areas of concern that the NFF, the Minerals Council and other genuine bodies have in relation to these measures. We will make up our minds accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA>This motion condemns the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, for his bone-headed decision to leave out two hundred farm families from exceptional circumstances assistance in the Upper Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this chamber is aware, this matter has had a very long and sad history, particularly for the people in the Upper Hunter. Australia has been in the grip of drought for the last four years. We have had a situation right across the country where slowly, year by year, people on farms and in the towns that supply those farms have got into a bad and worsening situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something about drought that makes it very different from other natural disasters that afflict us. With a cyclone, like Cyclone Tracy, you automatically respond because it is such a dramatic event. With bushfires, people rush to the rescue because they are such dramatic events. But droughts are not dramatic; they creep up on a country very slowly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, where 80 per cent of the country is urbanised, the majority of the population hardly even notices drought. One of the tragedies of this drought, which is probably the worst drought this century, is that it seems as though the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government did not notice that it was upon us. It was only in the early part of last year that the Prime Minister finally got out of the city and into the drought country and saw what was happening. But even then he was very slow to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably more tragic for the farm people was that the federal government department that is responsible for rural matters&mdash;the Department of Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;was so incredibly slow to do anything about the drought and come up with systems of assistance that were fair, equitable and, more importantly, timely. We had a minister who finally decided in the third year of the drought that he might do something about it last August. I asked a question of him in the chamber at this time. What was his policy? What was he going to do if the drought continued until December, February or the winter plantings in April this year? He did not really have a response to that. His policy back then was that he really hoped it would rain next week and that that would solve the problem for him. The rains did not come by December. By February, there was some rain across Australia. Indeed, by April there had been some rain across Australia. This has given people in the cities a false sense that the drought has broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A break in a drought does not mean that there is a sudden downpour that provides enough water so that it will be all right next week. It is not like that at all. When there are sudden downpours after a drought, most of the water seeps into the ground. Many areas have told me that, after those rains in January, they did not have any water in the dams. Even though there have been some good rains in many areas of Australia, there was not enough rain to break the drought. Many areas of Australia are still in the grip of drought. Quite a number of areas are in the grip of extreme drought circumstances. This brings me to the current plight of the Hunter Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, when the government finally got its act together and decided that, under RASAC, it would allow farmers and regions to apply for drought assistance, the Upper Hunter, which is the subject of this motion, continually missed out. It has been a great mystery to people in the Upper Hunter why this government constantly has left them out. Many people have the theory that the Upper Hunter is not in a marginal seat. Areas that seemed less deserving got the extreme drought assistance, and they did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The surprise in their not getting it was reflected in the fact that the state government&mdash;the body that really knows what is happening in the drought affected areas; it really has the rural counsellors on the ground to advise&mdash;put the Upper Hunter very high up on the list. They were sixth on a list of about 14. When the federal government funded the extreme drought circumstances, it jumped straight past the Upper Hunter and included a number of other areas lower down the list. Again, it is just a huge mystery why the Upper Hunter was left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason seems to be that the way in which RASAC was determining who got in and who was left out was very shonky. It was taking annual rainfall figures. It was not taking into account the distribution of that rainfall in time and across an area. One of the features of the Upper Hunter is that it can rain in one section of the Upper Hunter and be totally dry in the other. Some sections got 10 inches of rain in a day. On a yearly average, that looked pretty good. It does not satisfy the extreme drought criteria. If there is a sudden downpour after a drought, the top soil on those properties where all the vegetation has been taken off&mdash;this occurred on many properties&mdash;is washed into the dams and knocks over fences. The next week, when it is all dried out again, the farmers are in a worse position. This happened in many areas of the Upper Hunter. According to the minister's criteria, that was fine; they had a higher annual rainfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has become a little more sophisticated. It has decided to build in something about the distribution of rainfall. It has taken six months of belting over the head for it to finally realise that it should also be looking at the distribution of rainfall. There are a number of things about that criteria that the federal government really needs to fix. One would hope that, in the almost inevitable cycles of drought we have in this country, when we get to the next big drought the government has its act together, has worked out the criteria and is able to apply it fairly and equitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the minister has had another think about the drought areas. He has moved through cabinet that a sum of money for extra drought assistance&mdash;more than $40 million&mdash;be distributed. The hope was that, after three strikes and out for the Upper Hunter, its farmers would all get in. Indeed, some farmers did. There were great celebrations in some parts of the Upper Hunter. But there was tragic disbelief in other parts because they were left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People there cannot understand why some areas were left out. The area west of Merriwa was left out. The area east of Singleton was left out. It has affected 200 farming families. We had a situation where the conditions were quite similar across the whole region. About 1,000 farmers got the drought assistance and 200 farmers did not. The result hinged on the division of a river or a road. Those on the wrong side of the road or the river missed out. Those on the other side were okay. But the rain did not stop at the river or the road. People cannot understand why they were left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to appreciate the tragedy of what this means to these people. Those without any income who live in a city are entitled to the unemployment benefit or a whole range of benefits. Some people in the Upper Hunter have had no income for over three years. What can they do? They are in a situation where they have no income. At the start of the drought, a lot of them had no debt. They just gradually went into more and more debt. Some are up to $0.25 million in debt. How on earth will they ever get out of that debt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to believe that this government could leave 200 farming families with no income support and with debt continually mounting. How will these people ever re-establish a viable business on the land again? The tragedy is that, in an area where there was good farming practice and land, the policies of this government have destroyed the livelihoods of these people. They will be moving off the land as great numbers of people move off the land over time. My family did that 30 years ago because of a similar set of circumstances. It goes on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have governments learnt from past droughts? Look at a chart showing the situation from the turn of the century. About every four to five years we move back into the drought cycle. When these people who have been so hardly done by from this government at this time get to the next drought, which will inevitably come after five or six years, they will not have got back on their feet again. They will still be in debt. They will not have been able to restock properly. When the next drought comes, they will get hit for six. It is a tragic cycle. The government calls itself a government of compassion and concern. It is just leaving the farming community in this country totally out to dry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction of farming people to this government's policies and actions has been quite dramatic. Let us see what some of them have had to say. The New South Wales Farmers Association, the Scone Rural Counselling Service and the Denman, Singleton and Merriwa rural lands protection boards are totally baffled by this discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 May the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> quoted a New South Wales Farmers Association official in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have deep concern that farmers in some areas who are suffering from drought just as much as the areas receiving assistance have been excluded. There are heaps of anomalies and questions. We are completely mystified.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that last bit for the government, and particularly for RASAC. There are heaps of anomalies and questions. This is after four goes at getting the guidelines right. They still have it wrong. Upper Hunter rural counsellor Andrew Badgery has told me that this split decision in the Upper Hunter is unbelievable. It is welcome news for those who are in but absolutely devastating for those people who have been left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Merriwa Rural Lands Protection Board secretary Kevin O'Malley has outlined the nonsense and bureaucratic humbug of this minister's decision. He said, `There's no difference between the areas of the Upper Hunter that are included and those that are excluded. Farmers in Singleton are now isolated and surrounded by adjoining properties which are in the exceptional circumstances area.' Farmers, as I said before, get it on one side of the road but not on the other. RASAC really has to have a look at its inconsistencies in its decisions and do something about it very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Carr government does not escape from this either. It stands condemned for accepting this sort of discrimination. Minister Amery has meekly gone along with the injustice. The state minister must steel himself to front Minister Collins and do something about this problem. They are both in the same party; surely he has some influence. Upper Hunter farmers demand this decision on Merriwa and Singleton districts be reviewed immediately. Labor's Mr Amery in New South Wales must go into bat for farmers in crisis. If he fails to pressure this minister immediately, he will be despised with the same passion as the federal minister. Senator Collins must end this arbitrary discrimination now. He must also guarantee exceptional circumstances payments for 12 months to give farmers some financial stability to re-establish their properties after one of the worst droughts this century. Minister Collins's action is yet another example of Labor's total disregard for farmers and rural and regional Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>The government's total response to this devastating drought has been extremely slow. Farmhand, which was initiated late last year by high profile media personalities, fired up the government about the extent of devastation caused by the drought in rural Australia. Mr Keating, the farmer's friend, as he described himself at the National Farmers Federation AGM late last year, said that he would not let the bush down. Federal government started to give some assistance, but it was reluctant to extend the exceptional circumstances to many desperate farm families. There has never been any recognition of the effect of the drought on small business. The basis for the tardiness in its response is that this federal Labor government is a very un-country government and a very un-country Prime Minister. He is very un-Australian in many of the ways that he approaches the problems that face this nation and this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the budget was brought down in terms of the fraudulent budget surplus, the Prime Minister told small business, `This is as good as it gets.' In the One Nation statement some years ago, he recognised how important a strong rural economy is. In one of the very few things that the Prime Minister has ever said with which I agree, he said that for a strong economy there must be a sustained recovery in the rural sector. We have seen the first signs that the drought is starting to break with the winter cereal crop that has been planted in the eastern seaboard, particularly in New South Wales, where about 3 1/2 million acres have been planted. This winter cereal crop is important for the wellbeing and the maintenance of the family farm in the eastern seaboard. However, Queensland and certain sections of New England have not had the falls that are required. It is vitally important for that crop to come in and take some pressure off those farm families that are really devastated after four long years of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason farmers were particularly affected by the drought was that the Labor government has run a very high inflation economy and very high interest rates. The terms of trade for farmers collapsed, and the wool crisis affected the whole of the farming community because wool spreads its tentacles right throughout the rural economy, whether you grow wool or not. Everything was deregulated, except the labour market and the waterfront. Then came the drought. It came when the prudent farmer's friend, the IEDs, had been removed. It gives some pleasure to note that the government realised the IED scheme was important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance needs to be given for farmers to prepare for economic downturn, but it took a long time for them to realize that. It also took a devastating drought, an effect on farm families and an effect on the budget which the government is now recognising will cost a large amount of money. In terms of social equity and the importance of our rural producers and exporters to the economy as a whole, it is money that is very well spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Last week's announcement of the new exceptional circumstances drought areas brought both pleasure and heartache to the Hunter Valley, which is an area that I know well. Farmers in the Scone Rural Lands Protection Board and half the Merriwa and Singleton boards were included. Unfortunately the other half, on the western side of the Merriwa Rural Lands Protection Board and Singleton farmers east of the Hunter River, awoke to the news that they would not be afforded help. How do you explain to a farmer who has had to shoot his sheep and see his cattle die that he is not worth helping in the eyes of the government while his next-door neighbour will receive a range of benefits however  belated that help may be? The government will not tell us why. It will not explain the anomalies of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins asks, `Where are the coalition's particular policies that would help these people who need help?' The obvious answer&mdash;it is so obvious, it hardly needs stating&mdash;is that we are not the government. But we do have one policy that would meet the problems that farmers have faced in this current crisis&mdash;that is, to give help where it is needed. We certainly would have done that. The information upon which Senator Collins based his submissions to cabinet must be made public. Most of all, they must involve an intense amount of scrutiny. He must release the RASAC report on which he based his decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to force those affected to wait months before assistance is obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, which is what is happening following the rejection of these areas for exceptional circumstances assistance in December. You might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when the exceptional circumstances provisions came out in December, at least one area&mdash;for reasons that are obvious, I will not name it&mdash;nowhere near met the expectations of exceptional circumstances of the Hunter Valley. In terms of the Farmhand assistance and other forms of charity provided generously to those affected by drought by mostly metropolitan areas of Australia, I understand that this particular area that had been included as having exceptional circumstances passed the hat around and gave this money to the Scone rural lands protection board, which, in addition to the $10,000 that was collected by fellow farmers in a nearby area, was able to hand out around $300,000 worth of charity. </PARA>

<PARA>The Auditor-General's report that is before the Senate is a very important report on a very complex subject. The Department of Defence is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the Commonwealth of Australia, spending roughly $7 billion a year. It involves very large individual contracts. Two contracts that are running at present are of the magnitude of around $5 billion each, which is a very large sum of money. Contracts extend over a large number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to outline some of the characteristics of Defence contracts. Firstly, they are in a field where there is often very little direct commercial competition because there are specialised defence weapons systems or platforms. Sometimes, but not always, they are on the fringes of technology&mdash;what is possible or pushing the boundaries out for something that is new to give the defence forces an advantage technically. They are nearly always written in military specifications. Military specifications grew up through this century because of the very arduous conditions to which military equipment has been subjected to in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military specifications produce a very high cost item because the quality is the highest you can get and it is often associated with very low volume production. There are many things now in relation to quality where civilian standards have exceeded military specifications. A classic example of that is in the electronics field. Computers that are specialised for defence analytical purposes, signal processing, et cetera, are a generation or two behind what is available in the commercial market with respect to their capability and speed. It is interesting that the United States is starting to recognise this. Within the last 12 months a number of US defence contracts have gone out which specifically mention that military specifications are not only not required but not to be applied to the product. One of those was the missile airborne warning system (MAWS) for which tenders were called recently, for infra-red weapons. Australia lags in the ability to get away from military specifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of defence contracting is a history of considerable cost over-runs and considerable time over-runs. That impacts very much on taxpayers because they have to pay cost increases that can be substantially more than they thought they would be committed for when the contract was let. There is also a great penalty economically if equipment is supposed to come in at a certain time and is late. Personnel are trained, provision is made for it and it does not arrive until 12 months, 24 months or 36 months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, one of the first things that governments around the world did was to use a cost-plus contract. That provided no incentive for manufacturers to perform efficiently. The movement 10 or 20 years ago was to have fixed price contracts. Fixed price contracts, when you are dealing with new technology, are hard to enforce. The services tend to change things and we get the situation, as we have got with the Anzac frigates, where everyone argues that it is a fixed price contract but, as the Auditor-General showed in his report presented earlier this week, there has been a 33 1/3 per cent increase on what is a very big contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day the only successful way of handling defence contracting is to reach a stage which we in Australia are quite a long way from&mdash;there must be a mutual partnership between government and industry. That must be based on mutual trust which, in turn, is based on complete honesty between the two parties, the government and the producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the tendering system is to provide open and effective competition between the tenderers and to obtain the best value for the Commonwealth of Australia. I think the taxpayers have been badly let down in that regard in two of the major contracts in this country in recent years&mdash;the Anzac ship program and the Collins program. The principal reason why they have been badly let down is that the contracts were rushed because the government of the day, the Labor Party, wanted to grant contracts and sign the tenders to the advantage of Labor State governments in South Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that is before us tonight illustrates some of the faults in the present system. There is no time, in the few minutes remaining to me tonight, to go through all of them. But I would like to touch on a couple of them because they illustrate the failings of the present system quite dramatically. The first is the light armoured vehicle contract, which is now called the Auslav&mdash;the provision of wheeled lightly armoured fighting vehicles for the army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all came about as an impromptu decision. The minister at the time, Mr Beazley, was in America, saw some of these vehicles and liked them. Having spent a long while on the defence estimates, I know what is going on there. Surprise, surprise&mdash;in this area of very tight budgetary circumstances, $20 million was found out of the blue to buy 15 vehicles because Mr Beazley liked them. They were imported to Australia and evaluated by the engineering development organisation in the Department of Defence. The department rushed immediately, at the bidding of Mr Beazley, into a purchase of these vehicles for the move to the north of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the haste there was no comparative study made of other wheeled vehicles around the world. This was the only one considered. It failed to pass the tests that the engineering development group did on it. We got rushed into buying something at a very high price. The first vehicle was handed over last week. It illustrates the failures in the passing of the very cumbersome procedures which the Department of Defence has in place in the Force Structure Policy and Programming Committee and the Defence Source Definition Committee. When these committees are put to the test, they are not worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point in the report that is of interest is the notorious submarine program which gave us Auditor-General's report No. 22 of 1991-92. As I said earlier, that was a politically driven decision. It is giving us the most expensive diesel electric submarines in the world, at about $1 billion a boat. The Auditor-General's report that we are discussing tonight points out that the contract was signed and then hundreds of amendments were entered into. That enabled the contractor under the terms of the contract to virtually write his own ticket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the business of the Steyr rifle. I note that there are people in the gallery tonight who have a great interest in rifles. We could have imported those rifles from Austria for $1,339. The actual price that the Auditor-General gives is $2,397 for Australian manufacture, an increase of 79 per cent in the purchase price. That is not supported in any way other than by the woolly notion that we wanted Australian production. The sad fact of life is that when that contract for 67,000 rifles is completed, ADI will close the line down and that facility will have no life thereafter. It will not be able to be reactivated readily, so the very high premium we paid there was paid for no benefit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report outlines 13 proposals for improvement in the contracting system. I want to touch briefly on four or five of them. The first one I want to talk about is the NAPNOC program&mdash;no acceptable price, no contract&mdash;which the United Kingdom operates. It means that if the government does not have a set price for the whole deal, it does not sign the contract. That will eliminate the hugely expensive nonsense that we got into with the Australian Submarine Corporation and the Collins class submarines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point made is that the UK and US governments insist that all contracts for defence allow the government to have access to the true costing and pricing data within the manufacturer. We do not have that in Australia. The third point that I want to emphasise is the need for training of officers involved in assessing contracts in Australia. The Auditor-General makes the point that there seems to be a great variation in the level of ability and knowledge of officers approving contracts and the officers themselves make the claim that they would like better training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point that the report makes which I think is of importance is that where we are going to produce things in Australia we should do it after careful analysis and look at the benefits that will come. Is it really necessary? Certainly, in the case of the Steyr rifle, a premium of 79 per cent for the production of a basic rifle which is readily available is not worth while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate tonight, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to a letter which the Australian Democrats recently received, and I assume other parties received as well, from the Queensland Farmers Federation. In part, the letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing regarding the Industries Commission Report into Research and Development. I understand the Report is now with the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to express its deep concern about the implications of the commission's draft recommendations, as these affect rural industry. The letter went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a very brief summary, the Commission in its draft report recommended that there be a dramatic reduction in public support for research and development in the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Farmers' Federation, along with many other rural organisations, made detailed arguments to the Industries Commission about why this would not produce an optimum outcome for the nation. At a time of balance of payments problems it is just not sensible to further reduce the competitive edge of a major export industry. The Queensland Farmers' Federation made the point that Australian agriculture is able to compete in highly corrupted world markets and this has only been achieved by maintaining a technological edge. To reduce support for research in rural industry would only put at risk our export advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we should underline very strongly those words. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission recognised there was a high return on investment in agricultural research and development. In making its recommendations, the Industries Commission seems to have assumed that there were a few spill over benefits from the public support of this research. This is clearly not the case. Also they assumed that rural industry would have the capability of increasing its research contribution to match the recommended reductions in public support. Queensland Farmers' Federation along with other industry groups demonstrated that constraints within industry would prevent this occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the debate today underlined what those constraints are. It is very clear, at least it should be, to senators in this place. The letter concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not aware of what impact our submission to the Industries Commission has made on its recommendations and final report. However I am writing to urge you as an elected member of parliament from Queensland to understand our deep concerns about the implications of a reduction in research and development funding. I am seeking your assistance in bringing these concerns to the attention of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe this is one occasion on which it is appropriate for senators from different states to underline together, not in any partisan way, the needs and concerns faced by the rural industry. To underline the Democrats' constantly repeated concern about the Industry Commission, I want to quote a few words from a recent address to the Queensland University of Technology by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every time I pick up a copy of an Industry Commission report, I wonder why $27 million worth of public money is being spent each year to allow these ideologues to parade their prejudices as good policy.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My colleague Senator Sid Spindler has spent a lot of time studying the effects of the Industry Commission on Australia's manufacturing industry. His Independent Parliamentary Inquiry in 1993 found that the policies of the Commission have cost Australia upwards of 200,000 jobs and significantly added to our current account problems.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . John Quiggan, from the ANU's Centre for Economic Policy, undertook a comprehensive survey of the industry Commission's approach to public sector reform and he found that the formal economic modelling upon which the Commission bases its work yielded "favourable simulations of policies that benefit the mining sector and the owners of capital at the expense of manufacturing and labour".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quiggan also found this formal analytical framework was supplemented by an informal framework within the Commission in which a commitment to a free market approach was paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He concluded there was an inevitable bias within the Commission in favour of privatisation and deregulation and that the Commission's approach effectively guaranteed support for "a pre-determined reform agenda regardless of the actual situation in any particular area."</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Industry Commission is not interested in genuinely exploring the problems within a particular industry or sector and coming up with fresh responses to those problems. What the Commission does is to impose its own economic and ideological template on whatever it is investigating and virtually works backwards to get the result it wants. As John Quiggan said, the result is virtually guaranteed, regardless of the realities of the situation under investigation. It is no wonder that the whole welfare sector is raising the same concerns as the Queensland Farmers Federation has brought to our attention tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak this evening on a matter which has been raised with me by community groups working with refugees in this country. At times, it seems that the government has a somewhat schizophrenic attitude to refugees. We see that time and again as it prides itself in the international community on its acceptance of relatively large numbers of refugees from various parts of the world, while at home it works very hard to deny entrance to those who may very well be refugees who choose to, or who are forced to, come unannounced. Those issues have been canvassed often in this place and will no doubt be aired again, and I do not want to dwell on them tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather, I want to talk about a very positive initiative which seeks to enable families of refugees to be reunited in Australia. I am sure most people would realise that, when a refugee or a family of refugees leave their own country and are resettled elsewhere, they often leave other family members behind. This is of great anxiety to them. Certainly, the government, to its credit, recognises that such separations occur and that they add an extra dimension of pain and anguish to people whose lives have already been uprooted as they flee persecution in their own lands. To overcome this, the government has for a long time provided particular identified migration categories to facilitate reunions of this kind. This is an aspect of the migration program which I heartily commend and I hope it will be regarded in a positive light by the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is less well known is that there are considerable costs involved for those who wish to use the reunion program. Naturally, the greatest cost is often that of funding the travel component&mdash;one of the enduring aspects of Australia's geographical isolation. Additionally, the government no longer provides travel funding for people coming to Australia under the special assistance category or the special humanitarian program in the migration program. People seeking to come to Australia under special assistance category or special humanitarian program category are either having to fund their own travel or having to rely on the ability of sponsoring groups in this country to extend financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years now there has been a travel loan fund, established by a range of church and community organisations, which provides low cost finance to families who wish to assist relatives coming out under the reunion schemes. The same funding should also, in my opinion, be able to be extended to these people. But, like so many other initiatives, demand has for some time outstripped supply. This is somewhat inevitable in light of the government's decision over the years to make more reunion visas available in the migration intake. We wish more community initiatives were victims of their own success in this way!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it has the consequence that, on average, the cost of bringing one family to Australia under this program is about $5,000, with some cases costing up to $10,000. To overcome immediate problems, the National Council of Churches of Australia recently committed an additional $50,000 to the fund. However, that will cover the costs of only some 10 reunions, assuming the average cost remains in the order of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The travel loan network has recently been formed to formalise and to coordinate the work which is going on in a number of agencies to assist with such costs. Obviously, the most important aspect of the network's work is to find the capital to establish a permanent, self-supporting investment fund. The fund works on the basis, as I said, of low cost loans to people who settled here as refugees. Those loans are replaced in a very responsible way. The need now is for an injection of a significant sum of money from the government to assist in this work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The travel loan network in a recent paper set out three possible courses of action to overcome the problems which it outlined: firstly, that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs fund the International Organisation for Migration, in itself an international network, to administer such a fund; secondly, that the department fund existing organisations involved in travel loan schemes; and, thirdly, that the department fund various NGOs to administer and follow up the new scheme, as outlined in the paper, with appropriate guidelines set by negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The travel loan network has called for a discussion involving the major players in the matter&mdash;namely, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration and the travel loan network itself. The paper presented recognises that the government provides considerable amounts of money for humanitarian purposes within the migration program and duly acknowledges the positive effect of the program itself and the work done by DIEA. However, it notes that even in the case of the special assistance given to Burmese people in the border regions with Thailand the airfares to Australia are not covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the network has come up with a range of fair, practical and effective possibilities to overcome this problem. It may be that the solution lies in one of the options I have mentioned, or it may be in a combination or variation of those options. There is clearly a considerable base of experience amongst groups involved in the network and I urge the government to draw on that expertise so that the positive effects of the humanitarian migration schemes will not be limited by peoples' financial difficulties in taking up the offer of resettlement which is given to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that earlier this week I raised in an urgency motion the matter of the government's abject failure in relation to its science policy. Honourable senators will also recall that this matter came to a head with respect to one part of Australia's scientific effort last year with the pressure on CSIRO and CSIRO scientists. That, of course, led to the Senate committee inquiry into CSIRO which made certain recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this week we had the urgency debate, which I was very pleased to see was supported by the opposition and which debate was won. I am sorry to say that the minister is not here by accident tonight to hear this letter I am about to read. He opened his contribution to that debate by saying that he was bemused&mdash;`bemused' was the word he used&mdash;by the fact that I had raised this debate. I take that word to mean that the minister simply did not understand what we were on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised with the content of this letter, which I received today&mdash;partly in response to letters which I have sent to scientists and partly in response to just the general ferment which is going on in science and the desperation with which scientists around this country are responding to the lack of a credible science policy in Australia. I received this letter today and I would like to read it into the record. It begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Coulter,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are right to be concerned about the long-term direction of CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>One could also say this for science generally in the universities and elsewhere; but this scientist was, until recently, a CSIRO scientist. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the public posturing of its spokesman from time to time, the prime focus of the organisation is commercial return to its customers, who are business entities (which does not include family farms), not the Australian public. Science comes a poor second, if it comes anywhere. It is thus a commercial servicing rather than a scientific research organisation. The composition and behaviour of its current board provides all the confirmation of this that the outside observer needs. It is an outrage that the Board should impose a gag on Chiefs of Division&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring there to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 22 May&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that the Chairman should seek to discredit concerned scientists within the organisation who have the temerity to question the changes proposed by the board . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He refers there to another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 26 May. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand from my former colleagues that the new director of the CSIRO Institute of Animal Production and Processing has stated to staff that "CSIRO is not a shelter for intellectually advantaged scientists" but that staff must listen to and serve their customers, that anyone who doesn't like it can leave and that, if they wish to criticise, they'd better resign first. This is an extraordinary insult to and attack upon people who have dedicated their working lives to an ideal within the organisation. In addition, I have been made aware that concerned scientists who made submissions to the Senate Enquiry last year have been targeted within the organisation for being disloyal. When I joined CSIRO in 1968, the Executive provided the resources and the scientists did scientific research under the direction of the Chiefs of the Divisions. Under these conditions, CSIRO became world famous for its science and the developments that flowed from it. Now, scientists must win the resources and account to management for those resources by achieving specified `milestones' in the time allocated for them by the customers. It may be possible to undertake technological developments under these conditions but they make scientific research impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps my own case will serve to illustrate CSIRO's new focus. I worked in the Division of Animal Production for 26 years. I reached the level of Chief Research Scientist in 1987 and am regarded throughout the world as a leading authority in the field of ruminant physiology and nutrition. With two colleagues, I won an AWRAP grant in 1993 but we were told that it was not enough. Like all industry grants, it paid operating expenses and technician salaries, but not investigator salaries and overheads, amounting to about 20-25% of the so-called full cost. I was told that, unless I obtained the rest of the money, or another grant in an area of higher priority, I would be made redundant.</PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what we heard from many scientists around the various CSIRO divisions during the Senate inquiry. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief told me that he "was thinking about (my) early departure", his justification being that "the Division would be better off financially for (my) departure". There was no possibility that the extra money could be found and my new grant proposals were unsuccessful. So, in January this year, I was retrenched at the age of 56 because, to quote the case for my redundancy, "The Division is unable to apply Dr Faichney's knowledge of digestive physiology to projects that are seen outside the Division as worthy of substantial funding with the result that Dr Faichney's area of work is now redundant to the Division."</PARA>
<PARA>This again is what I pointed to in the debate earlier in the week. Many of these senior, very experienced scientists who still have 10 years or so of useful working life in them are being lost to science in Australia. But to continue, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the Division's major current commercial development (Rumentek feed supplements) is based on the work that I did in the early 1970s carried no weight, nor did my early involvement in the work that led to the development of the AUSPIG software package, the Division's other main commercial development. I received a letter (from the Chief who made me redundant), written on the day of my retrenchment, which was ". . . to record CSIRO's appreciation of your outstanding commitment to science and the Australian livestock industries over more than a quarter of a century. You have added lustre to CSIRO's name overseas and within Australia have contributed significantly to the prosperity of the livestock industries." I am fortunate that, although my pension is 20% less than I would have received at age 65,, it is enough to live on. Thus my main concern now is to retrieve my emotional and intellectual self-esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that it is most important for you to maintain your inquiries into CSIRO and its management. Its very existence as a scientific research organisation is at stake.</PARA>
<PARA>And the letter is signed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">G.J. Faichney, BAgrSc, MScAgr, PhD, DAgrSc.</PARA>
<PARA>Need I say more about the plight of science in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of an aside, Senator Coulter and I could probably think of one famous world scientist that we met a few months ago in this building who may think that a 57-year-old scientist may have more than 10 years or so ahead of him. I refer, of course, to Dr Teller, who clearly at the age of 57 had many good years ahead and still does, I hope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I rise tonight to speak on the adjournment&mdash;I do not think I have done so for quite a long time now, probably a year or so&mdash;is that just a few minutes ago I had provided to me by someone in the press gallery a copy of a press release from the newly-created Indigenous Land Corporation, which was issued by David Ross, the newly-appointed chairman of that corporation. It has angered me somewhat. It is probably not a good time to make a speech when you are angry. I think I have cooled off a little bit and I will try to be as composed as I can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past few months this Senate has devoted an enormous amount of time to debating the formation of the Indigenous Land Corporation and the land fund and the intricacies of that. In this last sitting fortnight we have devoted quite a lot of time to the decision of ATSIC to provide $20 million out of $24 million to the Northern Territory to the exclusion, virtually, of every other part of Australia. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and, indeed, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, have all been censured by this Senate for their part in the legislative process that led to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media release that I refer to tonight reports a number of things. But the key decision of the first board meeting of the Indigenous Land Corporation reports that one of the three main decisions they made at that first board meeting was that until 1 July 1997 no funds would be allocated to the Northern Territory for land acquisition as a consequence of the ATSIC board decision to allocate $10 million of its land acquisition funding to the Northern Territory. Of course, you will already, Mr President, have picked up a discrepancy in the facts in the media release, because the reality is that $20 million, not $10 million, has gone to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is disturbing about the press release put out by Mr Ross on behalf of the corporation is its contradictory nature and the way that it sweeps aside the very interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders that this corporation, under the law of this land passed by this Senate and this parliament, is required to serve. Specifically, I will quote that Mr Ross waxes lyrical in his media release about his enthusiasm to `create a structure and process which reflect the needs of indigenous Australians'. He also goes on to stress:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Board's decisions would not be overly influenced by ATSIC or favour particular groups of indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fanciful to say such a thing on the first page of a document and on the second page to say that you have decided not to send any money into the Northern Territory because ATSIC had made a decision to send all of its money into the Northern Territory. It is absolutely farcical and, really, quite a sick joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes on to say that the corporation&mdash;and the board&mdash;should be judged on its decisions, and indeed it will be. I am recording in the Senate tonight my disbelief. In fact, when I went across to Senator Crowley, the minister on duty, to ask her permission to have this document incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I may seek leave to do that in a short while&mdash;Senator Crowley quite properly asked me what it was all about. As I sat there waiting for her to read it, I thought maybe it is a forgery. Maybe someone is just playing a joke on us here because this document is so outrageous, the decision of the ILC board is so outrageous, that indeed it could be a forgery. It could be someone playing a dirty joke on a few people in the gallery. I certainly hope no-one would be that sick, but I suspect that it is a genuine document and that makes it even sicker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just point to one of the very sad, sick, sorry and disgusting things about this press release that has so angered me. Mr Ross, or whoever wrote the press release, goes on to say that one of the decisions of the board, as required under law, is to develop strategies. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Key to the development of these strategies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about the national strategies and the regional strategies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be an assessment of current land acquisition and management needs.</PARA>
<PARA>For those of you who remember the debate, the board was required to develop a strategy as to how you would go about serving the needs of Aboriginal people in Australia and Torres Strait Islanders by assessing the various lands that are held at the moment, the needs of those people, and to make some sensible decisions about how you would go about that. The coalition, the Greens (WA) and, I think, most senators agreed that it would be a good idea to look at that on a regional basis and then to form a national strategy based on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board would, quite properly, as Mr Ross said in his press release, `want the strategy to reflect what people on the ground and communities want in the way of buying and managing land'. It does not take anyone too much intuition to figure out that if you hold a board meeting and announce straightaway that you are not going to give any money to the Northern Territory, that, firstly, that decision has been taken without reflecting what people on the ground and the communities want because, clearly, the board has not spoken to one community or one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in Australia before taking that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there can be no strategy because the board has not even figured out how to create its strategies. It has taken a decision that will affect the lives of an enormous number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It has done so without consulting the communities. During the debate, we heard a lot about consultation, and the lack thereof. When the committee I chaired went around Australia to talk to Aboriginal people about the land fund, most of them laughed when we told them that the minister had said this act was the result of the most extensive consultation in the history of Australia. It was a sick joke to them, as it was to us. There had been no consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I have had this table incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because it proves that the ALP member for Richmond (Mr Newell) has been caught out telling Richos on unemployment numbers in his very marginal electorate. Mr Newell is so embarrassed that I have exposed these Richos that he has complained to a number of my colleagues, presumably seeking their protection from being so exposed. I believe his actions are unprecedented and prove that my public debate with Neville Newell highlighting his duplicity is justified in the public interest.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, on your advice, Mr President. Specifically, what Mr Newell has done is quote misleading unemployment figures for his seat of Richmond in a rather pathetic attempt to try to create a positive impression of the record of the Keating government in that area. As an ALP backbench member for regional Australia, he has been placed in the position of defending the indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real record of this ALP government is appalling in regional areas such as the north coast of New South Wales, which is now living with very high and immovable structural unemployment. Neville Newell's record on unemployment, in his five years in this seat, has been appalling. What can he point to in terms of doing anything for unemployment in the area? What new projects has he attracted into the seat of Richmond to create the very needed employment? What he has done is try to put a favourable spin on Australian Bureau of Statistics numbers to hide the legion of jobless that the ALP has defined off the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know people who are still unemployed after completing training courses&mdash;older men and women on the mature age allowance, people with part-time work who want to work longer hours and those who have just given up looking for work. These are the real, hidden unemployed and they are not included on the official figures. What I am going to speak about tonight are the official figures; but, beyond that, there is a large group of people who are also unemployed on the north coast and, indeed, right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what Mr Newell claims as the unemployment figures. He claims unemployment has come down and is now only 12.5 per cent for March. Even on his own flawed reckoning, the level of unemployment is almost 50 per cent above the national figure for March. Mr Newell should be alarmed and ashamed when the real level of unemployment in his seat is revealed. With the ABS figures for that electorate, he has tried to defend this poor record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What people should realise about ABS figures is that they are samples. Some 80,000 people right across Australia are sampled. When that is broken down into 154 electorates, that is a very small sample. What happens is that we get a very inaccurate picture. I will go into the reason for that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSS figures are the real figures, because they measure real people who are seeking jobsearch or newstart allowance. These are the people who walk through the door and register. These are the real numbers and are the numbers I have had incorporated in the Senate record tonight. These figures are for the centres of Ballina, Brunswick Heads, Tweed Heads, Murwillumbah and Byron Bay. They show the accurate picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since March 1993, unemployment has risen steadily each month from 8,060 persons to 9,453 in March 1995. There have been no falls over this time. This is a 10 per cent increase, in the six months to March 1995, in the number receiving the dole cheque. This region is still looking for its five minutes of economic sunlight. What we have found happening across Australia is that there have been some boom spots, some hot spots in the economy, often associated with the centres of capital cities. But out in regional and rural Australia, people have been left behind. As a matter of fact, regional and rural Australia has not come out of the last recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Newell has tried to put a favourable spin on all this. The media have been awake to it. There has been great media interest in this story. The table I had incorporated was included in the local newspapers which showed quite starkly how Mr Newell had been misleading the local voters. As I said, he is using Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Ramsay, the journalist, has pointed out why this is dishonest, why you cannot do this. A column by him appeared on 13 May this year, headed `One Problem with the Jobless Fantastic News'&mdash;that is what the government has been portraying it as. It clinically sets out that the official ABS figures are at best a guess. Ramsay said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can two government agencies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the ABS and the DSS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the same day announce two quite different sets of figures on unemployment for the same month. The ABS is the agency the government relies on for official unemployment. The Bureau does not however actually count those people who want work but can't find it . . . it samples one half of one percent of the population each month . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Ramsay goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DSS does it differently. It actually counts each month all registered job seekers who get the range of unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Ramsay raises the obvious point that it is real people counted drawing unemployment cheques&mdash;not the ABS informed guess&mdash;that is the best guide. Ramsay concludes his piece, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the fact is that social security figures . . . the DSS figures indicate the more real level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I have had incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. That is what was in the local newspapers. It points out that what Neville Newell has been saying about unemployment in the Richmond area is totally misleading. He claimed the level was decreasing. The table shows it is increasing and, like many things in this government, that is just another l-i-e. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The composition and membership of an Australian delegation to any particular Meeting of the Conference of Parties is determined after considering the range of issues included in the agenda for that Meeting. It is established practice that the Australian delegations to each CITES Meeting comprise officers of the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as representatives of State and Territory nature conservation agencies and non-government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I approved the composition and membership of the Australian delegation to the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES following consultation with my colleague, Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian delegation to the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES acted in accordance with a delegation brief which I approved. The brief was compiled in consultation with representatives of relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory Government departments and agencies, non-government organisations and industry groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In accordance with Article XV of the Convention, a proposal to change the listing of the Australian population of saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) was lodged with the CITES Secretariat in June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) The proposal sought an unqualified listing of the Australian population of C. porosus on Appendix II to the Convention, in recognition of the improved conservation status of the species. Since 1985, the Australian population of C. porosus has been listed on Appendix II to the Convention, subject to criteria for ranching which were established by the Third Meeting of Conference Parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(b) The change to an unqualified listing of C. porosus on Appendix II to CITES will only allow the export of skins from saltwater crocodiles killed in the wild if the existing management programs are amended to permit this activity. Any changes to the current management arrangements for saltwater crocodiles in Australia will require approval by the Commonwealth under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, if exports are to take place. The Act provides for a public consultation process to be undertaken before a Commonwealth decision is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) The Republic of South Africa submitted a proposal to transfer the South African population of African elephant from Appendix I to Appendix II. The Australian position was to offer the proposal support, conditional on the concerns raised by the CITES panel of experts being met, and the new listing being annotated "for trade in non-ivory products only". As South Africa amended the proposal so that these two conditions were satisfied, Australia spoke in favour of the proposal. The proposal was not voted upon, as it was withdrawn by South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(b) The Republic of South Africa submitted a proposal to transfer the South African population of southern white rhinoceros from Appendix I to Appendix II. The Australian position was to oppose this proposal as submitted, but South Africa subsequently amended the proposal to read ". . . for the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable destinations and hunting trophies". Australia abstained from voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(c) Export quotas for leopard were granted to a number of African countries at the Seventh (1989) and Eighth (1992) Meetings of the Conference of Parties. The CITES Secretariat submitted a draft resolution for consideration by the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties which sought to improve the reporting requirements for the export of leopard hunting trophies and skins under the quota system. The proposal included a mechanism to suspend imports from any country granted an export quota that had not met its reporting requirements. Australia supported the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No proposals were submitted which related specifically to the cheetah, although Namibia submitted a draft resolution relating to trade in hunting trophies of species listed in Appendix I and another relating to application and interpretation of quotas for species included in Appendix I (the cheetah is listed in Appendix I, with annual export quotas approved for Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe). Australia opposed any wording in the former resolution which would restrict the capacity of an importing country to adopt stricter domestic measures as provided for in Article XIV of the Convention, and voted in favour of a proposed amendment to adopt wording consistent with the text of the Convention. Australia abstained from voting on the latter proposal as Australia was not able to implement the proposed resolution without legislative amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(d) Norway submitted a proposal to transfer the Northeast Atlantic and the North Atlantic central stocks of minke whale from Appendix I to Appendix II. Australia voted against the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(e) Several proposals seeking the inclusion of various species of tropical timbers in Appendix II were submitted for consideration by the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties. In addition, the United Kingdom submitted a draft resolution which aimed to address some of the technical and practical problems associated with applying the CITES framework to timber species. The Australian position was to pursue the initiative of the United Kingdom, preferring to defer consideration of listing additional timber taxa in the Appendices until the implementation problems which had already been identified had been addressed. Nevertheless, a voting position for Australia was formed on each timber proposal, based on the biological and trade criteria for listing species in the Appendices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the proposal by the United Kingdom, the Conference of Parties established a working group to investigate the implementation of CITES for timber species. A member of the Australian delegation was appointed to chair the working group. The group will liaise closely with other relevant international organisations such as the International Tropical Timbers Organisation, and is to report to the next Meeting of the Conference of Parties in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions of the Conference of Parties on individual proposals related to timber species are summarised in the Report of the Australian Delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In Australia, CITES is implemented through the provisions of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, which is administered by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency. The Act provides for the appointment of inspectors to enforce the Act. Any officer of the Australian Customs Service, any member of the Australian Federal Police; and any member of the police force of an External Territory is an inspector under the Act. In addition, a number of personnel who are employed by State conservation agencies have also been appointed as inspectors under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Criteria were established in 1976 at the First Meeting of the Conference of Parties to assist the Parties make decisions in relation to proposals to amend Appendices I and II to the Convention. The criteria establish standards of information required on the biological status and trade status of a species proposed for inclusion in Appendix I or Appendix II. Appendix I of the Convention includes all species threatened with extinction which are, or may be, affected by trade. Appendix II includes all species which, although not necessarily now threatened with extinction, may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival and other species, which must be subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of the aforementioned species may be brought under effective control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(a) The Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties made extensive changes to the Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and ll, to address various inadequacies in the original criteria which had become apparent since 1976. The new criteria are detailed in the Report of the Australian Delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(b) Australia adopted a negotiating position aimed principally at achieving an acceptable outcome that most Parties (including both developing and developed countries) were able to endorse. Australia supported the development of objective criteria for evaluating the suitability of taxa for inclusion in the Appendices to CITES, providing that such criteria represented a genuine advancement over the original criteria. Australia also supported the inclusion of precautionary measures in the new criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A member of the Australian delegation was appointed to chair a working group to resolve differences among Parties over the revised criteria. The product of the working group was a consensus document which was adopted by Committee 1 with 81 votes in favour to none against, and subsequently ratified in Plenary Session. Australia abstained from voting, indicating its desire to be seen to be impartial in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Apart from amendments to the Appendices, there have been no recent changes to the text of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Resolutions and decisions of Meetings of the Conference of Parties are made to guide Parties in the implementation of the Convention. They are not binding on Parties, but, as they represent a consensus view, it is usually in the best interests of Parties to abide by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the resolutions and decisions made by the Meetings of the Conference of Parties may, simplistically, be interpreted as having enabled expanded trade in some specimens of species which are classified as being endangered, in cases where such trade will not be to the detriment of the wild population, such as animals that have been legitimately bred in captivity and plants which have been artificially propagated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Report of the Australian Delegation includes copies of all resolutions and decisions of that Meeting. In relation to each of these resolutions and decisions, Australia adopted a negotiating position which favoured an increase in the effectiveness of the Convention, so that species are given a level of protection commensurate with their conservation status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The development of commercial markets for wildlife products may assist in the preservation of the harvested species and other wildlife by providing a landholder with an alterative or supplementary means of productive land-use. It may act as an incentive for the landholder to maintain areas of natural habitat on the property which may, in the </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">absence of such an incentive, be alienated for agriculture or other forms of land use inimical to all but the most hardy species of wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For such use to contribute to the long-term survival of the harvested species, the harvest must be conducted in accordance with the principles of ecological sustainability ie. at a level which may be sustained by the wild population without adversely affecting the species' role in the ecosystem, or the ecosystem itself. A sound, scientifically-based monitoring mechanism should be in place to detect any adverse ecological impacts of such harvesting, and the management regime needs to be sufficiently robust to respond to any adverse ecological impacts that are detected. The harvesting should comply with national and international legal obligations and policies, and also provide for the protection of wildlife from avoidable cruelty and suffering, where the harvested wildlife is an animal.</PARA>
