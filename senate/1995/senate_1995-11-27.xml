<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments in the light of a recent court decision that has jeopardised the viability of the voluntary administration scheme under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, which commenced operation in June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law provides a regime for companies to enter voluntary administration as an alternative to liquidation. It is an extremely popular method of dealing with companies in financial difficulty. The scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into a deed of company arrangement with its creditors. This enables the company to continue trading for a period with a view to producing some return for creditors, rather than being wound up immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advantage of taking this course from a creditor's perspective is that if the company is allowed to continue operating its business, there is a likelihood that a better return to creditors will be obtained than if the company is liquidated immediately. The mechanism also serves to avoid the costs and delays often associated with liquidations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics published by the Australian Securities Commission and industry bodies show that the voluntary administration scheme is an increasingly popular means of dealing with corporate financial difficulties. In a significant proportion of cases, companies enter into deeds of company arrangement with their creditors, rather than proceeding directly to winding up, in an effort to save the company, or at least its business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases, after a period of trading under a deed of company arrangement, it will become apparent that the continued trading of the company will not be successful. In that case, the creditors are permitted to have the company liquidated immediately. The Corporations Law provides for an automatic transition to a creditors' voluntary winding up in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June this year, His Honour Mr Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme Court held in Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 874; (1995) 17 ACSR 295 that where persons deal with a company under a deed of company arrangement and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in the winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. His Honour remarked that this is not a result that could have been intended by the legislature and therefore called for urgent legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the wake of the Crawford House decision, there have been calls for urgent legislative amendment, particularly from practitioners in the insolvency area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this matter is of such importance to ongoing and future voluntary administrations, the Government has moved swiftly to introduce a Bill which contains amendments to overcome the apparent anomaly in the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Content of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains only two substantive amendments to the Corporations Law. The first is designed to ensure that debts and claims arising while a company is under a deed of company arrangement are admissible to proof in a subsequent winding up. The second is intended to protect the validity of acts of liquidators who admitted such debts and claims on the basis that they were provable, prior to commencement of the amendments in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government or business as the proposed amendments clarify the operation of existing provisions of the Corporations Law and will not result in additional costs. The Explanatory Memorandum describes the potential impact on creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I confirm that, in accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council on Corporations has been consulted and has given approval for the introduction of the Bill into the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973  has been to implement budget decisions relating to student assistance. The measures will focus the financial help provided by the taxpayer more sharply on those students most in need and improve services to clients and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Austudy and permanent residents who choose not to become Australian citizens</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Austudy program is to assist financially disadvantaged students who are Australian citizens or permanent residents to complete secondary education and gain an initial tertiary qualification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While substantial, the funds available for Austudy are limited and priorities for their expenditure must be set within overall budgetary constraints. The bill will amend the act so that, from 1 January 1996, Austudy will be targeted to students who have a long term commitment to contributing to the Australian community and who show their commitment by becoming Australian citizens. The decision to take out Australian citizenship will remain a matter of individual choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the usual case, a student who is a permanent resident of australia will be able to receive Austudy until he or she meets the residency requirements for Australian citizenship (which is normally two years after the person is granted permanent resident status) and for one additional year. To be eligible to continue receiving Austudy after that year, the person must, before the end of that year, apply for Australian citizenship and have that application approved by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Students whose applications are approved within the required timeframe, if otherwise eligible, will continue to receive Austudy while they are waiting to attend a citizenship conferral ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As people may not apply for citizenship in their own right until they are 16 years old, students who have met the residency requirement before they turn 16 will have one year from their 16th birthday to become, or obtain approval to become, an Australian citizen during which time they may be eligible for Austudy. The basic student payment for 16 and 17 olds will be available to permanent residents</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consolidation of income support for secondary students aged 16 and 17</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To continue the process of streamlining government assistance to families, all payments to 16 and 17 year-old secondary students will be administered through the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic family payment currently paid for 16 and 17 year old secondary students by the Department of Social Security will be replaced by a payment known as the basic student payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will remove the inconvenience of families having to deal with both the Department of Social Security for family payment and DEET for Austudy to establish eligibility for benefits for older student children. It also reflects the government's intention that assistance to young people in this age group is conditional on their participation in education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic student payment will be means tested on the student's income and the income of his or her parent or parents. There will also be a family assets test. The income and assets tests thresholds will be similar to those currently applying to the basic family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic student payment will be a maximum of $500 a year. It will be paid in two instalments of $250 (maximum). In most cases these payments will be made in January and July of the year of study to the student's nominated parent or approved care organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arrangements will be put in place for students who, on 30 June 1996, are 16 or 17 and eligible for the basic family payment to transfer to the basic student payment on 1 July 1996. Students who turn 16 on or after 1 July 1996 and who have been eligible for the basic family payment immediately before they turn 16, will transfer to the basic student payment on their 16th birthday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes a number of consequential amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to abolish family payment for children 16 years and over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to the Austudy/Abstudy supplement scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Austudy/Abstudy supplement scheme is a loan scheme under which tertiary students can forgo part or all of their Austudy or Abstudy benefits up to a maximum of $3,500 a year for an interest-free loan of twice the amount of benefits forgone, that is, up to $7,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students who have already received Austudy or Abstudy at the time of application may maximise the amount of supplement they are able to receive by forgoing some, or all, of those benefits previously paid. However, under the existing arrangements this must be done by specified cut off dates of 31 May (for benefits received during the period from 1 January to 31 May) or 30 September (for benefits received during the period from 1 July to 30 September).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes to abolish these cut off dates so that students can trade Austudy or Abstudy benefits at any time before the end of their eligibility period. The student therefore will be able to take the maximum amount of supplement to which he/she is entitled at a time of their own choosing. This will mean that a student who applies late in the eligibility period will be able to obtain a greater amount of supplement than under the existing arrangements. The amendments will take effect from 1 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supplement loans are also available to a second category of students. Dependent tertiary students who meet all the criteria for Austudy or Abstudy apart from the parental income test are able to obtain a loan of up to $2,000 a year if their parents' "adjusted income" is under $50,850.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a small number of students have chosen to take up this option. The government has decided, therefore, that, from 1 January 1996, loans for students from families with parental income above the Austudy or Abstudy limits will no longer be available. This is consistent with the government's commitment to target assistance to those in greatest need. The bill includes amendments to give effect to this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students from low income families who are eligible for Austudy or Abstudy will not be affected by this change. These students will continue to have access to supplement loans of up to $7,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Penalty for failure to notify a change in circumstances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President,  currently a person who is in receipt of benefits under the act is obliged to tell the department, within seven days of their occurrence certain events that may affect the level of benefit being paid. In some circumstances, a failure to do so could lead to a person being imprisoned for up to twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided to increase the amount of time a person has to tell the department of such events from seven to fourteen days. It has also decided to remove the criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it still remains important that the department becomes aware of changes in the circumstances of a person receiving a benefit, because it could mean that a person is receiving more benefit than the legal entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, in place of the criminal sanction, the bill inserts a provision that makes a person liable for a penalty of ten dollars for each week, or part of a week , up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. Where the person fails to inform the department within 14 days of an event which affects eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to notify changes in circumstances is now the most significant factor contributing to the size of student assistance debt. It is hoped that this change will encourage the earlier reporting of changes and will ultimately reduce the level of student indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Minor and consequential amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes an amendment to omit reference to the Austudy and Abstudy Dependent Spouse Allowance (DSA) which is necessary because of the government's decision to abolish this allowance. From 1 January 1996, clients in respect of whom the DSA would have been payable will be able to apply for the parenting allowance provided by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also proposes a number of other minor amendments to the act. These are explained in this bill's explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, these measures build on progressive improvements to Austudy client services in recent years to reinforce the government's commitment to assist students in greatest need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY (SUPERVISION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, superannuation is the central pillar of the government's strategy to boost retirement incomes and raise national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of government reforms, most working Australians are now covered by superannuation. Regular contributions being made today will generate higher retirement incomes in the future. And, the growth of superannuation savings is encouraged by generous tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to promote superannuation brings important responsibilities for the financial sector. Financial institutions and advisers must explain the benefits of long term investment in a diversified portfolio. To encourage the industry to take a longer term view on investments, the government now requires that funds report their average return for the past five years, as well as individual figures for each of those years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, fund managers must justify the government's decision to have superannuation managed in the private sector by investing responsibly and delivering strong fund performance over time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's commitment to improving superannuation coverage and the adequacy of end benefits is matched by an equally strong commitment to enhancing the security of member entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sound regulatory framework of `checks and balances' is essential for maintaining public confidence in superannuation and ensuring the long term success of the government's retirement incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's prudential framework is embodied in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (or SIS) legislation. Integral components of the SIS regime ensure that fund members have access to both their fund's internal complaints handling arrangements and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purposes of this bill are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to expand and strengthen the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that fund auditors certify that funds comply with certain provisions of the SIS Act and Regulations;  and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to transfer various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner into the body of the SIS Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to expand on each of these elements of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation Complaints Tribunal</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government set up the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal last year to provide fund members with low cost, informal and speedy dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tribunal has made good progress in its first year. In the 12 months ending June 1995, the tribunal received a total of 416 written complaints that were within its jurisdiction. Around a quarter of these were resolved, with the balance still in the statutory-based inquiry and conciliation phases as at the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the tribunal has been subject to some criticism relating to the statutory limits on its jurisdiction. These limits have caused a large number of complaints to be excluded by the tribunal on the grounds that they could not be handled under existing legislative constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Included amongst these were complaints about disability benefits involving the assessment of medical evidence and certain complaints about life office superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill aims to improve the effectiveness of the tribunal by clarifying and strengthening its jurisdiction over these kinds of complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complaints about disability claims are set to be handled by the tribunal from 1 November 1995 when the regulation excluding the consideration of `medical evidence' expires. This bill will enhance the effectiveness of the tribunal handling medical evidence complaints in two important ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it will protect the members of funds that arrange disability cover through an external insurer, by enabling the tribunal to make orders directly against that insurer. This means funds will not face the unfunded liabilities which could otherwise arise where a fund is ordered to pay a disability benefit that has been rejected by its external insurer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill puts in place various time limits to prevent the tribunal being swamped with intractable `old' disability complaints where the trail of medical evidence has gone cold. That is, where the illness or injury which led to a claim may have been obscured by subsequent complications or a new condition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, the tribunal will not be able to consider complaints about disability claims decided by fund trustees before 1 November 1994. Given that I announced the tribunal would deal with `medical evidence' complaints in October 1994, the amendments are essentially prospective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further enhance the tribunal's efficiency in this area, the government will also support the development of `best practice' guidelines for disability claims handling by the superannuation industry. The peak industry associations are consulting closely with the tribunal and Insurance &amp; Superannuation Commission to develop these guidelines, which will be published by way of a Circular. Although compliance with these guidelines will be voluntary, it is expected that they will promote better decision-making by funds and insurers thereby minimising the volume of `medical evidence' complaints to the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to life office superannuation, it was always the government's intention that the tribunal should have coverage over all superannuation products, including those offered by life offices. Unfortunately, the legislation did not give full or certain effect to this intention and the tribunal has been unable to effectively deal with a common source of complaint, namely, allegations about life office agent misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill rectifies this problem by enabling the tribunal to deal with complaints about superannuation-related annuity products and life office agent misrepresentation. Where the sale of a life office superannuation policy was unfair or unreasonable, the bill enables the tribunal to order the cancellation, variation or repayment of the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to cover life office superannuation are fully prospective, in that the tribunal's new jurisdiction will apply only to life products purchased after Royal Assent. People with complaints about life products purchased before that date can pursue their concerns through the life industry complaints scheme, as at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that life offices have a strong presence in the highly competitive retail superannuation market and that allegations of life agent misrepresentation have been a source of particular concern. However, they are not the only public offer superannuation providers, and it is important that all market players are treated equally before the tribunal, to the extent that this is appropriate and practicable. To this end, further amendments will be made at the earliest opportunity in 1996 to ensure that, as far as possible, the new remedies for sale misconduct are extended to all public offer superannuation providers and intermediaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expanding the tribunal's jurisdiction through the amendments in this bill will add considerably to the tribunal's operational workload. In anticipation of this, the bill provides for the creation of a new full-time Deputy Chairperson position and two additional part-time members. Together with the recent upgrading of the tribunal's secretariat, these measures demonstrate the government's strong commitment to ensuring that the tribunal is able to fulfil its charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has carefully examined the High Court decision of Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission &amp; others, handed down in February this year, and is satisfied that the existing legislation and the proposed amendments will not involve the tribunal exercising judicial power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compliance audits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second main element of the bill is amendments to enhance the prudential supervision of the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the SIS Act to require that fund trustees arrange for a qualified auditor to carry out yearly `compliance audits'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fund's auditor will be required to certify that the fund complies with certain requirements of the SIS Act and Regulations. The trustee is then required to pass on that report to the Insurance &amp; Superannuation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This external check builds on existing audit requirements in the SIS regime. Auditors are already required to sign off on a fund's financial statements. They are also subject to whistleblower provisions which force auditors to report  suspected breaches of the law to the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tougher audit rules are supplemented by the ISC's own program of audits to check that funds comply with prudential rules and are run in the best interests of fund members. The ISC conducted nearly 800 fund audits around Australia in 1994/95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together, these measures will help protect the interests of fund members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transfer of modification orders</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill transfers into the SIS Act various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner under Part 29 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these modification orders that are being transferred are temporary orders expiring on 30 June 1996. Accordingly, unless they are transferred into the body of the SIS Act they will cease to have effect on that date causing substantial disruption to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The modification orders are generally made to deal with transitional or technical problems in the legislation which are having unintended effects on industry. They provide an avenue for the Commissioner to appropriately respond to such problems in the interim period before Parliamentary amendments to the legislation can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The modification orders being transferred relate to a number of varied matters and their inclusion in the body of the SIS Act will improve the clarity and effectiveness of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of these modification orders into the SIS Act reflects the government's belief that modification orders made by the Commissioner should be incorporated into the body of the act at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to financial implications, the bill provides for the creation of a deputy chairperson and two part time members of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to deal with the increased workload the tribunal will have. In a full year, the cost of these positions is estimated to be about $270,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a further resource bid will be brought forward for consultation as required with the Department of Finance, in the additional estimates process. The full ongoing year cost of the bid is expected to be of the order of $500,000. Further `one-off' costs, including a new case management system, would be a further $210,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, superannuation has a vital role to play in Australia's economic future. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that there is a strong and effective supervisory framework for superannuation. The amendments will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ISC and Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and consequently protect member entitlements and maintain public confidence in the superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CARER PENSION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995 was introduced. That bill provided for the implementation of initiatives announced in the 1995 budget that responded not only to the particular needs that families with children have at certain times, but also to making the system simpler and more consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises, however, that it is essential for the Australian social security system to be responsive to the needs of all groups in the Australian community. To that end, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 serves to give legislative effect to a wide range of 1995 budget initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One group of 1995 budget initiatives will mean a better deal for people caring for others in the community, as well as for those receiving care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the bill will ensure that a person who cares for another person may qualify for a carer pension even if the caree is not in receipt of a social security or veterans' affairs pension or a social security benefit. A person whose family income and assets are less than $61,020 and $559,250, respectively, will be able to have someone on carer pension look after them. These limits will rise in line with the family payment income and assets tests. Carers will, of course, have to meet all other existing qualification criteria for carer pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, from July 1996 it will no longer be a qualification requirement for carer pension that the carer live in the same or an adjacent house to the person receiving care. As long as they provide the necessary level of care, it will not matter where the carer lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, from March 1996, carers will also continue to get carer pension for a further 14 weeks following the admission of a care recipient to a nursing home, unlike current arrangements where qualification ceases as soon as the person being cared for permanently enters a nursing home. This period of payment will give carers time to adjust and look for work or meet the requirements of other income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also ensures that the same beneficial arrangements for people in nursing homes will be available for people being cared for in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From March 1996, if a person receiving care moves into the home of their carer, the care recipient's former home will be disregarded under the assets test for two years. Similarly, a carer's former home will not count as an asset for two years if they move into the home of the person for whom they are caring. In addition, from March 1996, rent assistance will be immediately available to a social security recipient who must leave their home to be cared for by somebody in the community, or to care for someone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further group of initiatives contained in this bill relates to rent assistance. Rent assistance is a supplement for people who are in the private rental market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, from March 1996, the maximum rates of rent assistance will increase by $5 per fortnight for families with children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, rent thresholds will increase by $5 per fortnight to coincide with the March 1996 CPI increase. This will allow better targeting of assistance to rent assistance recipients who pay relatively higher rents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are currently a number of rent assistance recipients who are `saved' at beneficial rates of rent assistance equal to the amount they received prior to rent assistance reforms in 1989 and 1993. This results in their receiving a higher rate of income support than similar recipients assessed under the current provisions. The bill provides that, from March 1996, any CPI increases in the total social security entitlements of these `saved' recipients will reduce their `saved' rate of rent assistance until the `saved' rate equates with the normal current rate of rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for the payment, from January 1997, of a new residential care allowance. This new indexed allowance will replace rent assistance for residents of nursing homes and hostels. Residential care allowance will be paid at the same rate, and be subject to the same threshold, indexation and all other arrangements, as currently apply to rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social security pensioners with little or no other income apart from their pension, are often unable to access lump sum amounts to help meet living or capital expenses such as emergency replacement of household equipment and car repairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will help recipients of some social security pensions and benefits by allowing a lump sum advance of a person's payment. The maximum advance available will be the lesser of $500 or 6 per cent of one year's pension payments and will be repayable by deductions from ongoing fortnightly pension payments over 13 fortnights. Advances will be made only to persons with the ability to manage financially on a reduced payment for the duration of the repayment period. A person will be able to increase the amount of deductions for early repayment or apply to have deductions reduced in times of hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the measures contained in the Social Security Legislation (Family Measures) Amendment Bill 1995 and the special rent assistance measure for families described earlier, sole parents receiving guardian allowance will be paid an extra $4 per fortnight from September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families will also benefit from other measures announced in the 1995 budget. These measures provide for the simplification of the application and assessment process for family payment and child care assistance, including combining the child care assistance and family payment annual review processes and better aligning the definitions for child care assistance and family payment. Ongoing entitlement to child care assistance and family payment will be able to be reassessed at the same time. There will be increased emphasis on child care assistance compliance, through the introduction of family compliance reviews, including data-matching and risk based interviews. The bill will authorise data-matching activity, from 1 January 1996, in relation to the information provided to the Department of Social Security for determining whether child care assistance should be paid to a person, to ensure that the information is accurate and consistent with information provided by the person to other Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Data-matching Program is conducted under the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. The Data-matching act was originally given two years of operation, with a sunset clause to take effect in January 1993. Although the government later attempted on two occasions to have the sunset clause repealed, the Parliament decided to extend its operation for a finite term. Unless amended, the Data-matching Act will operate until January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After four years of operation, the government considers that the Data-matching Program has achieved, and will continue to achieve, substantial savings in public expenditure. It is an important control on personal financial assistance schemes, helping to keep them free of abuse and fraud. Accordingly, one of the amendments proposed by this bill to the Data-matching Act provides for the repeal of the sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment in this bill relates to departure certificates. Specifically, a departure certificate is required for all social security pensioners who leave Australia and, currently, pensioners who remain absent from Australia for more than six months without a departure certificate have their pensions cancelled automatically. Pension may only be re-granted when the pensioner returns to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The harshness of the departure certificate provisions has created concern and some complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New arrangements to be implemented by this bill will mean that pensioners who leave Australia without obtaining a departure certificate will have their pensions suspended, rather than cancelled, after they have been absent for a period of six months. Pension will not be cancelled until the pensioner has been absent from Australia for twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review form will be sent to their last known address and pension will be restored, with full arrears, if the review form is returned within three months of its issue and the person still qualifies for pension. In cases where the review form is returned more than three months after its issue, but before the anniversary of the pensioner's date of departure from Australia, pension will be restored from the date of return of the form only, with no arrears being payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary to the Department of Social Security will have the discretion to restore pension, with full arrears, up to two years from the pensioner's date of departure from Australia, in circumstances when being able to comply with procedures, was beyond the pensioner's control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With a view to providing for more certainty in decision making and alleviating concerns about recovery for a small number of debtors whose circumstances warrant leniency, this bill proposes amendments to the waiver provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarify that part of a debt may be waived in appropriate circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide for general recovery of debts over $50 where recovery can be effected by withholdings from social security payments;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide for decisions on recovery of debts to be put on the same basis as commercial decisions about present values;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide for negotiated settlements in the administrative appeals process in addition to through civil action;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide for non-recovery of debts where there are special circumstances (within certain limitations) that would make recovery inequitable; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide for waiver where a person has a notional entitlement to parenting allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of non-budget portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A payment received by a trainee in part-time training in a Labour Force Program currently is not taken into account as income for the purposes of the Social Security Act, if the trainee is also receiving a social security or service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in this bill expand this exemption from the definition of income to include a payment made to a trainee in part-time training or work experience under a Labour Market Program where the trainee is receiving a social security benefit or youth training allowance and the payment is made to cover expenses associated with participation in the training or work experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the waiting period provisions relevant to job search allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance to allow any part of a particular waiting period already served by a person to be transferable across payment types.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of further amendments to sickness allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The qualification conditions for sickness allowance for certain 15 year olds will be modified in two ways. First, clients who are independent of their parents' or other adult financial support will qualify for sickness allowance without having to meet the work history or 13 week CES registration elements of qualification. Secondly, clients who live at home with a parent who is receiving a social security pension or benefit, a service pension or certain education payments will be able to access sickness allowance if they can establish a work history or job offer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qualification for sickness allowance is generally limited to two years. The two year preclusion period does not apply if incapacity for work is caused by a different or more serious medical condition or by relapse of a chronic condition or by the fact that the person is undergoing a program of counselling, treatment or therapy for drug or alcohol abuse. The bill amends the Social Security Act so that, in addition to the above exception, the two year preclusion period does not apply if a person's incapacity for work is caused by a medical condition and the person is awaiting surgery that is expected to improve the person's condition within two years from the date on which the person was re-granted sickness allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also removes the requirement for a medical practitioner to indicate whether a social security recipient's condition is likely to improve if that person receives treatment or undertakes a rehabilitation program, as it is considered that the requirement is not essential to determining qualification for, or payability of, sickness allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, in relation to sickness allowance, amendments are made to allow the liquid assets test waiting period to be waived in hardship cases. This will align sickness allowance with waiver provisions that already exist in relation to job search allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends sole parent and sole parent special needs provisions in the Social Security Act to clarify those situations where a person is obliged to pursue maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, the bill includes two categories of amendments relating to bereavement allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the bereavement provisions for carer pension to provide that bereavement payments will be paid to a person who ordinarily receives carer pension when the person who they care for, dies during respite care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions that deal with special short term bereavement payments for family payment, child disability allowance and double orphan pension are amended to ensure that the four week bereavement period commences on the day after the child's death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act provides protection of ongoing social security pensions and benefits from garnishee action. This same protection is to be extended to a number of one-off or lump sum social security payments that have been introduced in the last few years, such as the employment entry payment and advance payments of job search allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill clarifies the conditions under which a person's social security pension, benefit or allowance will cease to be payable due to the person's failure to nominate a bank account into which the person's social security payments are to be made. A person may be paid a social security payment up to 28 days from the day the person becomes entitled to the payment. The person then has three months from the date the payment ceases to be payable to nominate an account. If the person nominates an account within three months then arrears are payable. If the person nominates after three months, arrears may only be paid from the date on which the nomination was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments made by this bill meet an undertaking previously given by the government during the second reading debate on the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994, that amendments would be made to the Social Security Act to draw attention to the ability to `convert' an imprisonment term to a monetary penalty via the operation of the penalty units scheme in the Crimes Act 1914. Similar amendments are also made to the Farm Household Support Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes some minor amendments relating to compensation recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, it clarifies the situation that when a person's entitlement to periodic compensation payments under a law of a State or Territory is converted into an entitlement to a lump sum and it is calculated by reference to a period, the person is considered to have received in each fortnight during the period, a periodic compensation payment equal to the lump sum divided by the number of fortnights in the period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill addresses too the situation of a person receiving a compensation affected payment under the Social Security Act who receives a lump sum compensation payment and whose partner is qualified for a compensation affected payment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. In that case, the smaller of the compensation part of the lump sum or the amount obtained by adding the compensation affected payments made under the Social Security Act and the pension payments made under the Veterans Entitlements act is recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of minor or technical amendments that, for example, remove superfluous terms from the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. I will briefly outline the changes of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 is operative from the seventeenth of March 1995 and contains an amendment to item 31 in part II of schedule 4 to the principal act. This concessional item allows the duty free importation of aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft with the exception of goods used in the servicing of aircraft. Following the government's acceptance in 1991 of recommendations contained in Industry Commission report No. 9 on the commercial tariff concession and by-law systems, the terms of item 31 in schedule 4 were revised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By a broad application of the current conditions, it has been possible to import, duty free, most goods used in aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has now decided to restrict the coverage of this item by excluding textiles and goods made of textiles for use on aircraft. This initiative will remove the competitive advantage previously accorded imported goods over locally sourced goods by the use of item 31. It will also encourage the use of Australian raw textile materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2 of the bill is operative from the first of April 1995. Customs tariff rates of duty have been subjected to a phasing regime since July 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components have traditionally been classified by the Australian Customs Service as infusion and transfusion sets for blood and other fluids. They were subject to ten percent duty prior to the first of July 1995, phasing to five percent in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This classification was successfully challenged in the administrative appeals tribunal with the result that the AAT set aside the customs classification, considering the goods to be properly classified to a duty free item. The immediate removal of the ten percent assistance would have had a detrimental effect on local industry and is not consistent with the intent of the government's tariff phase down programme. This government is aware of the consequences to industry of sudden and large reductions in the level of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment reinstates the intended level of assistance for the subject goods by specifically designating blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components in the tariff classification that customs originally considered appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 3, which is operative from the tenth of May 1995, implements the 1995/1996 federal budget announcement of an increase of ten percent in the customs rate of duty for manufactured tobacco and tobacco products. The previously legislated increase of five percent for these goods planned for August 1995 will now not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 is operative from the first of July 1995 and contains a number of amendments. The first inserts an additional note in chapter 27 to define "fuel oil". In recent years oil refineries have been producing fuel oils of lower density which are capable of being used in diesel engines. The effect of this note will be to exclude light fuel oils from the new definition of fuel oil and in future those light fuel oils will attract the diesel fuel rate of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the rates of customs duty on aviation gasoline are increased by 0.883 cents per litre on aviation kerosene and by 1.847 cents per litre on aviation gasoline. These increases were announced by the treasurer in the 1995/1996 federal budget. The additional revenue will provide funding for aviation safety regulation and be part of the industry's contribution to the recovery of airway services costs attributable to aviation gasoline powered aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change inserts in chapter 73 an additional note to confirm the tariff classification of razor wire. The new additional note implements a decision of the world customs organization that this wire be classified in tariff heading seventy three thirteen. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4a is operative on and from the eleventh of October 1995 and contains amendments to the duty arrangements on topped crude petroleum oils. These amendments complement the changes made to fuel oil in schedule 4. Since that amendment, the production of light fuel oil has dropped dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has now come to the notice of the Australian Customs Service that production of topped crude petroleum oil has increased significantly since the first of July this year. Further, topped crude oil is being used as a substitute for diesel fuel. Again there exists the potential for a multi-million dollar loss in government revenue</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes contained in this schedule have the same effect as those implemented for fuel oil. That is, the physical characteristics of fuel oil produced from topped crude petroleum oils are defined in additional note one to chapter twenty seven and a tariff split created for this category of fuel oil. Goods not meeting those specifications have a separate subheading and will attract the higher diesel fuel rate of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes contained in this bill are of an administrative or technical nature and have no duty implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those of us who were here last week will remember that I had about one minute to commence the second reading debate on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995. I made the point then that much of the detail associated with this bill will be dealt with by regulation and the Senate will be forced to play a guessing game in an effort to determine what the real intention of a lot of these critical clauses is. But I have no doubts that during the debate on this bill in the committee stages some of the concerns that have been raised in the other place and here will be clarified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank has created a lot of division amongst the Labor Party in particular, because the Commonwealth Bank was held up as one of the icons of the Labor Party. The government have taken this very opportunistic step to sell off the rest of the Commonwealth Bank to fill a hole in their budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was ever any doubt about the disastrous state of our economic position, this bill says it all. The Australia of today has one of the largest deficits in the world. Taxes have increased to unprecedented levels. We are the laughing stock of the world economy&mdash;our waterfront obviously is as well, given the criticism over the weekend by international shipping companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know we are a country which has it all. We have got rich resources, natural beauty and skilled workers. Yet we are a country which has continued to slip back under this Labor government. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has attempted to hoodwink the Australian people into believing that we were going to have a budget surplus of something like $718 million. The real position is that the budget shows a deficit of around $8.5 billion. So this sale of the Commonwealth Bank is a desperate sell-off of the family jewels in order to continue this charade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record in relation to assets sales mirrors its dismal performance on other counts. The Labor Party has only managed to achieve $5.8 billion, or 53 per cent, of a projected total of $11 billion in sales since 1987-88. We sit back this year and wonder how the government, which only managed to sell $55 million in asset sales last year, will make the quantum leap to sell $5.4 billion in the space of a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that this bill is not going to be the final act of deception and double dealing by this government. Make no mistake, this government has an agenda to once again turn its back on its principles, as it does so well. Its aim is to see Telstra and Australia Post both with `for sale' signs in their shopfront windows. The coalition has made it perfectly clear that we have no intention of selling Australia Post, but make no mistake, this government would sell its grandmother in order to stay in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure we can all remember the letter which the Minister for Finance at the time, Mr Willis, included in the September 1993 prospectus for the Commonwealth Bank. He said, `The government has no intention of selling the Commonwealth Bank.' That was the assurance that this government gave all those mum and dad investors who were looking to invest their savings in the bank. I have to say that I was one of those people. I wish to declare an interest and say that I am one of the small shareholders who bought into the Commonwealth Bank at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government had no intention of selling the Commonwealth Bank, but today, two years later, we see a complete backflip by the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it was a false prospectus. I think that matter was raised at the time, but the minister was protected as a member of the government and nothing happened. I wonder sometimes whether Mr Willis had the same loss of memory that has inflicted other ministers in that other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course this is not the first time that the government has been dishonest. In 1986, when answering a question regarding our airlines, the then Minister for Aviation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure the honourable member that the Government's policy is that both Qantas and Trans Australia Airlines will remain in full public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>That was another Labor lie. It is evident that the minister's word once again meant nothing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator McGauran, $2 million a day. We know Mr Keating admitted on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program in June of 1994 that it makes no difference if Telstra is publicly or privately owned. There is a little inkling of what might happen further down the track if this Labor government is unfortunately returned to office. We could see Telstra lining up as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem whatsoever with the government adopting so willingly the policies of the coalition. We all know that the coalition policies have shown, in Victoria in particular, that asset sales, if properly conducted, can be of benefit in reducing the huge debts that the Labor Party has been running up in both the state of Victoria and also the Commonwealth. But you could argue, of course, that the government is at last starting to see some commonsense by privatising these public assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be remembered is that on every occasion to date that this government has made a firm commitment to do one thing their actions have been completely the opposite. What the government's actions show is that, more than ever, they cannot be trusted. Anyone in the Australian community who believes that the government is interested in, or indeed capable of, telling the truth really should take a long, hard look at the facts. Furthermore, when the government makes its election promises, people would do well to remember the great and long string of broken promises which have come out of the mouths of Labor ministers since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction of the Commonwealth Bank to the government's plans has from the start been understandably cautious, particularly in relation to the buyback option which has been pushed by the government. The bank sought to ensure that as a precursor there would be an independent examination of shareholders' approvals, that there would be a special resolution under Corporations Law or the Australian Stock Exchange listing rules as considered necessary by the bank board to deal with matters such as any necessary approvals from regulatory authorities, any selective buyback and any necessary amendments to the bank's memorandum and articles of association which remove all special rights to the Commonwealth. The bank also wanted to ensure that there would be agreement on the transition arrangements for the Commonwealth guarantee of the bank's liabilities and that there would be agreement on the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has most certainly not occurred, and today we are in this chamber debating a bill and I do not believe any of us present can say with any surety what the exact future of the bank is going to be. That position is indefensible. It is indefensible for the government and it pays absolutely no regard whatsoever to those small investors like myself and others who are such a vital component of the bank's structure. The fact that the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank hangs in the balance without any certainty is perhaps the most glaring of the government's failings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the Commonwealth Development Bank is not the bank of the high fliers or the multinationals; it is very much the bank of ordinary Australians, those in small business and those on the land. The importance of the Development Bank is recognised by a special charter in the Commonwealth Banks Act. The main role of this bank is to provide finance where it may not otherwise be available. It is a bank where what is important are cash flows and prospects rather than compulsory security. Its role is very much as its name would suggest, to aid in development.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are hundreds of thousands of farmers around Australia who have at one time or another been forced to use capital from the Commonwealth Development Bank and who still place a very important role on small business, as the minister at the table would know. So the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank is very important and is one of the major concerns that the coalition has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill we are debating today, the charter which existed before will no longer be law. We will have to rely instead upon a memorandum of association, which is to be part of the new Commonwealth Development Bank Ltd. The coalition, which is always mindful of the need to support those in small business and on the land, considers the proposed arrangements to be less than satisfactory. Even the explanatory memorandum recognises this fault in the present legislation in that it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>Our very genuine concerns are compounded because the memorandum further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank to undertake the banking activities defined in its charter.</PARA>
<PARA>We have absolutely no idea, however, what the level or type of this subsidy will be. All we have to go on is some vague notion relating to the shareholders agreement which is to be entered into by the Commonwealth and the bank before the transfer occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this goes anywhere near meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth Bank Board. It may well be that we will see the end of the Commonwealth Development Bank as we know it, and the coalition believes that this will have very serious consequences in denying small business, and the rural community in particular, access to a source of funding which has been critical to their growth over the years. There is, in fact, no guarantee that it will survive because the Commonwealth Bank Board has made it very clear in the past that it relies on the Commonwealth subsidy to successfully carry out the charter&mdash;in other words, no subsidy, no development bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 29 of the schedule to the bill repeals section 85A of the Commonwealth Bank Act, which provides for the grant of financial assistance from the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Some $41 million will be paid in subsidies by the end of the 1995-96 financial year. However, should that level of funding support be removed from the small business and rural sectors, obviously the effects would be very significant. It is ill conceived to deal with this bill before those matters are finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the memorandum can be amended under the Corporations Law, the Commonwealth Development Bank will be left with no option but to put all its loans on a strict commercial basis to the detriment of its existing clients. Because the Commonwealth is now trapped into selling the Commonwealth Bank in order to save any semblance of its budget predictions in the lead-up to the election, it has hatched up a plan to unload onto a privatised Commonwealth Bank a development bank, without any guarantee of subsidy and which, as a result, will have no choice but to place development on a totally commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, if the Commonwealth Bank decides to acquire the Commonwealth's shares in the Development Bank, it would be free to close down the operations of the Development Bank on the grounds that it did not consider the subsidy sufficient to meet its financial needs. In order to ensure that the future of the Development Bank is assured, the government must reveal before the parliament the full details of the proposed shareholders agreement and, in particular, it must be up front in regard to a commitment for future subsidies. Any terms associated with the shareholders agreement will also impact on any buyback of shares held by the Commonwealth before the balance of the shares go on sale to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank must inevitably have its funds depleted by the terms of the buyback, and those same funds may well come at the expense of the Development Bank. Such a figure could well approach $1 billion and, without a guarantee that the Commonwealth will continue to support the Development Bank, its future looks even more shaky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague in the other place, the member for MacKellar, Mrs Bishop, pointed out, it is totally unsatisfactory that the only time this parliament will see the shareholders agreement is when it is signed&mdash;although I now understand that it may be made available before being signed. If that is the case, I will wait to hear the minister give an explanation for it during the committee stage of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of foreign ownership also requires greater attention by the government. It is clear that the government has learnt little from the Qantas situation and as a result we continue to have in this bill a retrospective approach to dealing with a problem where the limit is exceeded. The coalition will not stand in the way of the second reading. I will move an amendment that raises the concerns that we have, but we certainly will not vote against the second reading. I want to make that clear right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of the Commonwealth Development Bank must be guaranteed but we must also ensure that it continues to undertake its present role in providing specialised assistance for rural communities and small business. We know that the small business of Australia looks to the coalition for support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we discuss this particular development bank and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank we should also consider how the AIDC could be utilised in the role of providing assistance to small business and rural export producers. Greater attention needs to be given to the issue of retrospectivity in the regulations. Finally, there is a need to resolve the issue of the shareholders' meeting&mdash;the government was previously of the view that it could be all done by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week when we started debating this bill I distributed a second reading amendment to be moved on behalf of the coalition. As I said, we will not vote against the second reading. I know amendments will be put forward by the Democrats. I will speak to those further during the committee stages. I would like to make it quite clear at the outset that the coalition will not support those amendments purely and simply because we believe they give too much power back to the Treasurer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am actually, Senator. You will have to look at the latest one. I think it is certainly time to sell the Commonwealth Bank. It was a very early Labor government which brought the Commonwealth Bank into being. It is entirely appropriate that it is this Labor government which finally pushes it out of the nest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first tranche of shares were put into the market in 1990. Since then we have also seen a very orderly market in the shares. We have also seen no intervention on the part of the government in the running of the bank. That is entirely appropriate because the bank has to compete on an equal basis with its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also worth the Senate remembering that the intervention by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on the subject of fees and charges for individual depositors has been very effective in recent weeks in changing the attitude not only of the Commonwealth Bank, which first proposed that those fees be raised, but also of other banks. I think it is indicative of the fact that in terms of regulation there is very little more that is now needed to ensure an efficient running of the banking system and also a banking system which meets the needs of the community and the needs of its customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do at this juncture want to compare the government's attitude to the selling of the Commonwealth Bank with the opposition's attitude to the selling of Telstra. I think it really does show in stark contrast the difference between the two sides of this Senate on the question of privatisation. The Commonwealth Bank is a mature business in a very mature industry. It has really reached an appropriate level in its development where the amount of change it is going to face in the foreseeable future is far less than that which it has faced in the recent past. On the other hand, Telstra is a fast growing company in a very rapidly changing business sector. It is in the infant industry of communications. It is for that reason, I believe, the government wants to retain Telstra, despite the fact that the opposition wants to sell it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at what has happened to the Commonwealth Bank and, more particularly, the banking industry over the last few years, we see that the major regulatory changes are behind us. The 1980s were a period of very rapid deregulation in banking, not only in Australia but around the world. All the banks changed&mdash;they changed in their attitudes to their customers, they changed in their attitudes to the community in general and they certainly changed in the services they provided and the way in which they operated. The Commonwealth Bank changed with them. There were certainly some mistakes made during that period of change in the 1980s and many lessons were learnt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is often forgotten that the foreign banks which this government allowed to enter the market during the 1980s bore considerable losses as a result of the mistakes they made&mdash;the sort of losses which no Australian would be particularly enthusiastic about Australian banks bearing. But that was the price they were prepared to pay to come into the Australian market and embrace a completely new world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen considerable benefits to consumers as a result of the changes of the 1980s. Borrowers have seen the end of the savings book account which paid one or two per cent interest, at the same time as borrowers were required to pay 12 or 13 per cent on their home loans. That gap between borrowing rates and deposit rates closed as a function of the deregulation that we saw in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen businesses have available to them products which were inconceivable 20 or 30 years ago, and certainly when the Commonwealth Bank was first thought of. These risk management products are based on derivative markets which have seen phenomenal growth. Again, I think we can say they have developed in an orderly fashion, they are at a mature stage now and they are available to all banks and all customers of those banks. The net result has been a Commonwealth Bank which is now more profitable than it has ever been, which is showing a better return on its capital than it ever has, and one which the stock market has given its approval to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you contrast that with the telecommunications industry, it is obvious that that industry and the major players in it are still evolving. The growth in that industry is absolute phenomenal. We can hardly imagine now what products will be available to consumers in 10 years or even 15 years time. The rate of change is absolutely extraordinary. At that point, and because of that change, there is still a public interest that has to be protected. To abandon Telstra now is really to say, `We don't really care about the rate of change, we don't care what the products might be and we don't care about the players in that market and what future they might have.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at what the opposition is doing, the opposition has ummed and ahed about its policy, but I can tell you now, Mr Acting Deputy President, what the opposition's policy is on telecommunications&mdash;it is to raise as much money as possible for the next election. The opposition simply wants to sell Telstra because it wants to outbid the government in the coming election campaign. It wants to have a huge sack of money on its side so that it can go into the marketplace and essentially bribe the electorate by saying, `We can outspend those on the other side because we have sold Telstra, and we will use that money for that purpose.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite elated when Senator Tierney said a policy had actually been announced on telecommunications by the opposition last week. With great enthusiasm I rushed to the faxes but, sadly, I found it only related to a two-line statement by Mr Howard in a speech to the National Farmers Federation. In fact, I can read this policy in its absolute entirety. It was far less than I had hoped for and, indeed, than the public deserves. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges by 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 target date.</PARA>
<PARA>How can you suddenly decide to sell Telstra&mdash;and, what is more, you are not going to sell Telstra because it is a mature business, you are not going to do it because you think Telstra will provide the best return to the public now, you will do it simply because you want to get as much money as you possibly can for the coming election campaign. The two things are completely contradictory. You cannot talk, as Senator Calvert did, about public interest, what banks should be doing and what the Commonwealth Development Bank might be doing and, in the same breath, say you are going to sell Telstra with the sole aim of getting as much money for it as you possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what the government is doing in selling the Commonwealth Bank now is redeploying in a responsible way Commonwealth funds&mdash;some $4 1/2 billion, if current share price values hold up&mdash;to reduce its borrowings and to maintain a sound fiscal policy. It stands in stark contrast when a government responsibly sees that a government owned entity is at the end of its life, it is in a mature phase and it can take its place in the private market. Compare that with Telstra. We cannot envisage its shape within five or even 10 years time. To sell that purely for the purposes of raising money to fund your election promises, I believe, is irresponsible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the extraordinarily important bill which is before the Senate&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. I look forward to voting on this bill with the government and Senator Wheelwright, Senator Carr, Senator Coates, Senator Schacht and all those who have complained over the years that maybe the coalition would sell the Commonwealth Bank. It is a day I look forward to. The sooner we vote on this bill, the better. I assume the Democrats will call for a division and then Senator Wheelwright and I can vote together on this important bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Wheelwright's complaints about the privatisation of Telstra. That took me back to the Ben Chifley speech given by former Prime Minister Mr Hawke not so long ago. He gave that speech in September 1987. Senator Wheelwright's speech reminded me of that Chifley lecture. Former Prime Minister Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas? As the people of Australia come to realise the extent of the economic and social vandalism proposed by our opponents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The vandalism that he was talking about included the vandalism of suing the Commonwealth Bank. I can understand why Senator Wheelwright, as a former stockbroker, recognises the potential advantages to a future government in selling Telstra. Most Telecoms around the world are privatised. I would have liked Senator Wheelwright to have addressed the issue of why it is in this great nation of ours that Telecom should remain exclusively in the public sector and not even have a proportion of its shares sold and why it is that other countries have effectively privatised their Telecoms. It would have been interesting if you had grappled with that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had these scare tactics before. The trouble is that no-one believes you. In Victoria the Labor Party rails against Premier Kennett for this and that. In Canberra we find that the Labor Party is privatising this and that&mdash;and there are some big chunks that are being privatised. There was an extraordinary incident the other week when Senator Wheelwright was on our side of the chamber and I was on the opposite side of the chamber and he was voting for the privatisation of Sydney airport. Because of a difficulty, we did not vote together on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of his party's record, I would have thought Senator Wheelwright would have been more cautious when going on the record and saying what he did. Your party is a great privatiser despite what it says in elections. The Labor Party does not worry too much about what it says in elections. In the hugely unlikely circumstance that the Labor Party wins an election in the next 10 years or wins the next election, there is no question that the Labor Party would sell Telstra. We would stand up then and quote all the speeches you have made. You would be working out whether or not to come into the chamber and how to distinguish between what you would say then and what you have said now. The Labor Party has no credibility on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember Senator Evans in this chamber boasting. He said, `Now we have sold the Commonwealth Bank, there is nothing left for you to privatise.' He had gone through all of these things the Labor Party had privatised which they said before every election they would not privatise, and then they came back and decided they would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Wheelwright, I think it has to be said that the contributions you make to this chamber are actually more thoughtful than those of a lot of those made by your colleagues. I do not argue with that. I think your speeches are interesting typically, but on this one I would have to say that you fell dramatically. You should have at least, out of deference to the public interest, explained why the Labor Party had so totally reversed its position&mdash;economic vandalism from Mr Hawke one day; responsible government policy from Mr Keating the next. You might all refer to the former Prime Minister as Marcel Marceau, but at least he put that position. You have utterly changed course on it; you have backflipped. You have flipped onto the privatisation thing with a vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You did not explain to us why it was so important to Mr Hawke in his Chifley speech&mdash;and Senator Schacht undoubtedly went around in the 1990 election. I remember Commonwealth Bank officers saying, `Don't vote for Senator Kemp because he is going to privatise the Commonwealth Bank.' All your party did that&mdash;you probably did not do it because in a sense you were not on the campaign trail. But we are all aware of this history; we all know the immense baggage that the Labor Party carries on this. The great icon of the government enterprises was the Commonwealth Bank. You have sold that and you are about to sell more, so no-one believes you on these other issues now. Why should they, given the whole history?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be ungenerous about this bill. I will be looking forward to voting with Senator Wheelwright on this bill. They have adopted our policy. They went into the Liberal Party supermarket and said, `We're bereft of policy initiatives, so what can we borrow from the Liberal Party?' They said, `It doesn't make sense in the modern world,'&mdash;and I think it is correct&mdash;`to have major banking facilities in the public sector.' So you adopted the Liberal Party policy ungraciously. There was no hint in your speech that you had done one almighty backflip, but because you got into the Telecom-Telstra issue, it did remind us of the Chifley speech and how far the Keating Labor Party has changed on privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is extraordinary that the Socialist Left seems to be so accepting of all this. Someone said to me that in 13 years of government the Socialist Left has become more like the social left, and I think that probably is the case. I do not see Senator Carr speaking on this bill. It would have been interesting to hear him speak. He rails against privatisation in Victoria, but he comes to Canberra and he votes for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public will have to judge the sincerity of that approach. It is no wonder the Labor Party is struggling. No-one knows what they stand for. In elections they are not going to privatise anything. After the election, it is Qantas out the door, and then the Commonwealth Bank is facing very big privatisation. As I said, I am not going to be ungracious about this important bill. The Labor Party has adopted, by and large, Liberal Party policy on these sorts of issues, and I look forward to voting with Senator Wheelwright when the bill is finalised in this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is often because we do have a great backlog of legislation facing the Senate, and perhaps because the major parties are supporting this Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill, that we are guilty of overlooking the significance of bills that pass through this place. But this bill really must have some status in the parliament as it is the final sale of the historic Commonwealth Bank. To that end, it is a discredit to the government that the best they could do was wheel in Senator Wheelwright as the only speaker on the government side. They could only muster up one new backbench senator to speak on behalf of the government's policy. Even then, he was apologetic for the time he was taking up in the Senate, and I think he was more embarrassed by the fact that he could not get any supporters to speak with him on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a credit to Senator Wheelwright that he made an attempt and he put together a relatively good argument for the government, but it is a discredit to those on the government side who did not contribute to this debate&mdash;in particular, as Senator Kemp pointed out, those senators from the Socialist Left who have for years feigned their support for the Commonwealth Bank; in fact, made it a cornerstone of their philosophy. It has been an integral part of the Socialist Left philosophy, and not one of them has even entered the chamber during this most important and significant debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank does have an important place in Australian history. Its worth has been quite significant in Australian history over those years and, in many respects, it has been a romanticised bank. This has much to do with the beginnings of the bank itself, which go back as far as 1912, when it was introduced by a Labor government via the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911. In his second reading speech, Andrew Fisher, the then Prime Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be a bank belonging to the people, and directly managed by the people's own agents.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our chief aim is not to make profits, but to insure safety and security to depositors.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, banking has come a long way from those lofty ideals, particularly `our chief aim is not to make profits'. At the very least, the perception of this bank has been fulfilled. Its role has been fulfilled in the community, at least by perception. It has always been a popular bank, particularly in many of the rural areas. It has had a very special affinity throughout its history in rural Australia. This was really borne out when the first allotment of shares were offered to the public. It is true to say that the shares were snapped up by the mums and dads market, way above their par value and much to the surprise of the markets and even more to the surprise of a very revenue hungry government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the measure of how people in Australia really do attach themselves to banks. We saw this when the Victorian State Bank collapsed around 1990. Ironically, this bank was saved by the Commonwealth Bank. But the customers of that Victorian bank had such an affinity with the State Bank that it was quite obvious that they were going to discriminate in respect of what bank they would belong to. After the takeover of the Victorian State Bank, most of the customers moved across to the Bank of Melbourne, believing that they were keeping their money in their state. So customers or clients do discriminate against banks. Certain banks are more popular than others and it is true to say that the Commonwealth Bank has been a popular bank since its establishment in 1912. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this, it is incumbent upon the government to state clearly the fate of the equally vital Commonwealth Development Bank. This bank has had a very special and significant part to play for the National Party, in particular, because its history goes back to its establishment by the National Party leader, Artie Fadden. It was described by Fadden as a vehicle to `provide finance to assist primary production or the establishment of industrial undertakings in cases where the provision of finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions'. The charter of the Commonwealth Bank placed emphasis on small undertakings, even when the borrower's security did not meet the requirements of the other banks. The bank was established in January 1960. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out by Senator Calvert quite well, while the share capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue to be 91.9 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, the explanatory memorandum states that the bill does not define the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 does not define the annual subsidy arrangements for the Commonwealth Development Bank. These arrangements will be defined in the Shareholders Agreement (the agreement) to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank before the transfer time.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be laying the foundations for the Commonwealth Bank to walk away from the subsidy arrangements and terminate the specialist lending facilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank. Those subsidy arrangements are critical to the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 annual report records that the Commonwealth Development Bank received a subsidy of $20 million in the year ended 30 June 1994. The 1995-96 budget papers show that a similar sum of money was to be provided. More specifically, in the 1995 annual report the Commonwealth Bank states in relation to this vital subsidy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to the outcome of the Government's review . . . Its $20 million subsidy remains subject to annual appropriation of the government.</PARA>
<PARA>So we can see the set-up. Buried in the same report is an even more telling comment entitled `Looking forward'. It really does tell the story. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as noted at page 5, the future of the Development Bank is currently the subject of review by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It is doubtful that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) would tell us anything about the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank as he is given to misleading us over the very sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Back in September 1993, Mr Willis reaffirmed his very strong position taken in relation to the government's commitment never to reduce the Commonwealth's holding in the Commonwealth Bank. In a letter which was included in the prospectus for the sale of the second tranche of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Willis assured prospective investors:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has no intentions whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it took only one budget after that for the government to put the bank up for sale. Nevertheless, we ask the government: what is the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we want is for the government to do to the Commonwealth Development Bank what they have managed to do to the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The privatisation of the AIDC rivals the very fiasco of ANL, which we debated in this house just a week ago. As the parliament would be aware in relation to ANL, as each day goes by and an agreement is not achieved between the Commonwealth, P&amp;O and, I suppose, the unions as the third party, taxpayers lose $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the AIDC, the government got halfway down the track to privatising it with the sale of some 20 per cent of shares to private hands when they announced a complete turnaround and attempted to renationalise the AIDC. Who knows what its future is. Clearly, those who purchased shares in the corporation at that time are the losers, particularly now that those minority shareholders are under pressure to accept an offer or see the government withdraw its guarantee by 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very worth while to note that, while those minority shareholders look like being the losers in this debacle, the board and executives do not. After 1994, when the decision for the sale was certain, the board decided to hand out pay rises of up 200 per cent and more. In particular, the chief executive went from earning $320,000 to earning $1.8 million in one hop. There was a similar increase for other key staff. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament can see from that that the government has a very poor record when it comes to asset sales and privatisation. From 1991, when basically this privatisation program gathered its momentum, to 1994-95, they have never reached their targeted budget announcement. In 1991 they budgeted for $1 billion worth of asset sales. They achieved $162 million. In 1991-92 they budgeted for $625 million of asset sales. They reached half of that figure. In 1992-93 they budgeted for $1.6 billion worth of asset sales. They reached $800 million. In 1993-94 they budgeted for a very cautious $2.4 billion. They did not get close to that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding the government that the sale of the Commonwealth Bank was used in the last budget as the deciding factor, late as it was, to bring the government's budget into surplus by some $718 million. That amount was always recognised as an attempt to gild the lily. The actuals are now in since that budget. The budget has not reached and will not reach its surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that for a fact because in October the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, Mr O'Keefe, introduced legislation to obtain the parliament's approval to appropriate additional moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenses additional to those already appropriated in 1995-96. They are already looking for some $917 million extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amount is made up not only by a slower growth rate and therefore less revenue but also by the failure of the AIDC sale. Some $200 million has contributed to the government now not looking like it is going to get its $718 million surplus. It will probably be the reverse&mdash;a $718 million deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank was the key to the government's budget strategies. With the deregulation of the financial sector in the 1980s it was unavoidable that the bank would and should be privatised. We support that. It enters the market as one of Australia `s top four banks. Its financial position is such that it is set to take No. 2 after the National Bank, if it does not already hold that position. I believe that a competitive, efficient Commonwealth Bank, through privatisation, will further add to banking competition, to the long-term benefits of clients and shareholders alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with an unbridled Commonwealth Bank in the marketplace, it is critical that the banks are subject to the strongest competition. After the PSA had produced its bank charges report calling upon the banks to show some discipline in relation to client charges, within a very short time, less than a month, the Commonwealth Bank put up its charges. This did not give much hope for self-regulation. It was only because the parliament and the government had some control, some shares still left in the Commonwealth Bank, that they were able to pull them into line and reverse that decision. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most tangible benefits of deregulation of the financial sector has been the rise of the smaller banks and the regional banks. The first major test in this sector came some months ago when Westpac made a takeover bid for Western Australia's Challenge Bank against the New South Wales smaller regional bank the St George Bank. To say the least, this caused ripples in the financial markets, as it was to set the stage, were that takeover to be unfettered, for the big four to take over all the regionals and therefore, without doubt, lessen competition in the financial sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was referred to the Trade Practices Commission, now the ACCC, on the grounds of section 50: lessening competition. I am pleased to say that, while that particular takeover bid was given the green light, the Trade Practices Commission, or the ACCC as it is now, laid down future competition rules. This takeover gave them the opportunity to lay down future competition rules. Fundamentally, the decision was to protect the smaller regional banks, as they were seen to bring competition to the marketplace. At least one state must have one major regional bank. In my state it will be the Bank of Melbourne. On balance, the decision was good enough and it will keep the banking sector healthy and competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that today we are debating the last step in the government's total privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. I remember being here to see the lot of it. People have talked about the way in which the Labor government has changed its policy on this. What we are seeing here is another example of this government's bailing out of its responsibility in this area for short-term dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are often good reasons for supporting the sale of assets. The Australian Democrats cannot see too many good reasons for supporting the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Most people seem to have caved in to the privatisation argument in this country. I am asked, `Why don't you just give in? Why do you continue to oppose some of these things?' Despite what Senator McGauran has said, I say the evidence is that the recent history of banking in this country has proven it to be non-competitive. The Reserve Bank said so itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent history of banking has highlighted the need for pro-active government intervention to improve competition. Senator McGauran tells us that competition will come. They told us that in 1983. They said, `Deregulate. Competition improves consumer services. It will all come.' It is 12 years down the track and we are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that in a non-competitive environment the government has a responsibility and a role in setting some standards. If we take the example of superannuation and its recent history in this country, we see that the only way the government could get the superannuation funds to deliver a fairer deal on fees was by threatening to use the Taxation Office as a competitor. That is one reason why we believe the government should not give up one of the few means of influence it has over banking in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politics of this bill are interesting. It was included in the 1995 budget&mdash;it seems, at the very last moment&mdash;to allow the Treasurer, Mr Willis, to announce the magic but deceptive and illusory surplus. I am told that it was included in the budget only after the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) gave a nudge and a wink behind the Speaker's chair, agreeing not to oppose it. The sale of one of this country's most important and influential assets was announced without ever being considered by the backbench of the government or, as I understand it, by the backbench of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they vote for this today, I wonder whether Labor senators will reflect on the fact that they are dismantling one of Labor's proudest legacies&mdash;the legacy of Andrew Fisher and King O'Malley&mdash;the people's bank. I accept that times change. However, this bill represents a sanctioned watering down of ALP policy and breaches an undertaking given to earlier purchasers of Commonwealth Bank shares that government ownership would not be reduced. Those who vote for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank will be placing small business and farming finance in limbo by also agreeing to sell the Commonwealth Development Bank without its future role being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who vote for this bill will also be sanctioning the fact that it is okay for governments to give up scope for the possible influence of competition in the banking industry by allowing the Commonwealth Bank to run on lower margins, lower fees, with more innovative products and greater accountability to consumers. I recall during the last election campaign the very important commitment given by the ALP, in response to Fightback, that the ALP was not in the wholesale privatisation business. It is a bit hard to remember that when we have had the ANL and airports bills in the Senate over the last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the opposition has made no secret of its long-term plan to sell the Commonwealth Bank. The National Party has always expressed concern about what that could mean for the Commonwealth Development Bank, the farmer's friend, the lender of last resort to farming and small business communities. In the debate in the other place, one National Party frontbencher, Mr Bruce Scott, said that the sale:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will almost certainly have an impact on the nation's rural and small business people.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it represents another slap in the face for those people and their families who have plunged ever deeper into financial and social crisis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>over the last 13 years. But, guess what? He voted for it. I bet Senator McGauran does too, despite all the vigorous questioning he will undertake in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you why the National Party will vote for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, which includes the sale of the Commonwealth Development Bank. It is because they have to take the view that coalition stability is more important than the concerns of their constituents. The Democrats believe that the Commonwealth Development Bank is too important an institution to be trifled with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us repeals the legislation governing the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as the lender of last resort and the provisions underpinning the government's subsidy. We are told that these provisions will be subject to a memorandum between the bank and the government at a later stage. In the committee stage, Senator McGauran might like to pursue that line of questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether he has seen the Commonwealth Bank's 1995 report. I wonder whether he would agree with me that the bank does not seem to be terribly keen about being saddled with the low margin nature of the Commonwealth Development Bank's activities. The Commonwealth Bank's annual report notes that the Commonwealth Development Bank is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . currently the subject of a review by the Government. The Bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it.</PARA>
<PARA>The message there is clear&mdash;it is clear to me&mdash;that the bank will be putting pressure on to maximise the subsidy and minimise the obligations to assist rural and small business operators. I wonder whether the National Party really wants to assist by acquiescing in what is clearly the first stage of the dismantling of the Commonwealth Development Bank as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give Senator McGauran an opportunity to vote for our amendment. With our proposal we want to guarantee the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. Under our amendment it would not be swinging in the breeze depending on bank management and the federal Treasurer holding their word on it. Rather, we would propose by our amendment that the role could not be changed without the approval of parliament itself and, through parliament, the input of affected rural and small business sectors. Let us see when the vote comes how genuinely concerned the National Party is about these sectors. Let us see whether it is a matter of mouthing platitudes and then voting differently and hoping that people out there in the bush will not notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sale bill is also an opportunity to see how seriously we feel about corporate honesty and behaviour. There has been a lot of talk over the lifting of standards of corporate behaviour, particularly in relation to undertakings in prospectuses, et cetera. Here we have a majority shareholder&mdash;the government&mdash;selling its shares, going back deliberately on a commitment it gave just 20 months ago that it would not sell its share in the bank. Thousands of mum and dad investors all over Australia lined up to buy Commonwealth Bank shares in the knowledge that the government had given an ironclad guarantee that government majority ownership would be preserved, along with the guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then finance minister, Ralph Willis, in a letter included in the prospectus, said, `The government has no intention whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding.' What a joke&mdash;20 months! This was confirmed in l-a-w law in the Commonwealth Banks Act, section 27L, which requires the government to remain the majority shareholder. But today, as I said, 20 months later, we are asked to repeal that section. We are asked to sanction Mr Willis's breach of an undertaking on which many shareholders probably acted in purchasing their shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot was said at the time. I remember Mr Peter Costello saying that, if Mr Willis were the director of a private company, he would be facing an Australian Securities Commission investigation and a possible five-year gaol sentence for a possible breach of section 996 of the Corporations Law for false and misleading statements in a prospectus. I am not a legal expert. While there is an argument that technically the government is not in breach of the Corporations Law or trade practices law, it remains the case that it is a very poor example to set for the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Company directors would be entitled to ask why it is that someone who is running the country does not have to comply with the kinds of laws that someone running a company has to. They would also want to know why the opposition, after making such a fuss, has backed down and decided to sanction this by voting for this sale bill. What sort of message does that send to the corporate sector&mdash;that it is okay to say anything in a prospectus?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Commonwealth Bank could play a significant role in forcing the pace of competition in the marketplace. A government controlled bank not required to maximise profits could set new benchmarks in terms of maximising service and value for money. In the past, with its commitment to housing finance, to promoting household savings, to maintaining a presence in country towns and to looking after small savers and small businesses, the Commonwealth Bank did fulfil this role. All over Australia people are asking who is going to do it now. With financial deregulation and corporatisation, the Commonwealth Bank has progressively shed this traditional role. The Democrats think that has been a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go to the economic arguments, the Commonwealth Bank is a very profitable institution. This year its after tax profit was just under $1 billion. In the previous four years it averaged an annual profit of over $600 million. That is an income stream that is owned by Australian taxpayers. In selling off the bank, the government chooses to deprive Australian taxpayers of that income stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse, as Dr John Quiggin and Professor Bob Walker have pointed out, in privatisation decisions this government and other governments are forced to sell their assets for much less than their net present value to the government because of the different taxation and borrowing status of would-be private investors. Not only do we sell it off and lose the income stream; we sell it at a lower price than it is worth, losing a second income stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In selling the Commonwealth Bank, we lose the potential to influence the behaviour of our banking market. Why shouldn't we be worried about that? We lose the potential to keep the biggest and most popular personal banking house in this country from exposing itself to corporate and merchant banking in an inappropriate way. We lose the potential income stream. We kick sand in the eyes of rural and small business borrowers. And we sanction what some people have called the most massive deception of shareholders acting on a prospectus in recent Australian corporate history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Democrats, they are some very good reasons for voting down this bill. As I say, I urge National Party senators who have voiced concerns about this, I urge those who are interested in public finance and corporate governance, I urge those who are interested in improving the competitiveness of our banking sector to join with the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine in voting this bill down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the opposition's second reading amendment, I make the following few comments. On part (a), that the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank is ill-defined and it should be included as a schedule, the Democrats share the concern of the opposition in that respect but we believe the Senate should go further than a mere second reading amendment and legislate to ensure that the Commonwealth Development Bank cannot be watered down by the bank itself or by a future federal Treasurer. It does not take long to learn in this place that treasurers do not keep their commitments on things to do with the Commonwealth Bank; for example, in this case a commitment kept for not more than 20 months. If the Treasurer had kept his word, this bill would not be before us today. While sympathetic with part (a), I do not believe it goes far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to part (b), I wonder whether this is a misunderstanding. Senator Calvert is not here, but no doubt he can tell me. As I understand it, the probable buyback will require the approval of 75 per cent of shareholders. I think this hardly places it in the category of compulsory acquisition. Therefore, I do not think the case for part (b) of this amendment has been satisfactorily made out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On part (c), the potentially retrospective nature of the regulation making power in this bill has already been the subject of a report by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Democrats do not accept the government's argument that the government wants to grant this power to ensure that, if it makes mistakes because it has cut so many corners on the sale processes already, it can retrospectively fix them. I do not think it is appropriate. It sets a bad precedent, even if the regulation is disallowable. I wonder why the opposition wishes to proceed with this item as a second reading amendment rather than as a bone fide amendment, as suggested by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Democrats cannot support this second reading amendment in its present form, particularly part (b). However, I reiterate that, irrespective of a successful second reading amendment, we should not be voting for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Bank was founded in very different times from those today. It was founded at a time when it was thought appropriate to have a government run bank, and there was a lot of merit in that proposition. But what was appropriate in the 1930s faces grave difficulties when confronted by the realities of the 1990s. It is a reality that the financial world is becoming increasingly internationalised. Be it for good or for ill, those are the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that we could somehow return to a situation where the Commonwealth could print money, as some people advocate to me in letters, or that we should have a bank run by the Commonwealth which somehow sits apart from the mainstream banking world whilst still being a broad based retail bank is, unfortunately, an untenable proposition. The fact is that we have to recognise the change in the international financial situation. In the same way as it is impossible these days to defend fixed rates of exchange, so too is it unrealistic for us to say that we believe the Commonwealth Bank should somehow remain as some protected fiefdom, whilst all around it banks are changing, growing and becoming more powerful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the grave dangers is that, if we take the view that the Commonwealth Bank should be kept as a government run entity, we run the very real risk of one of our major Australian retail banks failing to have the opportunities to develop overseas in the way that other Australian banks are doing at the moment. If we look at the recent purchase by the National Australia Bank of a $2 billion banking operation in the United States, we can see how the opportunities existing in the private sector have resulted in more power, more leverage not only for that bank but for the Australian banking sector overseas. In an international world, that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are sound reasons why the coalition supports the general thrust of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, but there are points that should also be made about it. When the government first floated its stake in the Commonwealth Bank, it gave undertakings that it would not float a further stake&mdash;and then that undertaking was broken. That undertaking has been broken to the detriment of shareholders who went into the first tranche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that, I think there is a very clear message in terms of the manner in which the privatisation should proceed. When the rest of the government stake in the Commonwealth Bank is sold, it must quite clearly be sold as one tranche and not as two. Why do I say that? Very simply, the role that the government should place on whichever bank does the privatisation must be a very clear one: so far as is possible, it must be to maximise the sale proceeds for the Commonwealth and also for the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you sell it as two tranches, then demand for the first tranche will be depressed because every buyer who goes into that first tranche will know that there is a further tranche in the wings, that there will be additional supply. Therefore, institutional demand for the first tranche of shares will be lower. It is quite reasonable to say that, by selling in two tranches, you could well end up with the result of five to 10 per cent less than would have been achieved if it had been sold as one tranche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is based on an assumption that it is possible to sell all of the remaining stake in one tranche. But if one looks at the market around the world for privatisations at the moment&mdash;which is ferocious; there is a voracious appetite out there for stakes in newly privatised government business entities&mdash;it is perfectly reasonable to say that it is achievable for us to sell the remaining equity in one tranche.Certainly, I know from my contacts in the banking industry that that is a view that many banks have&mdash;that it should be sold as one tranche. That is something that the government should take into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to make a point about the timing of this sale. Last week those of us in the opposition were treated to an extraordinary display from the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cook. He rose to tell the Senate that the opposition was financially and fiscally profligate&mdash;and this is what he said&mdash;for the simple reason, he claimed, that the opposition would hold up the sale of the airports and, therefore, damage the bottom line position of this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Senator Cook's assertion that the coalition would damage the budget outcome for 1995-96. Fortunately, my friend Senator Short rose and corrected Senator Cook and pointed out that in fact the sale of the airports is not scheduled to occur until 1996-97. In other words, there was no damage being done to the bottom line of the budget. Of course, we all know the sale of the airports can go ahead as soon as the government wishes to meet the concerns that we in the opposition have. We are not blocking it; we are merely saying it is appropriate for the parliament to place some conditions on these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out what was said by the government a couple of weeks ago to those banks that made presentations in relation to this privatisation. Mr Willis had all the banks lined up here in Canberra. They all came and made their presentations, suggesting how they believed this privatisation should take place. In the process, those banks were told by the Treasurer when they asked about the timing of the float that it would not occur until after the election irrespective of when that election was held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the assumption that the earliest date the election could be held is now somewhere around about March and given the election could now be as late as May because the government has already said it will put off the budget until August, it is blatantly obvious to anybody who makes the slightest inquiry that the sale of the Commonwealth Bank will not happen this financial year. Why is that important? I will tell you why that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget that was delivered in May, the government relied on selling at least one tranche of the Commonwealth Bank in this current financial year. The estimates of the value of the remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank range from $4 billion to $5 billion. Assuming the first tranche was less than the second tranche, which is one of the things we will probably have to do in order to maximise the overall return on the assets, it is very clear that by the government's own delay this budget will have between $1.6 billion and $2 billion punched out of it because the sale of the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank will not occur this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want all of the scribes in the press gallery to take note of the fact that this government's budget will be in deficit not because of anything the coalition has done but because the government itself was incapable of proceeding with the remaining privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank as it planned. I predict quite confidently that the budget deficit outcome for this financial year will exceed $2 billion because of the additional spending pledges that have been made by the Prime Minister and because of the fact that just a couple of weeks ago the Treasurer told the banks bidding for this privatisation it would not occur until after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally impossible to expect that even a portion, even the first tranche of the remaining Commonwealth equity in the Commonwealth Bank, could be sold in three months. Assuming an election was held in March, the new government would be in office by the beginning of April. But that would only give them April, May and June in which to not only plan and implement the sale strategy but also bring that money into the Commonwealth coffers. It is quite obvious that this government, through its own ineptitude, has now punched a $1.6 billion to $2 billion hole in the Commonwealth's government budget position. I believe that is a fact that Australians should be made aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reason why this government has delayed this sale. That reason is simply this: the government had no intention of bringing that money into the budget this year. The government's intention always was that it would occur in the next financial year. Hence, the statement it will be sold in two tranches&mdash;one this financial year and one next financial year. It was always the intention that that stake would be sold in the next financial year. It was always the government's intention to include in the budget estimates money that the government knew it would never get in, so it could say to the Australian people, `We have produced this year a budget surplus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was a surplus in estimate only and a dishonest estimate at that because the facts are that it will not happen. Next financial year the government was rather hoping it would be elected so it could bring the same sale proceeds into the budget twice and say in the next financial year, `Aren't we wonderful financial managers; we have achieved such a great turnaround on the 1995-96 result'&mdash;which, of course, was always going to be a deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why the government has done it the way it has. That is the reason why the Commonwealth was unwilling to put an actual estimate on the value to the budget this year of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. They did not want to put an accurate figure on it because they knew it would then be possible for the opposition to quantify the amount of money that would be lost from the bottom-line position before we got to the election. It was always intended to be an exercise in deception. But from a government which has excelled at deception, what should surprise us about that? So we see this lovely little fiscal charade from the government where they pretend to privatise something this year, privatise it the following year, bring the figures into the budget twice, and make themselves look like angels when we know they are far from angels when it comes to fiscal management. That has been the strategy of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other factor which has been behind the government's thinking on this. It is quite simply that the government knows that amongst its voters, amongst its heartland, the sale of the Commonwealth Bank is a very, very contentious issue. There are many people who form the view that the Commonwealth Bank is rather like the family silver&mdash;that you should not sell it. So, rather than having an unseemly factional brawl in the ALP in the lead-up to the election, what did this strong, powerful government that was going to exercise national leadership in the interests of all Australians do? It put it off because it was the easy thing to do. Rather than making the tough decisions, rather than seeing that privatisation occur this financial year, rather than seeing it happen before the budget, the government decided, `We will put it off.' It helped them dodgy up the figures for the budget and it helps them avoid contention in their own party and amongst their own supporters because of what they are doing to the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That exposes the duplicity and the dishonesty of this government&mdash;that they are unwilling to tell the Australian people what they are doing, they are unwilling to be honest in their budget estimates and they are unwilling to make the tough decisions necessary for the future of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that greatly disappoints me is that this government has so far squandered the proceeds of asset sales in recurrent spending. In other words, assets that have been built up through taxpayer contributions, through investment by government, assets that have been built up, put away and saved, have been wantonly squandered to pay for government election promises, to pay for recurrent spending&mdash;not to pay for infrastructure, not to be reinvested in new assets, but used to fund this or that government scheme so that they can run around, wring their hands and say they are concerned about Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government has a sense of conscience, the real concern for Australia should be shown and achieved by reinvesting the sale proceeds, as the coalition is committed to doing, or by paying off government debt, not squandering it on a political holiday, which is what we are seeing at the moment. The future of this nation is such that Australia's fate is in the balance. A continuation of the fiscal profligacy of the Labor Party can only result in one thing&mdash;a lower standard of living for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank sale, just like the sale of the airports, is proof that Australia needs sound financial management. Instead of seeing a wanton, wilful and wasteful Labor government, Australia needs a coalition government now more than at any time in the past, a coalition government that will make the right decisions for the benefit of all Australians, not just for the benefit of the Labor Party's factional disputes. That is what we need. That is why this government is shameful and wasteful, and that is why they must be thrown out at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that in the last few days two of Australia's most respected business leaders have given the Keating government the thumbs down. First, retiring Woolworths chairman, Paul Simons, said that the economy is fragile, and yesterday the ANZ Bank chief, Don Mercer, attacked the government on its superannuation and micro-economic reform policies and its inability to deliver a responsible budget surplus. Why should the Australian community not believe Mr Mercer when he says that the government's failed policies are likely to cause a rise in interest rates next year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the government does not speculate on interest rates and Senator Short knows that. This is a provocative question. He is playing politics once again. It has nothing to do with real information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Don Mercer did say a few things about the Australian economy yesterday. If the opposition, as it sometimes does, describes the Australian economy as highly vulnerable, then I wonder how they would rate an economy with an average growth over five years of 2 1/2 per cent and inflation of 10 per cent. How would they rate an economy of that sort? That is what their leader, Mr Howard, achieved when he was Treasurer. Under his economic stewardship, the average real economic growth rate was 2 1/2 per cent and the average inflation rate was 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this week the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the latest national accounts data. After four years of continuous economic growth, this data is expected to show that the economy has chalked up yet another quarter of economic growth. All the signs are that the economy is set to continue growing not just for several more quarters but indeed for several more years. It should be noted that, even with the recent moderation in growth, Australia still has one of the fastest growing economies in the whole OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition to long-term sustainable growth is now being reflected in the economic data. The data show activity moderating in some sectors, such as in the housing industry, and in some regions. However, one of the hallmarks of sustainable growth is that those parts of the economy with moderating levels of activity are matched by others in which activity is growing strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, as housing construction started to decline last year non-dwelling construction began to pick up and is now growing strongly. Robust exports and the rural recovery are also showing important sources of strength to the economy. The transition earlier this year from extremely high unsustainable levels of growth to more moderate but still strong levels of growth is only now being reflected in the labour force data. That is because employment, as a lagging indicator, provides a better measure of where the economy has been in the recent past rather than where the economy is now or where it will be in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this question Senator Short also referred to superannuation, and Mr Mercer made some remarks about superannuation in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> interview yesterday. What should be remembered is that Mr Mercer was speaking for the banks. The banks have an obligation to their shareholders to make a profit and distribute the profit to their shareholders; superannuation funds&mdash;to whom he was not so kind&mdash;have an obligation not to make a profit and, through their trustees, to distribute the advantages to their members. That is an important distinction when one goes into the debate about whether banks should have a bigger role in superannuation, as opposed to industry funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of industry funds in the superannuation industry must also be kept in perspective. Data from the ISC showed that total superannuation assets currently are around $190 billion and that industry funds have assets of around $9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude, in answer to this facetious question, by saying that yesterday we had Mr Howard saying that there is not much fat in the economy to cut out in terms of the budget because the fat that existed 10 to 15 years or so ago has gone. I remind the Senate: who was Treasurer 10 to 15 years ago&mdash;John Howard. Who cut it out? We did. That is why there is not much fat now. Yet at the same time, in contradistinction to his leader, we have Mr Costello running around Australia making flagrant promises of new expenditure while opposing over the last four years $11 billion-plus in terms of budget income. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am very pleased to be able to tell the Senate about a very interesting and very timely piece of research coming out of the University of York in the United Kingdom which is very good news for this government's policies and programs for families. The findings, written in particular by Dr Peter Whiteford, are reported in the latest issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Security Journal</EMPHASIS>, published by the Department of Social Security. If anyone wants to skim over what this report is about, then they can read Ross Gittins's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Saturday. He has actually had a very close look at it and he concludes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And our system does more to direct assistance to low-income families than any other system examined.</PARA>
<PARA>The other systems examined included studies of Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States, Norway, Sweden and the 12 countries of the European Union. Unlike a lot of other studies that we have seen recently, this study included a whole variety of benefits, including all cash payments, tax allowances for children, assistance with housing costs, assistance with child-care costs and the impact of the spending on health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study shows that the package of cash benefits for low income families in Australia was 47 per cent above the average for those 18 countries. It also found that low income working families in Australia pay the lowest level of direct taxes&mdash;that is, income taxes and social security contributions&mdash;of any of those countries. So it is very encouraging and a very big tick in favour of this government's policies of targeting and directing its payments and its assistance to those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a comparison of tax burdens, a family with two children earning half average weekly earnings and paying only four per cent of their income in tax in 1992 paid about half the level of taxes of a similar family in the United States, one-third the level of Japan or the United Kingdom, one-fifth the level of New Zealand, France or Germany and less than one-seventh of the level in Denmark and the Netherlands. It is a very important and useful article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article by Ross Gittins goes on to point out that it should be a very big challenge&mdash;he does not say this, but I do, concluding from what he says&mdash;for the opposition's policies. It is a very big challenge because in the Lyons Forum document there are recommendations for how it would be best to proceed on behalf of the opposition in terms of family policies, including a case made for the French quotient system. This article points out that that is a sleight of hand and the opposition seems to have bought it&mdash;that is, because the taxes are low, the social security payments are&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, this is exactly what is so good about this article, Senator Abetz. You should go and read the article because it allows you to conclude that although French families on average earnings pay no income tax, they do have to pay hefty social security contributions. Were we to introduce a quotient system, the loss of income tax revenue would be so great that we would have to introduce a GST to pay for it. In other words, the overall impact would be purely cosmetic. The article goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That does not make sense to Ross Gittins, and does not make sense to the government, but it does apparently make sense to the opposition&mdash;to redistribute away from the low income targeted payments this government has along with income splitting proposals. Senator Hill knows that those opposite are looking at income splitting and also the French alternative under the Lyons Forum.

How can the ALP support a campaign of industrial relations disruption at great cost to innocent parties as justified for political gain? Doesn't a campaign of fear and loathing to frighten voters debase Australian politics?

It is perfectly understandable that trade unions, feeling themselves to be potentially under siege by Tory governments both at home in South Australia and potentially here&mdash;although God knows why they should assume there is any prospect of that nationally&mdash;would want to act to preserve their position, just as the ACTU did and the relevant unions in the mining industry in Queensland have wanted to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, the government has always put on record that it believes unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, in Australia is unacceptably high. However, we want to put down some of the remarks made around the place, particularly by members opposite, about the level of youth unemployment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full-time teenage unemployment rate being 29 per cent does not mean that 29 per cent of Australian teenagers are unemployed. That is because only 25 per cent of teenagers were available for full-time work in October. Fifty-five per cent were in school and 13 per cent were in full-time post-school education. What we should focus on is the 95,600 teenagers looking for full-time work, which is 7.3 per cent of the teenage population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that we have in government reduced this number from John Howard's 158,000 in 1983, which amounted to over 12 per cent of the total teenage population being unemployed. I think it is time that the public understood that there is quite a difference, and understood the way the opposition has been making misleading comments on unemployment. Through our Working Nation policies, the number of long-term unemployed young people fell by 10 per cent over the year to October 1995. However, we do want to bring that number down even further, and that is the thrust of the Working Nation initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week Minister Crean released the results of discussions around the country with 700 young people about employment and labour market programs. These consultations showed that young people want more traineeships in growth areas, more options for vocational education and training at schools and better service from the CES. The minister has indicated that he is looking at all of these things to improve further how we can address these issues raised by young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Crean has already expressed a willingness to encourage the use of schools more effectively to provide pathways to work. We are expanding the options for years 11 and 12 students to pursue more vocational streams of education. We are increasing the opportunities for school leavers to go to university or TAFE or have structured training in a job. Last financial year 69,500 trainees and apprentices commenced work&mdash;nearly five per cent more than in 1993-94. Since Labor took office school retention rates have been increased from 40 per cent to 75 per cent, and university places have been increased by 64 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point we make is that we have not heard once from the opposition, though they are greatly critical of Working Nation, what they would replace it with and what they would do to create youth employment.

If you look at all of far East Gippsland and plot the remaining rainforest, most of it is outside the reserves. If you then plot on top of that the endangered species habitat and line up the coupes scheduled for logging this year, you will find that they all correspond. In other words, are you aware that the Victorian government has scheduled many areas of very high conservation value for logging this year? Finally, will the federal government prevent the clearfelling and woodchipping of any more rainforest in East Gippsland?</PARA></TALK.START>

Minister, how do you respond to the comments made by General John Grey, your former army chief, who has said that Australia could not defend itself against a prolonged attack because of funding shortfalls and warped priorities? In that it is not only our army that is having trouble, what priority are you giving to resolving the crisis in the air force over the loss of its air traffic controllers? What are you going to do to stop the continuing haemorrhage of experienced air traffic controllers from the RAAF? Will you be asking the Singaporean air force to bring its own air traffic controllers to RAAF Pearce so that Australia can keep its air force in the air?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of General Grey, you cannot please all the ex-generals all the time. In regard to air traffic controllers, the greatest thing that is going to affect the air force's air traffic controllers is a requirement by CASA for 400 new air traffic controllers by 1998. The differential in salary between the air force and this body after they have been through their ab initio training is between $7,000 and $20,000 a year. Therefore there is nothing we can do, in a legal sense, to prevent people transferring from the air force to CASA. However, I have had extensive discussions with both the Minister for Transport and the executive head of this particular body to see if we can cooperate in such a way that those sorts of deficiencies that will be caused by that recruiting will not harm the air force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first way we responded was to increase the number of basic recruits coming into the system. By next year we will be taking in something like 48 recruits a year, which is quite up on what was done in the past. It would be cost ineffective if we just did that and lost them. The second thing we talked to CASA about is that, even if they recruit them, they return those people to cover the areas they are currently servicing until the need arises in 1998 for them actually to go to that body. That will do a lot to relieve the strain. It is interesting that you asked whether Singapore would bring its air traffic controllers. They are having the same retention problems as the Australian Air Force&mdash;the same difficulties, if not more exacerbated than we have here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the particular problem, because you raised a specific problem, is cooperation between the air force and CASA to make sure they have the planned needs of all round Australia. There is no advantage to CASA in the long run in taking away air force traffic controllers who control skies around Townsville, sector 8 around Sydney and whatever around Darwin because, if we cannot supply air traffic controllers, they will need to do that themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point that we are looking at&mdash;we have not ruled out a retention bonus even though, as a principle, I prefer not to get into that area; I do not think it has ever been wildly successful in the past&mdash;is to restructure the career paths that people take. That may well have three streams over the future. The first is uniformed, across to civilian but staying within the air force, which would give more stability as a posting. That is, starting in uniform but eventually going to serve the air force under civilian conditions. The second stream may well be to go into the air force and eventually go into the CASA operation. The third stream will be those who want to stay in uniform all the way through their careers and provide the future leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of specialist areas will present a challenge to Defence as long as we remain one of the great training institutions in this country. Some of the other institutions in this country will have to learn to do more of the training themselves than they have in the past rather than trying to poach off the air force or some other military unit.</PARA>

I refer to the announcement yesterday of the Prime Minister's initiative for a nuclear weapons free world. Whilst I welcome Mr Keating's apparent conversion to the peace cause, I ask: do the comments in relation to the cessation of the production of fissile material outlined in yesterday's media package indicate that the government is prepared to reconsider its position in relation to uranium exports? Does the minister agree that the quid pro quo in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty with respect to the provision of uranium and nuclear technology to NPT signatories actually provides for the potential for a non-weapons state to quickly move to nuclear weapons capability and that this reality will require the Canberra Commission to totally reassess the effectiveness of the NPT as a vehicle for the elimination of nuclear weapons?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Margetts supports the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. We even had a grudging acknowledgment of its utility from Alexander Downer, which is a world first, and I thank him for that. I thank Senator Margetts for her support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is potentially one of the most important initiatives that Australia has ever taken in the sense that, if we can craft an agenda for the step-by-step reduction of nuclear weapons&mdash;presently, there are 50,000 warheads at large in the world&mdash;maintaining security as we go and creating a situation ultimately of zero, and hopefully sooner rather than later, then we will have made a massive contribution to making this world a safer and saner place. I believe that that objective is not only desirable but attainable. I hope very much, and I expect, that this commission, comprising an array of extraordinarily highly qualified people, will make a major contribution to setting that agenda moving forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the implications of all of this for the production of fissile material and other matters, including the export of uranium, certainly one of the things that it is hoped the commission will consider is the virtues of a convention for the cut-off on the production of fissile material, thus ensuring that no further such material is produced in the future. That should not be too hard a convention to actually negotiate&mdash;and preliminary steps are being taken toward that at the moment&mdash;because the truth of the matter is that none of the existing declared nuclear weapon states, including France, are presently engaged in the production of fissile material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That consideration ought to put at rest a concern that was expressed again, I think, last week by a number of members and senators about the possibility of Australia's&mdash;or anyone else's, for that matter&mdash;uranium notwithstanding the safeguards system, ending up in the production of military fissile material. The truth of the matter is that there are no grounds for concern about that because existing stockpiles, unhappily, are so extensive that, as far as I know&mdash;and certainly this is true for France because it has been publicly confirmed&mdash;no such material is being produced nor has it been since 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, under those circumstances, there does not seem to be any case at all for concern about the way in which the IAEA safeguards system is working under the existing nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The NPT, whichever way you look at it, will go on being an absolutely crucial element in the total equation if we are ever to achieve a nuclear weapons free world, as I certainly hope we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that there is somehow something not very helpful about the NPT, which seems to run through a lot of questions that come out of the Greens and others in the community, really does quite fundamentally miss the point. As I have said on many previous occasions, without it I think we would have been looking at a world with 25 or 30 nuclear weapons possessors at the moment rather than the five declared states that we have at the moment plus, of course, a small number of threshold or twilight zone states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As unsatisfactory as the present situation may be from a number of different points of view&mdash;and I do not think anyone could be totally comfortable with all aspects of it, in particular the attitude of some of the nuclear weapons powers&mdash;nonetheless, it is far and away the best system that we have. It was crucially important that the NPT be extended indefinitely, as it was in April, and that is one of the foundation stones on which, undoubtedly, the Canberra Commission will be building as it erects its plan for achieving a nuclear free world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to the City Link tollway project backed by the Kennett Victorian government. I ask: Minister, do you agree that a project with significant environmental consequences and which will attract up to $600 million in federal government tax concessions should be the subject of an environmental impact statement under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974? Has the Treasurer or the Development Allowance Authority approached your department to request that an environmental impact statement on the project be prepared under that act? As the minister responsible for that act, will you be insisting that a proper assessment is done before any federal government money is sunk into this project&mdash;a project which the Victorian government has exempted from much of its own environmental protection and town planning requirements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In July 1994, the Victorian government announced details about the Melbourne City Link proposal. At that stage the project included the construction of a southern bypass connecting the Westgate freeway to the south eastern arterial and a western bypass connecting the Tullamarine freeway to the Westgate freeway. The state government later decided to upgrade and widen the Tullamarine freeway between Flemington Road and Bulla Road as part of the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act has not been triggered in relation to the Tullamarine freeway project. I understand that legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the Development Allowance Authority is that the EPIP Act does not apply to decisions by the authority in relation to the granting of infrastructure bonds or to development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that a Commonwealth decision or action is required that is in fact subject to the act, the action minister must decide whether a proposal is likely to be environmentally significant and, if so, to refer it to the Environment Protection Agency. The Environment Protection Agency would then provide advice to me so that I could make a decision about the level of environmental assessment that was warranted if in fact environmental assessment was warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any such determination would take account of the potential environmental impacts and the adequacy of any state assessment processes that had been undertaken. At this stage of course I cannot speculate on Commonwealth environmental assessment requirements because of the situation that I have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general principle that you raise is an important one. I think you have seen a very strong commitment on the part of this government and me, as the environment minister, to ensure that proposals or developments that are environmentally significant are subject to the appropriate level of environmental assessment. That is a position I will not be resiling from, nor will the government. The situation in relation to the triggering of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is as I have outlined. It is a matter that is absolutely appropriate for the Victorian government to progress to full and thorough assessment of the environmental implications of the project.</PARA>

I refer to the government's latest cruel hoax&mdash;a report to be released by the employment minister suggesting that the government's five per cent unemployment target by the year 2000 will require economic growth of 3.5 per cent a year throughout the decade of the 1990s. Given that this government has only managed to average about 2.5 per cent a year economic growth over the first half of the decade and that you are busy slowing the economy down, isn't it simply preposterous to suggest the government has a snowflake's hope in hell of achieving the necessary 4.5 per cent a year average growth over the second half of this decade?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a snowflake in hell, we are not doing a real bad job, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> this week, where Australia was forecast to be the fastest growing economy of the major 15 OECD countries in 1996. That, of course, would be a continuation of the record that we have been able to achieve so far. Employment will continue to grow during the rest of 1995 and 1996 and thereafter because the outlook for economic growth remains very robust indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the recent levelling off in employment as only a temporary pause, reflecting a lag response, as Senator Cook has already said today, in the labour market to the slowing in economic growth to a more sustainable rate since late 1994. We are not trying to slow the economy down any further than we did. We did, of course, take the view it was unsustainable at six per cent plus. That view, I think, was universally shared. It had to come back to about the 3 1/2 to four per cent range. That is where we hope to have it and to keep it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment growth in 1995-96 is still expected to be broadly in line with the budget forecast of three per cent, with the unemployment rate being expected to fall throughout the rest of 1995-96. The job vacancy rate still remains at a high level by historic standards. That is a key indicator of continuing employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got, in accord VIII, a specific union commitment on employment growth. Under the new accord the government and the ACTU are committed to creating in excess of 600,000 jobs by March 1999. We have a strong endorsement for the Working Nation objective from the accord. Throughout the last period, and particularly since the last election, the track record of this government has been extraordinarily strong on employment. We fully expect that process to continue in the future and the unemployment figures to come out in the way we have forecast as being perfectly possible.</PARA>

I refer him to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, which last week showed, in a survey done by Access Economics, that out of all the OECD nations, only two had unemployment that was actually rising. Bearing in mind that Australia's teen jobless rate is 29 per cent, which is much higher than it was when the Working Nation policies were first introduced, I ask the minister: don't all of these indicators simply prove beyond any doubt whatsoever that your government has no answers for Australia's employment woes or economic woes and that it really is time for a change of government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 November, Senator Campbell asked me as the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question without notice about the release of a prime ministerial youth statement on youth unemployment and youth suicide. I undertook to obtain an answer for Senator Campbell. I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer reads as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has a very strong commitment to the youth of Australia. Throughout the term of this Government we have given high priority to issues affecting young people and have put in place key initiatives in areas like education, training, employment, social justice and civics. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has recently completed Working Nation consultations with young people throughout Australia to determine their attitudes on a whole range of youth employment issues and we will pay close attention to the results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although I have given no undertaking to deliver a Youth Statement, the Government will continue to develop policies which address the needs and concerns of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of Senator Campbell's claim that youth unemployment is 29%, this is the rate for 15-19 year olds looking for full-time work (seasonally adjusted). The official unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds, as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is 19.6% (October 1995, original data). In May 1994, when the Government announced Working Nation, the full-time unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds was 32.6% (seasonally adjusted), while the unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds was 23.2% (original data).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to Senator Campbell's reference to the rate of youth suicide, the Government is committed to addressing this issue and has provided some $13m in the 1995-96 Budget for the Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy over four years. This is the first national response to this serious problem. Pilot projects have also been initiated, with the aim of reducing the rate of youth suicides. These target young people within the high risk category, and aim to make services more responsive to the needs of young people in social and emotional crisis. Best practice in youth suicide prevention is also being merged into mainstream health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we should not exaggerate the problem. Figures in the 1995 Department of Human Services and Health monograph Youth Suicide in Australia indicate that between 1979 and 1993 the male youth suicide rate has climbed by almost 50 per cent&mdash;not doubled as asserted by the Senator. The female youth suicide rate and the overall Australian rate for the same period has remained stable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After question time on 23 November Senators Harradine and Herron invited me to reconsider a ruling which I made during the course of question time to the effect that the use of the name of a senator or a member of the House of Representatives with the implication that a senator was a liar is contrary to standing order 193. I have reconsidered my ruling and I believe that I was correct to intervene in the way that I did. Standing order 193 prohibits offensive words, imputations of improper motives and personal reflections in relation to senators, members of other houses and certain other office holders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predecessors have consistently ruled that it is contrary to standing order 193 to make any suggestion that a senator has lied&mdash;that is, deliberately and knowingly made untrue statements. Past Presidents' rulings have pointed out that it is not out of order to state that a senator's statements are untrue or misleading. The offence is constituted not by contradiction of another senator's statement, but the implication that a senator has deliberately or knowingly made untrue statements. As one of my predecessors ruled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is for the chair to judge whether this implication is present in any particular instance.</PARA>
<PARA>Past rulings have pointed out that expressions which may otherwise be acceptable are disorderly when, in their context, they carry the offensive implication that a senator has lied. The rulings to which I have referred are listed at page 232 of the printed version of Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, the 7th edition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During question time on 23 November, Senator Ian Macdonald interjected to Senator Cook: `You will just do a Carmen on it'. It was clear from the context of this remark that the senator was using the name of a member as a substitute for a direct accusation that Senator Cook would deliberately make false statements. Subsequently, I required Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins to withdraw expressions in which they sought to use the name of Senator Ian Macdonald in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that the offence against standing order 193 that was contained in these expressions was the implication that senators told lies. Where that implication is present, the expression is disorderly regardless of what substitute words are used. Senators have often used substitute expressions to try to get around the prohibition on accusations of lying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the chair must intervene when this device is used because otherwise the prohibition could be more or less openly flouted. In order to uphold the standing orders and the standard of debate, I will continue to intervene when it is clear that a substitute expression is being used to subvert the prohibition and to make the forbidden implication that senators are lying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of question time, Senator Ian Macdonald referred to an answer to a question by Senator Gareth Evans as `coming from the leader of the party that is seen as the greatest mob of liars in history'. As that remark clearly implied that Senator Evans and his colleagues in the Senate are liars, I required Senator Macdonald to withdraw the remark. In the noise which followed, interjections by Senator Macdonald and others, most of which are not recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, persuaded me that Senator Macdonald had not said what in fact he had said and is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I therefore did not persist with the requirement for a withdrawal. Senator Macdonald's expression, however, was clearly disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rulings of my predecessors have made it quite clear that words which are offensive when used against a particular senator are equally as offensive, if not more offensive, when used against a group of senators. Again, the past rulings are recorded at page 232 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Odgers</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding this statement, I observe that the Senate has been extremely unruly during question time in recent weeks, and it has not been possible for the chair, in the general disorder, to censure every disorderly expression. I simply say to senators, as I have said on previous occasions, that the recent behaviour of some of them during question time is bringing both those senators and the institution into disrepute. I again appeal for appropriate standards of debate and conduct to be restored to our proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few senators have not complained at some time about the low standing in which MPs and senators are held by the public, yet in the one hour of question time each day the activities of a few senators&mdash;and I mean only a few&mdash;does more to diminish that standing than most other activities at other times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish in part to ask you a question and I also in part wish to make an observation. My understanding is that your ruling was not based on a particular name or an inference that that particular person has a reputation for telling untruths. It is a set of words used in the context of challenging somebody else's veracity that leads you to the conclusion that they are implying that the name used is the substitution for telling the truth or claiming an untruth. For instance, it is not a question of somebody having a reputation for telling untruths. There are people in the chamber, in my view, who do not have a reputation for telling untruths but deserve one. It might well be that the name `Carmen' could be substituted for `Sue'. But I take it that you are saying that no name is quarantined from your ruling. You are simply saying that if a name in the context is put in such a way as to draw the conclusion in the mind of a reasonable person that the inference is that a lie is to be told, that is to be ruled out of order.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I agree with the general thrust of your ruling as to the general implication, as soon as you make that ruling, you and all the other people that occupy the chair in this chamber will have to exercise their mind on every single occasion as to whether or not the name `Carmen Lawrence' is unparliamentary in that particular circumstance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to say that the use of `Carmen Lawrence' as an interjection is disorderly. It has to be in context. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) this day, relating to industrial relations in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The substance of that question was to get a response from the government with regard to the fear and loathing campaign which is outlined in a document, which fell off the back of a truck last week, from the South Australian United Trades and Labour Council. What has just occurred in this place highlights the types of tactics being used now in the parliamentary scene that are emanating from the Labor Party which create a situation whereby there is a reaction from this side of politics to the dishonesty that is being perpetrated in politics today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We read through this particular document and we find such comments as, `There are a range of specific federal campaigns which unions, the ACTU, the UTLC are involved in.' They mention Western Australia, CRA and others. Going further into this particular document we find that it also makes reference to running a `fear and loathing campaign on individual contracts. That we must define the scope of the message very clearly and stick to it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has nothing to do with the merit of the case that the Labor Party might have to run or the merit of the case that we might have to run; it is to totally run a deliberately dishonest campaign with regard to what exists. We look further into the document and find that it says that the initial idea is to play on the mood of `tide of change' and `uncertain et cetera'. It says, `Hidden cameras in boss's office has boss threatening workers with new contracts or else; details of contract are out of focus.' That is what is in this particular document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes one wonder about the answer from Senator Gareth Evans to my question last week. He said that the problem with CRA was that they offer too large a carrot. His exact words were, `Initially through the offering of large sized carrots.' That is what the minister said last week. On that occasion Senator Evans was absolutely accurate. But we are being confronted with this fear and loathing campaign which is based on the total misrepresentation of what the truths are and what the fact of a particular matter is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite shameful what the South Australian Trades and Labour Council is doing, or what the Western Australian Labour Council is doing or the backing that is coming from this particular government in terms of that campaign. It is time they came clean on their particular campaigns&mdash;more honest about what the situations were and not have this fear and loathing campaign which exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope some of them had a look yesterday at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and the interviews that were done up at Hamersley, a subsidiary of CRA. I want to quote what people said; they are not their exact words. They spoke to a contract worker. What did he say? He said, `No longer do we leave our brains on the gate post as we go to work.' They spoke to a unionist. He said, `It has been good for us. No strikes, record free injury time and more money.' That was from a unionist who said, `We do not want to go onto the contract, but we work here and it is good for us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we work through this whole process of what is happening in this campaign&mdash;first of all in Western Australia&mdash;we see in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> that the coal strikers reached 105 days at Vickery. One has to put to the government: how many times has the AIRC ordered them back to work? As Senator Evans, sitting across there, knows, on a significant number of times. But the government has been absolutely quiet. There has not been a squeak out of them in terms of saying, `Hey, boys, it's about time you obeyed the rules of the particular umpire.' So I am bringing this point to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I think this is probably the lowest the Labor Party, in conjunction with the union movement, has stooped in terms of dealing with a particular political situation.

There is an Italian in Perth who is a member of the Western Australian parliament and a minister. There are others around the country who, I believe, have also contributed to the nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fourth generation Germans might have half the influence the Italians have. The point is this: Senator Evans was asked why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not called for the disendorsement of Mr Campbell as the Labor candidate for the next election. I am sure that the Prime Minister will not call for Mr Campbell's disendorsement because he knows that Mr Campbell would probably still win as an Independent. There would be a greater chance for the Liberal Party should Mr Campbell be disendorsed, but he would have a fair chance of being re-elected as an Independent and the Prime Minister would not take that chance.</PARA></TALK.START>

I could be wrong in saying what I am about to say but I wonder if the government is not happy to have Mr Campbell letting the media call him irrelevant or whatever else they like to think about him. I do not think that he is irrelevant in Kalgoorlie, I am afraid to say. I live in the electorate of Kalgoorlie and I do not think that Mr Campbell is irrelevant there. But I am wondering whether the government is not happy to have Mr Campbell there to canvas these issues. If there were some Australians who think that Labor's immigration policy is not what they want, they would see Mr Campbell as their saviour.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our current taxation system is one which is based on the income of the individual, and it does not recognise the differences in individuals' capacities to pay tax. For example, a single person with no dependants, earning $30,000 p.a. pays the same amount of tax as a married person who is the sole breadwinner for a family with two children who earns $30,000 p.a. This system is of clear disadvantage to the person who is married with two children, as that person has three dependants, compared with the individual who supports only her/himself. The married person with the children has a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">different capacity to pay tax</EMPHASIS>, which the individual-based taxation system fails to recognise.</PARA>
<PARA>The report then, in dealing with that problem, outlines some proposals. One which was put before the Lyons Forum was the French quotient system. Nowhere in the report does the Lyons Forum adopt the French quotient system. I must say from reading it, it sounds a very nice and fair system. But, given our current economic structure and taxation burden, I doubt that we could implement that system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has to be recognised is that at least the Lyons Forum has acknowledged the very real disadvantage of single-income families where the need of children and spouse are required to be met, something that Senator Crowley never seems to accept. This government after 13 years in office has not addressed those very real problems that are hurting the battlers within the community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Campbell this day, relating to youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>I am incredulous at the response not only to my question today from Senator Gareth Evans, representing the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this place, but also to the answer he provided to a question on 22 November 1995 where I also asked him about youth unemployment and youth suicide and this government's not just lack of attention but lack of action on these matters. Senator Evans said in this chamber on 22 November that he did not have any information on that and he would get me an instant answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put that in context. Whenever you ask this government about youth issues and whenever they make a statement about youth issues publicly, they say these are a matter of incredible moment for the government. They are giving the highest level of consideration to these matters. When the Prime Minister's representative in the Senate is asked a question about youth unemployment or youth suicide, he is unable to answer. He does not have a brief. I put it to you that that is an incredible indictment upon this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an enormously high rate of youth unemployment&mdash;29 per cent. You find that, when Senator Schacht answered a question on this matter today&mdash;virtually word for word giving the information that Senator Evans has given to me in his subsequent answer&mdash;he went through the statistical reasons why it is 29 per cent and almost said that it is not a bad thing. He did not say that, but I will quote what Senator Evans said in answer to my question. If you check it against the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, you will find it is virtually verbatim from the brief Senator Schacht was reading from during question time today. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of Senator Campbell's claim that youth unemployment is 29%, this is the rate for 15-19 year olds looking for full-time work (seasonally adjusted).</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the youth unemployment rate is. I continue to quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The official unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds, as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is 19.6% (October 1995, original data). In May 1994, when the Government announced Working Nation, the full-time unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds was 32.6% (seasonally adjusted), while the unemployment rate for 15-19 year olds was 23.2% (original data).</PARA>
<PARA>I read that statement particularly for the benefit of younger people who are listening to this debate at the moment. What does that mean to you? I bet most of them have no contemplation. The reality is that Australia has a youth unemployment crisis, yet this government contents itself to say, `Look, we've got Working Nation. We're very concerned about it.' But the reality is very different. The youth unemployment rate is going up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now look at general unemployment. I was reading a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> article on Thursday night on the aeroplane&mdash;and this relates to the question I asked today&mdash;and saw that they did an analysis of all of the unemployment rates in most of the Western nations, the OECD nations. Only two nations had unemployment rates that were going up&mdash;Australia and Germany. Every other nation in the Western world has unemployment going down. We have got it going up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was trying to get to in my question to the Leader of the Government, who clearly did not want to answer the question, is how are we going to achieve a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000 unless there is a change of policies or unless there is a change of government? He did not indicate any policy changes, he just said, `We will go along the way we are going. We will have high interest rates and high inflation, but somehow, miraculously, we will have this reduction in unemployment from close to nine per cent down to five per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most remarkable thing that has happened today is in this report that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, has brought out. They are now predicting that unemployment in the year 2005 will be four per cent. So, just as unemployment starts going up, they have said, `Yes, we will still achieve five per cent in the year 2000 even though growth has gone down. But don't worry, in the year 2005, it will be even better. It will only be four per cent.' I put it to the minister, the next time unemployment goes up, he is likely to say, `In the year 2010 it will only be three per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you what, by the time we get to the year 2020 it is going to be nirvana. You kids in the gallery, look forward to the year 2020, because there will be negative two per cent unemployment on the way this government is going, on its reports and on what it says to the people, `We are really looking good on unemployment. Even though it is going up at the moment, even though the trend for the Labor government is increasing levels of unemployment, don't worry, in the year 2010, she'll be right.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to abuse the agreement that the Senate has granted me to introduce this bill, but I would just make a brief statement, before seeking to incorporate the full speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This bill follows on the extensive work of the conservation movement in preparing the necessary criteria to protect forests of high conservation value. The government has overwhelming public support to act to save the forests. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has the necessary constitutional power to protect our forests&mdash;and the only impediment is political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill sets out to amend the Export Control Act in such a way that would phase out the export of woodchips from native forests, prohibit logging in definite categories of native forests on public land immediately, prohibit the export of woodchips from defined categories of native forests immediately, and implement a transitional strategy for the wood products industry. This bill is step 1 in a positive, pro-active holistic strategy to save our wonderful, precious native forests. The onus is now on the government to act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a bill for the future; the future of our native forests, the future of workers in the industry and the future of all our children. This bill gives a voice to people in the community who want to see a clear show of political will on the part of the government to end the destruction of our native forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Forest Protection Bill seeks to provide immediate protection for high conservation value forests from logging. It legislates for a phase out of export woodchipping in native forests by 1998. It also provides for an industry transition strategy, to protect workers and secure their future through a transition to the extensive plantation base within Australia currently available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives a voice to a section of the community which has been demanding action from the government. The major impetus for the bill came from the Australian Greens in consultation with the environment movement and all involved deserve acknowledgment for their tremendous work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens (WA) are committed to an holistic approach to protecting our magnificent forests. We recognise that there are many other issues to be addressed such as Aboriginal land rights, environmentally sensitive plantations, mining, minimal impact use and ecologically sensitive tourism. Obviously a purely legislative approach on its own cannot protect Australia's forests, but it is an important piece in the jigsaw. We hope that this bill is the start of an holistic approach, not the end point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will not satisfy everyone. The forests debate in this country is a complex and evolving one. However, this bill will play an important political role at this critical time for our forests. We also hope that in the future we can expand its application, incorporating concerns and suggestions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens have been asked to introduce because the government hasn't.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill represents commitments given within Labor Party and government policy. I challenge the government to deny that they are committed to protecting high conservation value forests, to phasing out export woodchipping and to providing a future for forest industry workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has a very narrow focus, with a very specific aim. It is being introduced in the lead up to the announcement on the Deferred Forest Assessment process and the consideration of export woodchip licences. The bill forms a benchmark by which to judge the commitment of the government and the Coalition to forests. I call on all parliamentarians and political parties to make their position clear on this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a community we stand at the edge of a solution to the forest debate. We have all the pieces of the jigsaw.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native forests are cherished by the Australian community. We have learnt from indigenous Australians that forests have many values; biological, cultural and spiritual and that we must honour these values. We understand the scientific values of the plants and animals that make up our native forests. We recognise that the native forests based industry is in decline and in the process is hurting workers and their families. We know that it is woodchipping, not the smaller sawn timber sector, which is driving the destruction of our forests, for negligible economic gain to Australia. We know there are alternatives. We can start with a timber industry based on our rich plantation resource, with down stream processing using clean technology. There must be recognition of the social and economic benefits of the non-timber values of forests, such as habitat for plants and animals, water quality, recreation, research and tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These aspects are the pieces of the jigsaw, which joined together offer an holistic solution to the forests debate; conservation of our natural and cultural heritage, protection of workers and their families and a viable, value adding plantation based industry of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic failure of the industry is now well documented. The industry is a job shedding one, not job creating. Employment in the industry has fallen from around 55 000 in the early 1970s to approximately 32 000 at present. There is nothing to suggest that this decline will not continue. The concentration of industry ownership, substitution from plantations and mechanisation have been the primary causes of these job losses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net economic benefit to the country is further curtailed by the involvement of foreign owned corporations in the industry. The lack of down stream processing and export of woodchips for processing overseas further strips Australia economic benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to job losses and profit leaching for the domestic economy the public purse continues to subsidise native forests logging operations. Infrastructure, such as roading is provided and excessively low royalties are charged. The Federal Resource Assessment Commission in its Forest and Timber Inquiry Report found that expenditure had outweighed revenue since at least the 1920s. in every state forest service, except South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why do we continue to publicly support an uncompetitive, job shedding, non-value adding, largely foreign owned industry?  It seems inexplicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the native forest based industry is our history, plantations offer a future. This is something that both the plantation based timber sector and the environment movement have been saying for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued reliance on a native forest resource base flies in the face of worldwide industry trends. Other countries have invested heavily in plantations. Plantations in Chile, Brazil and the Pacific rim are already becoming the preferred resource for international buyers. Their extensive plantation resources and lower labour costs have the potential to undermine Australia's domestic plantation industry. Australian governments must  affirm the importance of plantations to the future of the industry as a whole and actively support their development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has an abundant plantation based timber resources which can supply Australia's needs. A report by the resource economist, Dr Judy Clark, entitled "Softwood Plantation Sawlog Stockpile", details this. I quote</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia has approximately 88 000 hectares of softwood plantations past their harvest age of 30 years. These plantations contain an estimated 24 million m3 stockpile of sawlogs. This is six times the annual native forest cut five times the annual plantation sawlog cut.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For plantation owners, predominantly State governments, this stockpile holds unrealised revenues of up to $830 million. Processing the sawlog stockpile would generate an estimated $3 billion in sawn timber sales by Australian industry."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fate of timber industry workers and their families is a vital concern in this debate. The wood products industry, industry bodies and foreign corporations have used timber workers as pawns. This is unacceptable. Protection of our forests and protection of timber workers are inextricable linked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the future of the industry and workers is in plantations. However, it would be simplistic to pretend that all workers can seamlessly move from one job to another or from one place to another. The complete mobility of skills and labour is another economic rationalist myth. That is why a extensive transition strategy is vital. I acknowledge that the government has begun to look at this issue through the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy. However, a strategy must be established speedily, in close consultation with affected local communities and with a meaningful degree of assistance, not a token one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the heart of this debate, for me, is that forests are inseparable from our own humanity. Their cultural, spiritual and recreational values are enormous. I would like to quote from the statement on forests by the New South Wales Ecumenical Council, The Uniting Church of Australia, The Sydney Anglican Social Issues Committee and The Catholic Church.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is a spiritual dimension to the forests, as well as a biological, social and economic one. The political agenda must take this spirituality on board: we must value God's creation appropriately. Forests are a vital part of this creation and of its ongoing sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inter relatedness of healthy forests and life&mdash;including human life&mdash;on this planet is testimony to the fact that forests are more than gifts from God for human beings to exploit. Our God-given human calling is to work responsibly with the rest of creation for human well being. But human well being in the long term is integrally related to the correct, sustainable use of God given forest resources."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the community wants to preserve Australia's native forests for their many values. It is clear that we can supply our wood requirements from plantations. It is clear that we must also address the needs of workers in the native forest based industry and assist their adjustment to an ecologically sustainable approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So why is the government failing to protect native forests and why is the Opposition, by it silence, consenting to this act of environmental vandalism. Every day that native forests continue to be logged and woodchipped, the government is responsible for bringing endangered species closer to extinction. It is responsible for deliberately authorising the destruction of thousands of hectares of rainforest, old growth forest and wilderness. It is responsible for the wanton destruction of world heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commonwealth has the powers, and indeed the responsibility, to bring these pieces together. This bill clearly shows where the commonwealth's power lies. Protection of high conservation value forests is an implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity, signed using the external affairs power. Protecting these areas from the actions of domestic and foreign corporations is covered by the corporations power. The commonwealth's ability to phase out export woodchipping is unchallenged. This is a clear use of power which the commonwealth exercises each year to renew export woodchip licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it remains the case that the government has the means but not the will. It has made commitments, but these have not been honoured. This bill is a benchmark. The major parties will be judged by the community on their response to it and the fundamental principles it embodies. Neither party can afford to fail this test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As representatives of your constituents, honourable Senators must each take personal responsibility for the fate of our forests. You must be prepared to explain your decision to your children and to your children's children. Will you support escalating the destruction of their inheritance?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In concluding I must come back to the very core of the issue and that is the inherent value of forests for forests sake. To deny their fundamental importance to the world in which we live is to deny our own humanity. I would like to finish with a quote from The Courier by Jacques Brosse.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All over the world, there lingers on the memory of a giant tree, the primal tree, rising from the centre of the Earth to the heavens and ordering the universe around it. It united the three worlds: its roots plunged down into subterranean abysses, its loftiest branches touched the empyrean. Thanks to the Tree, it became possible to breathe the air; to all the creatures that then appeared on earth it dispensed its fruit, ripened by the sun and nourished by the water which drew from soil. From the sky it attracted the lightening from which man made fire and, beckoning skyward, where clouds gathered around its crown, it bade the life-giving rains to fall.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to present this report to the Senate. It came about when on 10 November 1994 the Hon. Brian Howe MP, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development, invited the committee to inquire into and report on what is known as draft amendment No. 14 to the national capital plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seeks to expand the range of permitted land uses from the current `offensive and hazardous industries' to just the more general `industries'. Covering four sites identified as A, B, C and D, the area lies within broadacre areas of the national capital plan. It is bound by Oaks Estate, the ACT/New South Wales border, Canberra Avenue and the Molonglo River corridor. It in fact includes the sites currently occupied by the Canberra Abattoir and the Canberra Tannery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee conducted an on-site inspection of the area on 27 February 1995, took evidence from key interested parties at public hearings on 27 February and 6 March and written submissions were also received and considered by the committee. It all took somewhat longer than anticipated and, for the first time that I can recall, there is a dissenting report associated with this. The matter was debated at great length, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Colston, by the committee and a number of contentious issues were discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry highlighted some of the difficulties in looking at land use purposes operating under two planning regimes in the national capital. In the ACT, both Commonwealth and ACT legislation operates. There are two plans known as the national capital plan and the territory plan, which are the responsibility of the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority respectively. I guess it is inevitable that from time to time there will be differences in the plans and there will be issues that will need to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that just recently the chief minister of the ACT government and the minister, Mr Howe, established a committee to jointly look at aspects relating to planning. I have not seen the specific terms of reference but I think anyone who has been involved in this area would recognise the areas that would be looked at and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that the committee received this reference was that there was an anomaly between the national capital plan and the territory plan. The national capital plan only permitted `hazardous and offensive industries' on the sites while the territory plan permitted `industries' for all but one site within the draft amendment area. However, the territory plan has no effect if it is inconsistent with the national capital plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impetus for draft amendment No. 14 was an application by the proprietor of the Canberra Abattoir to vary its lease in that he wished to close the abattoir and seek to redevelop some of the land into an industrial estate, comprising I think some 50 blocks. Draft amendment No. 14 does not, in itself, result in an automatic change in land use on the abattoir site as there are mandatory processes also required by the ACT government before any change in land use or any development application can be approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment raised several important issues which are dealt with in the report, and the committee considered the extent of the area of the sites A, B, C and D. Some of the issues were the impact on nearby residents, the need for an adequate buffer zone to allow screening from any development in the area and Canberra Avenue, the concerns of the Queanbeyan City Council, and the need to reduce anomalies between the national capital plan and the territory plan. It led the committee to conclude that it was appropriate to vary the plan in relation to sites A, B and D but excluding site C. Consequently, the committee recommends that draft amendment No. 14, as originally proposed, be not agreed to but that the variation relate to sites A, B and D. Reasons for this are set out in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to thank the staff involved with this inquiry, which, as I said, took much longer than expected, in particular, Meg Crooks, the secretary to the committee, and all others who have worked with us. It is necessary also to comment a little on the arguments that took place and the reasons some members of the committee came to a different point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that what we have done enables a lessee to be innovative, to show initiative, to show some entrepreneurship in relation to their activities in the Australian Capital Territory. It is my view that the alternate proposal, which other members of the committee preferred, would in fact lead to a situation of stifling initiative, stifling entrepreneurship and discouraging business from being involved in the ACT. I believe any person has the right to consider redeveloping, reassess what they are doing and enter some other activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that a person who has a lease in Canberra, if they did not wish to proceed with what they were doing at the present time, should only be able to get rid of it by surrendering it I think would have quite a devastating effect on the morale of the business community and people generally in the Australian Capital Territory. There is no doubt that there is a betterment tax paid if you seek to change the purpose of the lease which you occupy and want to do something else. It will be assessed and taxed at an appropriate rate and that tax will be paid. I understand that that is also a matter being reviewed by the ACT government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to suggest that the only course this particular company could follow would be to give back the abattoir to the ACT government and hope to be recompensed for it and that any further development might be done by somebody else or by the ACT government is not the sort of society I would want to live in; it is not the message I would want to give to people here. I would hope that we would live in a society where people would be innovative and show entrepreneurship to develop and to create other jobs and other opportunities, rather than send a message that that is not the way we do things in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal will mean that a part of the land we looked at would be able to be redeveloped as an industry area, as opposed to its present definition of a hazardous industry area. It will remain to be determined, presumably by the ACT government in the future, what steps can be taken, if any, in relation to the rest of the site and what steps will be taken to meet some of the objectives which were also referred to in terms of the need for an adequate buffer zone and taking into account the area from the point of view of residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a difference of view on the committee as to how this should proceed. I have briefly outlined some of the points that we were considering in dealing with it. I recommend the report to the Senate, that amendment No. 14 be not proceeded with as put to us but be proceeded with in relation to those areas identified as A, B and D. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My only reason for speaking to this report of the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories is to outline that the so-called majority report was arrived at because of a farcical stacking of the committee, culminating in a vote in which some members who did not have involvement in the inquiry before the final vote was taken simply and blindly followed their colleagues' votes. That final vote, incidentally, could have taken place earlier but it was postponed when it became clear that the chair and the coalition did not have the numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Sharp MP, to my knowledge, had not attended one meeting of the committee during the 37th parliament, until he was corralled by his coalition colleagues to vote on the final draft. His total contribution to the committee in this parliament has therefore been about 10 minutes. I am not criticising Mr Sharp for his non-attendance. We all have competing demands on our time. Mr Sharp obviously concluded that this committee could work well without his assistance. For him to appear at one single meeting of the committee, however, to vote on a closely divided committee issue could be regarded as transparent opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alan Ferguson was appointed to the committee to replace Senator Noel Crichton-Browne on 23 October 1995. On the same day, Senator Ferguson voted on the report. I have no criticism of Senator Ferguson&mdash;he was apparently briefed by his coalition colleagues&mdash;but I do question the wisdom of voting on a proposal without hearing at least a majority of the evidence and attending the site inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My good friend and colleague the Hon. Leo McLeay was unable to attend most meetings of the committee for this reference because of his onerous duties as Chief Whip. He came to the meeting to support his colleague the chairman who, until Mr McLeay's arrival, was the only government member who supported what was to become the majority report. Thus, of the nine members who regularly attended the meetings and heard the evidence, five have signed what is a minority report. It was actually a majority of those who had a reasonable knowledge of what they were voting for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If committees are going to be run according to Tammany-Hall rules, they will bring the committee system of this parliament into disrepute. Given the time, effort and expense put into this inquiry I doubt that the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) can take much comfort from the fact that he asked the committee whether it wished to inquire into the proposed amendment to the National Capital Plan. I trust he will take into account the so-called minority report and the matters I have alluded to in my brief comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Colston for putting those points on the record with regard to the way in which the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories operated. I will not go over those same issues, except to say that I, too, was very disappointed about how the whole matter occurred and to emphasise that there are five members of the committee who have signed this dissenting report. As Senator Colston said, that is a clear majority of the committee members who participated in the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am still upset about the whole issue. It is not just a matter of a slight difference of opinion; it goes to the very basic issues that were concerned with this reference. I also urge the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) to take particular note of the alternative recommendations of the five committee members who signed the dissenting report. It is a brief dissent of only two pages but it sets out the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to correct something Senator Reid said. I think she said this was the first dissenting report of this committee. That is not so, because I put in a dissenting report in relation to the transport problems of Christmas, Cocos and Norfolk islands. I make that point to emphasise there is a difference between one member of a committee putting a point of view to indicate an ideological difference and such a significant number of committee members dissenting, as occurred in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to Senator Reid's point about entrepreneurship and people having the right to seek a change of use for their lease, we are not talking about a minor change of use. We are not talking about somebody having a lease over a normal block in Canberra and seeking to change it from a car yard to some other industry, or even a change from one residence to four. We are talking about changing a substantial area that was set up as an abattoir. Originally, it was a Commonwealth abattoir; it has been a private abattoir for some years. The proposal is to change it so that it is effectively a new industrial suburb of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point of view is that if that is to happen, it ought to be done by the proper planning processes. This proposal was not dealt with in the normal course of planning processes. It only arose because the current lessee, the Mulligan company, which runs the abattoir, wanted to close it down and concentrate its activities at another abattoir in Cowra. It sought to profit from the remainder of its lease term and any renewal by developing and subdividing the site as an industrial estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the planning issue, quite apart from the correctness of the process, it may be that there is a need for a new industrial suburb in Canberra. It may even be that this is the best place for it, although I have my doubts because of its closeness to the border and to Queanbeyan. But if this is to happen, it ought to happen by the normal processes of looking at the overall planning of Canberra and saying, `Fyshwick, Mitchell and so on don't have enough room and we need a new industrial suburb.' It should not be done in this ad hoc way. To illustrate the point, I will read part of the dissenting report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also accept that in such circumstances a lessee should be able to seek to have its lease terminated and that there is value to the lessee in the remainder of its lease term.</PARA>
<PARA>The company thought this was the only way that it could get value out of the remainder of its lease term. They were under a misapprehension about their entitlement for the lease to be terminated and for them to get compensation. That was not so. We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we believe that the fairest way in which the lessee's needs and rights should be satisfied, while ensuring that the community's rights are protected, is for the lease to be terminated and the lessee to be appropriately compensated for the value of the remainder of the term of the lease based on its current use.</PARA>
<PARA>We were not suggesting they should lose any remaining value they had in that lease. The dissenting report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While recognising that there would be risks in its proposed investment as a developer, and acknowledging that betterment would be payable to the ACT Government, there is no justification for the present lessee potentially to profit from such a substantial change of use, nor for it automatically to become the developer of what would be effectively a new industrial suburb without competing for that right.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is why I am a bit surprised at the opposition's attitude to this matter. I would have thought the fair way of ensuring that if there was to be this development it was done in a competitive way would be by calling for tenders and not just letting it be given to the lessee who happened to have had it for an entirely different reason. The dissenting report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, in the proper planning processes, it is determined that the area in question is the appropriate place for a new industrial suburb for the ACT, then that planning, subdivision and development should be by the ACT Government and not by a private developer, unless&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I acknowledge that this is an option&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government decided to contract out all or part of the process, and called tenders for this task in the proper way.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not what is being proposed. The dissenting report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision-making about whether there should be a new industrial suburb, whether it should be in this area or elsewhere in the ACT-Queanbeyan area, the size and nature of the industrial estate, its relationship to Queanbeyan and Oaks Estate, and other planning requirements, would thereby be fully in the community's hands and not those of a single private company which happened to hold a lease for a quite different purpose, and one which it no longer wished to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reiterate that the lessee should be treated fairly, and that it should not suffer a loss in respect of the properly assessed valve of the rest of its lease term.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we go on to make a recommendation which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the amendment as proposed not be approved, and that it not be approved in the suggested modified form.</PARA>
<PARA>We recommend further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the company be advised that, if it surrenders its lease or if the lease is compulsorily acquired, the company can be fairly compensated under ACT legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was something we found out late in the inquiry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the ACT Government be requested to consider all the issues raised in this Report, and in particular in this dissent, . . . and advise the Commonwealth of its preferred use . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that, if then necessary, the Minister could refer an appropriate amendment to the Committee for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that this is an issue of proper planning for the ACT and a question of proper process in terms of whether or not the existing lessee has the right to such a substantial change in the use of the land and the right to potentially profit from developing a new industrial suburb. I once again express my anger about the whole issue. If the majority report were to be adopted, I think it would be outrageous. I urge the minister to take particular note of the serious issues involved and to adopt the alternative recommendations of the five committee members who signed this dissenting report. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the Joint Committee's tasks since its formation in 1991 has been monitoring the investigation and prosecution of breaches of corporate law in the 1980's, with a particular concern about delay in resolving these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These events and the investigations resulting from them are now up to 8 years old, with a number still to be brought before the Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the decision of the Attorney-General pursuant to section 1316 of the Corporations Law to consent to the commencement of proceedings against Mr Bond, Mr Oates and Mr Mitchell in relation to a Bell Resources matter is a reminder that matters of great complexity requiring very considerable application of the resources of the Australian Securities Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts are still to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1993 the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Alan Cameron, commented publicly `that Section 1316 of the Corporations Law may impede the prosecution of corporate crime, particularly in complex cases.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised this issue with Mr Cameron when he appeared before a public hearing of the Committee in April 1994. Mr Cameron said</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty is that any such decision is itself capable of being reviewed. . . . The only thing that is certain is that an aggressive defendant's first ploy will be to tie us up, potentially for years, in administrative review of the Attorney-General's decision to extend the time. That is the reason we are not sure why there needs to be a special rule for corporate crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Options considered by the Committee in its inquiry included </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">repealing the present limitation period in relation to indictable offences</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increasing the limitation period from 5 years to 7 years, or retaining the Attorney-General's discretion, with the removal of any right of review of the exercise of the discretion, or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">no change</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence before the Committee focused on the distinction between indictable offences (subject to no general limitation period under the Crimes Act 1914) and summary offences (which are subject to a 12 months limitation period under the Crimes Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arguments favouring abolition of the Attorney-General's consent under section 1316 were</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) it will put corporate criminal prosecutions on the same basis as the general criminal law, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) it is not an appropriate role for the Attorney-General under the current independent prosecution processes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arguments advanced advocating retention of section 1316, stressed that the limitation period should apply to indictable offences under the Corporations Law as limitation periods in general act as a discipline on agencies to ensure expeditious investigatory and prosecuting processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that there should be no limitation period for serious or indictable offences under the Corporations Law, and that section 1316 of the Corporations Law should be amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of summary offences, the Committee decided that these offences should be subject to a limitation period of 5 years but without any capacity on the part of the Attorney-General to extend. The Committee found that the Crimes Act limitation period of 12 months would not allow proper investigation of summary offences under the Corporations Law, some of which involve quite serious breaches of corporate behaviour. I draw the attention of the House to the opinion tabled in respect of this matter by Senator Cooney.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central point in the submissions advocating retention of a limitation period and a discretion in the Attorney-General was that such a discretion provided enhanced accountability for the exercise of the already wide powers of the ASC and the DPP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary arguments to the Committee stressed two important remedies to this situation: judicial or administrative review of a prosecution decision; and, the courts limiting the commencement of prosecutions due to abuse of process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent decisions indicate that suspect proceedings will not easily escape the Courts' scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not agree that the addition of a discretion in the Attorney-General to allow an extended period for prosecution will enhance this protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concludes that the current discretion allowed to the Attorney-General does not significantly add to the proper and desirable level of protection of persons accused under various provisions of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well since the creation of the office of the DPP, a statutory independent prosecuting authority, it would be anomalous for the Attorney-General to retain an effective prosecutorial discretion such as that currently contained in section 1316. The Committee believes that corporate criminal law should be on the same basis as serious general criminal offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does, however, believe that the ASC and the DPP should include extra information in their annual reports to provide some better information on the DPP's decisions in relation to corporate offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that in future a clear picture be presented each year of the number of current matters in the hands of the DPP, the time that has elapsed since the alleged commission of offences that may be involved in each matter; and, the state each matter has reached in the investigation, assessment and prosecution process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that such a picture will allow the responsible Minister and the Parliament to better ensure that there is appropriate public information on the ASC and the DPPs administration of this area of their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has formally recommended in its report that future annual reports of the Australian Securities Commission and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions provide detailed information showing the time that has elapsed since the commission of alleged offences under the Corporations Law and the time that has elapsed since the commencement of active investigative and prosecutorial processes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to table this report on behalf of the chairman of the committee, Senator Chris Evans, who unfortunately is unable to be here because he is attending to a very important matter&mdash;an expected addition to his family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report relates to a delegation to New Zealand by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. The visit was conducted from 7 August to 10 August this year. The members who visited New Zealand were Senator Chris Evans, the chairman; Senator Chamarette; Mr Harry Quick; the committee secretary, Peter Grundy; and me. At the outset, I wish to place on record the committee's thanks to Mr Peter Grundy for his excellent work and the valuable assistance he rendered to committee members during the course of the visit. The committee worked very well together and in fact enjoyed each other's contributions to the subject in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit occurred at the invitation of the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, the Hon. Mr Peter Tapsell, and it took place under the committee exchange program which exists between the two countries. This program involves a visit to Canberra each year by a committee of the New Zealand parliament and a return visit later the same year by a committee of the Commonwealth parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By convention, the Presiding Officers of the dispatching parliament determine the topic and the committee to participate in each exchange, and this decision is usually taken in consultation. This year is the Maori Language Year, and the Hon. Mr Peter Tapsell indicated that indigenous land rights would be an appropriate topic. Accordingly, the Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth parliament agreed that the joint committee should participate in the exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is grateful that, in a compact visit program over 3 1/2 days, there were several meetings with Maori. The visit began at Hamilton for that purpose. Our understanding of the settlement process in New Zealand was much enhanced through meeting with the Tainui and, subsequently, with the Ngai Tahu representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recorded that the visit was very successful as an exchange between the Australian and New Zealand parliaments. The exchange was cordial, informative and stimulating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that there are some aspects dealing with indigenous land rights which vary between New Zealand and Australia; in fact, markedly so. The first point is the significant proportion of Maori in the New Zealand population. Those who identify as Maori make up 13 per cent of the New Zealand population&mdash;a figure expected to increase to 15 per cent over the next 40 years. By the year 2031, the Maori population is projected to number about 672,000&mdash;54 per cent larger than in 1991. This contrasts, both in absolute figures and as a proportion, with the Australian indigenous community, which is believed to be less than 300,000 or, in percentage terms, 1.6 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect which was of interest in comparison was the concept of native title itself. In New Zealand, native title survived colonisation. Maori land, however, was significantly reduced over time through illegal confiscation and land sales. Importantly, New Zealand land rights have long been litigated on the basis of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. In Australia, native title was recognised for the first time in 1992 by the High Court and has survived colonisation only where it was not extinguished by land grants. Litigation on the basis of the Native Title Act has proceeded only since 1994. Therefore, New Zealand has had over 100 years more experience, you might say, in this area than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts have often found in favour of Maori claims about breaches of the treaty, and successful petitions have been made to the Privy Council. New Zealand Maori are in a strong position to assert their land rights as a consequence of the protection afforded by that treaty. The recent Tainui settlement had such a basis. By comparison, it was recognised by the Australian parliament in debating the Native Title Act that indigenous Australians would have only limited scope for the recognition of native title. The land fund was accordingly devised to ensure a more satisfactory level of restitution, particularly for those members of the indigenous community who could not make any successful claim under native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The options for litigation over the Waitangi Treaty depend in part on the fact that the treaty was negotiated with the British Crown. Under the Treaty of Waitangi Act, action concerning breaches of the treaty result in claims against the Crown. Private property is not subject to such claims, and claims cannot be brought against private individuals or organisations. The principle adopted in New Zealand is that past wrongs cannot be corrected by further unjust acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation contrasts with that prevailing in Australia where, except in those cases where native title has been extinguished by an inconsistent grant, native title may continue. Types of holdings that are subject to a valid claim remain to be determined by the courts, but nonetheless a variety of land holdings could be subject to native title claim, and it is not just the Crown against whom those claims are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect which was of some interest was the fact that under the Native Title Act indigenous Australians seek to establish ongoing connection with their country justifying determinations of native title. The National Native Title Tribunal attempts to mediate agreements between the parties. If agreement cannot be reached, the matter is referred to the Federal Court for determination. In New Zealand, emphasis is placed on the breaches of the rights under the Waitangi Treaty. The Waitangi Tribunal issues recommendatory reports. They can be utilised by the Office of Treaty Settlements which then negotiates settlements for the Crown. I might say that the committee had a most interesting meeting with the Chief Judge of the Waitangi Tribunal, Chief Judge Edward Durie&mdash;an outstanding man who is not only a credit to his people but also to his country. I think the committee learnt a great deal from him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect which was of interest was that New Zealand Maori placed very considerable significance on their insistence that the Crown apologise for breach of the treaty. The recent Tainui Deed of Settlement expressed the Crown's profound regret and apology and provided the recognition of the Waikato's principles: firstly, that as land was taken, land should be returned; and, secondly, that money is the acknowledgment by the Crown of its misdeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in relation to compensation, in Australia no limit has been placed on the amount of compensation that may be payable to indigenous people for the past extinguishment of native title. However, Australia has set up a land fund of some $1.4 billion, which will release $45 million per year through the Indigenous Land Corporation. In New Zealand, a fixed amount, $1 billion, has been identified by the present government as the envelope within which all treaty claims should be settled. That contrasts quite significantly in relation to the Australian situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to record the thanks of the committee to the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives for introducing the committee to the house and inviting it to the chamber for question time. I also wish to pay tribute to the hospitality of the Maori Affairs Committee and, in particular, its chairman, Mr Koro Wetere, who looked after us very well indeed and, in fact, was a source of great information to the committee. In fact, without Koro Wetere, I think the committee would have been at a distinct disadvantage, and I am sure Senator Chamarette would agree with me in that regard. All in all it was a most successful visit, and I would commend to the Senate the report in question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to associate myself with the sentiments that have just been expressed by Senator Ellison in relation to the report of the native title committee exchange with New Zealand of August 1995. I was delighted to be able to be part of that visit. I want to stress that, as part of the role of the ongoing Joint Committee on Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund of this parliament, it is very vital that such visits occur. Not only was this New Zealand visit very important: so too will be an examination of the progress on indigenous rights and native title issues in other countries, such as Canada and the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a comparative point of view, it was very useful to have meetings with both the committee and members of the New Zealand parliament and also to be out in the countryside looking at some of the issues that are very relevant and very important to the Maoris. In looking at the range of issues in relation to native title, I found that New Zealand seems to be very much ahead of Australia in quite a few areas, particularly with the Treaty of Waitangi, making it indisputable that Maori have rights in their own country and that those rights deserve recognition. However, similar problems exist for them. No doubt they are experienced in all parts of the world, particularly here in Australia. There seems to be a similar failure or delay and slowness of the government to recognise the rights that are indisputable by handing over crown land. There were indications that instead of them being handed over to Maori they were actually given to overseas interests. In some cases, national park status was granted as a way of eroding the rights of their ancestral land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wonderful highlights of the visit were the traditional welcomes at the beginning of almost every  interview or engagement and the respect for Maori culture that was expressed by pakeha. The bilingual, if not bi-cultural, aspects of discussions were very impressive. It stands as an indictment of non-Aboriginal Australia that we have not been able to offer the same kind of respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities when we meet in their areas. It was an extremely salutary experience to share in that acknowledgment of indigenous rights by the bi-cultural way in which issues were discussed and the use of language which underwrote that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will close these brief comments by referring to something which I believe was one of the most impressive things about the visit to New Zealand. The words at the beginning of the third report of the joint parliamentary committee on native title summarise this issue. I refer to a quote from Lord Normanby's instructions to Lieutenant-Governor Hobson on 14 August 1839. I wish that we could endorse the sentiments that were written here and fulfil them in our own approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All dealings with the Aborigines for their Lands must be conducted on the same principles of sincerity, justice and good faith as must govern your transactions with them for the recognition of Her Majesty's Sovereignty in the Islands. Nor is this all. They must not be permitted to enter into any Contracts in which they might be the ignorant and unintentional authors of injuries to themselves. You will not, for example, purchase from them any Territory the retention of which by them would be essential, or highly conducive, to their own comfort, safety or subsistence. The acquisition of Land by the Crown for the future Settlement of British Subjects must be confined to such Districts as the Natives can alienate without distress or serious inconvenience to themselves. To secure the observance of this rule will be one of the first duties of their official protector . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Just as those words stand as an indictment of all the dealings that have happened since 1839 in New Zealand, they stand as an indictment of people all around the world in relation to the indigenous rights of the people of their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This visit to New Zealand was very useful in continuing an exchange between the two countries that will be of certain benefit to us. I would be very pleased to see that committee come over and share with us in some of the struggles that we have in honouring the kinds of commitments that are illustrated in that quote. </PARA>

<PARA>The bilateral visit to Slovenia was headed by Mr Leo McLeay, the government whip and former Speaker, along with Senator Denman, Senator Woods and me. The secretary to the delegation was Mr Peter Keele. We were part of a short delegation which made a bilateral visit to Slovenia. Honourable senators might ask where Slovenia is. Slovenia is a very beautiful country, about one-third of the size of Tasmania, with a population of two million people. It was part of former Yugoslavia. It is bordered by Italy, Austria, Croatia and Hungary and it has a small portion bordering on the Adriatic Sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we left here we had a meeting with the charge d'affaires in Canberra, Mr Aljaz Gosnar, who painted in glowing terms to us what he believed we would enjoy of this beautiful little country. Everything he said was underrated. In fact, I think he did not really paint the true picture. He gave us a very mild view of what this particular country was about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a reasonable but significantly growing trade with Slovenia. Our two-way trade amounts to $48.7 million. We have about 30,000 Slovenian people living in Australia. So it was important that this first ever parliamentary delegation to Slovenia occurred. We were very pleased to know that Slovenia supports our candidature for the Security Council in the UN. On the other hand, we were one of the first countries to recognise Slovenia when it became a new nation after the disintegration of former Yugoslavia. Slovenia is currently caring for some 17,000 Muslim refugees from the war in former Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were all impressed with the work ethic in Slovenia. It really is a very small bustling country&mdash;a Western European type country that I highly recommend anybody to visit. In fact, the delegation formed the view that it would be a very good jumping off spot into central, northern and eastern Europe because it is centrally placed. It is still part of the Eastern Bloc; it is not yet part of the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were most impressed with the port of Koper, on the Adriatic, which is very close to Trieste. Koper, which is only an hour from Venice, is a very strategically located port. An Australian of Slovenian descent is organising a very well established duty-free trade zone called Toncity, which I believe would have very big advantages for business people coming out of Australia and wanting to enter Europe through a shorter and easier route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as tourism is concerned, it was said to us on more than one occasion that Slovenia is the best kept secret&mdash;I know this expression very well because it also could be said of Senator Denman's and my state&mdash;in Europe, just like Tasmania is the best kept secret in Australia. That phrase was often used as we moved around the small country. It certainly is a well kept secret. The capital, Ljubljana, is a very beautiful city. Before I went to Ljubljana, Senator Burns mentioned to me that he had been there. It is the home of an international wine show. Its architecture is very European. Piran and Portoroz, a couple of port cities or fishing villages on the Adriatic, are very Venetian in their outlook and are very colourful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a delegation believe that Slovenia can look forward to a very lucrative tourist industry. I believe the relations that we made with members of government and that followed through to the conference in Romania were very fruitful as far as Australia is concerned. As I said, we were there for only a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved on to the Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Bucharest in Romania, where we met up with our Speaker, who led the delegation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Inter-Parliamentary Conference was a very important one. I suppose from Australia's point of view the most important part was the supplementary item that was co-sponsored by Chile and New Zealand. That related to the adoption of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and its implications for continued nuclear tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference consisted of some 130-odd countries with almost 1,000 people involved. It is interesting to note that we had very little problem being accommodated because the headquarters for the conference was the former palace of executed Ceaucescu, former dictator of Romania. I remember Senator Burns describing to me the size of this building but, unless you have seen it, it is very hard to realise just how huge this place is. It is the second biggest building in the world, second only to the Pentagon, and is totally constructed out of marble. Its opulence is unbelievable to behold. There are something like 6,000 rooms in this place. Any one of them is bigger than the Great Hall here in Parliament House. We ran out of fingers when counting the chandeliers. There were literally hundreds of chandeliers throughout every building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the palace is not finished. It took 20 years to build. It took two million people to build and 25 per cent of the GDP of Romania for 20-odd years. For all that time, there was no food in the shops and the people were struggling. So it is really no wonder that the Romanians took hold of their leader and executed him on TV along with his wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt this building will go down in years to come as one of the wonders of the world, like the pyramids and so on. It looks as though the parliament will be moving into it, along with probably quite a few other important things. A part of the whole complex is a great Champs Elysees type promenade that stretches from the building to as far as the eye can see, although it does get lost in the smog in lower Bucharest. At the other end is almost a carbon copy of the Arc de Triomphe. They call Bucharest the Paris of the east. I think Ceaucescu tried to make it look like that but, in typical European fashion, a lot of the buildings are run down and a lot of things do not work, including the plumbing that was in my room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the important matter of nuclear testing: the Senate would be pleased to know that the final text of the adoption of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and its implications for continued tests was finally carried, with 933 affirmative votes, 65 negative votes and 356 abstentions. It was quite interesting that the leader of the French delegation made the point that these were old tests, that they should have been carried out four years previously. He concluded by saying that he had swum in the lagoon where the tests took place, that the last time was only two weeks previously and that he had not become radioactive. We thought that was quite unusual. Three other items of note were debated during the conference. I commend this report to those people who are interested in it. They certainly will find it very interesting reading. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the commitments of the conference, I did not have any time to see anything of Romania. But I would like to very briefly share with the Senate two things that I did do. One was that I visited an orphanage caring for children from birth to four years. In this orphanage there were 84 children. The children were cared for in groups of nine or 10 in three rooms per group. The orphanage was doing a superb job under very difficult circumstances. The rooms were brightly painted. One room was a bedroom, and two rooms were used as playrooms. The children were happy and they related well to the people looking after them. Because of difficulties due to the circumstances, the things that I saw there are a credit to the people of Romania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second visit I made was to a hospital caring for babies born with AIDS. My interest in that was to see what the Romanian people were doing about educating the people of their country with regard to safe sex, needle exchange and the AIDS problem generally. They have not by any means made an impact, but they have tried and are trying. They have very limited resources. Therefore, they are not able to get the message across to those who are most at risk. The ward I saw was sponsored by the Americans, so the equipment in that was probably superior to any other in the hospitals in Bucharest, and even that was very basic. That was a very moving experience. I feel privileged to have been able to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill is another asset sell off. It seems like I am speaking against these shoddy budget fiddling measures all the time these days. I do not imagine that the situation will continue, because there is very little left to sell, besides the physical infrastructure. However, we are already moving towards the sale of our national highways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this bill led the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, to make statements to the effect that any negative mention of this sale of the Commonwealth Bank by the opposition was purely spite because the Labor Party did it and now there is almost nothing to distinguish the Labor Party from the coalition. That was a more extreme statement than Senator Evans would have made in a reflective moment, but he was on a roll and it sounded like a good political point at the time. Unfortunately, it probably has more truth in it than most people would wish to acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why bother about the Commonwealth Bank anyway? It is, after all, just another big bank that puts the same nasty fees on pensioners and so on. The reason we oppose the sale is primarily on principle; and, secondly, because the Commonwealth Bank, in spite of its hard nosed corporate image, still has some obligations to the community. These will disappear. Unlike the airports act, there are no stipulations for community service obligations in this sale bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank was established in 1912, although the legislative basis was created the year before. It was an outgrowth of both the basic social philosophy of much of the labour movement and the specific economic disasters in private banking during the last decade of the 1800s. During that time a policy of non-prudential lending, coupled with speculation, led to the collapse of many banks and an even greater number which closed their doors for some period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also a basic plank of the international labour social movement that the people should, through government, be directly able to control those activities in their lives which established the parameters under which they lived and where the nature of social infrastructure made it a natural monopoly. In particular, energy, water, communications, transport and banking were seen as essential areas to have under public control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to banking in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank always operated on the principle that it was a public presence in a private banking environment, except for the brief period during the Chifley government when an attempt was made to nationalise all banks. Much of the push for nationalisation at that time was an outcome of the Great Depression. The speculation and non-prudential lending of the post-war 1920s led not only to the Great Depression but ultimately to attempts to regulate much of the financial sector, including through the establishment of the International Monetary Fund which originally was designed to combat speculation and regulate currency&mdash;a function almost opposite to what it does today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank has been conceived as an agency to give a measure of stability to the financial sector, to ensure certain practices and services are available and to promote the sort of development government, as representatives of polity, believed to be of value to Australia. It has actually performed many of these functions. It helped form the commodity pools, the wheat and wool boards, at a time when there was extreme uncertainty in the agricultural sector. The Commonwealth Development Bank provided financing for agricultural and industrial projects which otherwise may have gone unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here I digress to point out that the Japanese and other Asian tigers have also followed a program of intentionally and aggressively promoting certain types of development through direct intervention rather than relying on market forces which would have kept them as low wage, high labour content nations. The Reserve Bank was also formed out of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank has also been directly involved in providing service to communities. Senators who have spent much time in rural areas will realise, if they think about it for a moment, how many small communities have only one bank&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;even if it is only a passport agency at the local post office. There is a commitment to the community there that every community should have access to banking at some level. What other bank has such a commitment? A few of the state banks spring to mind as possible examples. But of course state banks have virtually disappeared, with the decision to sell the Rural and Industry Bank of Western Australia&mdash;now called Bank West in a tribute to Professor Spooner&mdash;to the Scots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, since the 1950s there has been a steady erosion of both the concept and the practice of public banks as agents of development, regulation or social equity provision. We have seen the banks restructured, corporatised, turned into government business enterprises and turned into private companies in which government simply has majority share. At each step of this process the banks become less accountable to the public and there is an increasing onus placed on government not to interfere with the normal commercial operations of these companies. This means that any ability to promote social goals is reduced, while the ability of government to manage in the absence of regulation also disappears. Effectively, banks are turned from an agent of development and social service into just an investment of public money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As unfortunate, in my opinion, as the recent trend has been, it does not alter the principle that the people should have the collective ability to directly affect issues of finance, banking and fund provisions. For that reason alone we would not support selling off the Commonwealth Bank. The fact that it is operating as just another bank&mdash;imposing the same bad interest rates and the same fees and charges on small savers and following the same kind of investment policy&mdash;does not mean that the people, through government, should lose all ability to reclaim this asset as a functional tool of social reform and financial stability. That is what selling off the bank would mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is difficult for anyone in either big party to imagine not selling the bank, it is entirely inconceivable that there would be a party in power in the near future who would establish a new government owned national bank. The decision to sell is therefore functionally an irrevocable abandonment of the public right and power to directly participate in banking. It is far more than the simple sale of an asset. In principle, we cannot support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, the sale raises a number of questions. As I have noted, many rural communities are too small to attract any commercial bank to establish an outlet. So far they have been serviced because either the state banks or the Commonwealth Bank have a social commitment to provide such services. There are examples of synergy here that I have noted before. Where the cost of establishing any government agency or presence in a community may require substantial subsidy of its own, the common practice of multiple use&mdash;the original one-stop shop&mdash;has allowed a post office to act as agent for a range of services, including banking. Government departments can work together on the basis that they are owned and serve the people, so can engage in cost savings and ensure public access across departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that arises from the sale is: what will happen in relation to these small communities? Will a private Commonwealth Bank spend money to ensure rural communities have access to banking? Will it put in the capital for very long distance computer lines or satellite down links in order to service a handful of customers? How will the maintenance of these facilities be justified when the profit margins on an automatic teller machine in the city core, or urban business services, are so much better?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My guess is that rural banking will go the way of so many other rural services: they will be shifted to regional centres, requiring huge unproductive and inefficient inputs of time, money and energy for rural people in order to raise the `productivity and efficiency' of the banks. Of course, maybe everyone will join the Internet, sponsored by Telstra and Bill Gates, and will do their banking on-line. And maybe trickle-down economics will make the world's rich poor. I doubt it. But I look forward to seeing what the changes will be for this service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also be interesting to see what happens in relation to postal agencies. All postal agencies in rural areas still act as agencies for the Commonwealth Bank. Will the post offices continue to act as agents for the privatised Commonwealth Bank? Will they have a policy to act as agents for any bank that asks? Will this be a special sweetener in the Commonwealth Bank sale? Will they stop the service? What will they charge? Competitive rates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is going to buy the Commonwealth Bank? My guess is that there are several major international banks that would love to establish a presence in Australia but have been constrained by the difficulty of breaking into such a market from scratch. But, if they could take over or gain a controlling share of the Commonwealth Bank, they would be in. But whose interests and decisions would their policies reflect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with some concern that when we propose to privatise even management of airports there is a whole large bill setting out some of the regulations, obligations and so on that the private sector must operate under. Where we privatise the Commonwealth Bank there is nothing&mdash;no community service obligations, nothing. It is seen as inappropriate to impose those on a single bank. So any social function the Commonwealth Bank continues to perform is simply written off as collateral damage&mdash;as expendable and unimportant in the push for privatisation. For this reason, as well as the principle, we cannot support the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisation, like any asset, is always put forward as a huge win&mdash;a massive windfall for government and government revenue. Economically this is quite incorrect. An asset is just that: an asset&mdash;something good we have; something we have put money into, usually for a purpose other than pure investment. The money from such a sale is not new money. It is, hopefully, at least the current market value of that asset. It is not a gain at all. As an asset, the value may also rise in value. A business, as a form of asset, will also generate income. This is aside from the more obvious use value of a government owned service provider. That income will be forgone. Just a few years down the track we will be down in our budget figures because of this sale. No, the Greens will not support this bill. We believe the sale of the Commonwealth Bank will be a sad day for the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Bank sale marks the end of an historic era. In the 19th century governments saw the establishment of savings banks and the promotion of thrift as means for promoting the development of Australian colonies and ensuring that working people could build up a safety net against financial vicissitudes. Thus the Savings Bank of New South Wales was established in 1832. Government savings banks were actually operated through the post office. Some of us are old enough to remember that. It is perhaps a sign of the times that not only the Commonwealth Bank is being sold but also the beautiful Savings Bank of New South Wales building in Barrack Street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some will say that habits of thrift and prudence are old-fashioned and that we have no need of a government bank. I do not agree. At a time when Australia is `dissaving' as never before, when we are running record current account deficits and Australian domestic savings have plummeted to almost nil, I think we should reconsider the virtues of a past era when governments thought they had a public duty to build for the future rather than to spend for the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank is both a symbol and the reality of what is wrong with much of this government's economic policy. We are engaged in a sell-off and a sell-out&mdash;a sell-off of the family silver, a sell-out of traditional Labor Party and labour movement policies, and a sell-out of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Andrew Fisher's Labor government established the Commonwealth Bank just before the First World War&mdash;I think it was in 1912&mdash;it was an action of a Labor government that believed in the dignity of the working man and woman. Labor governments of those times believed in thrift and self-improvement. They believed that working people should be encouraged to lift themselves up and not be turned into state welfare dependents. They valued cooperative and mutual self-help. Thus they believed in tax exemptions for credit unions, friendly societies and trustee savings banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government's philosophies are different. It does not believe in fostering collective self-help by working people. It has increased the tax on credit unions and friendly societies. It is introducing tax legislation which will facilitate the demutualisation of life assurance societies so that these repositories of people's savings will no longer be under the control of the worker and member policy holders. This government did nothing to defend the interests of members who were presented with a misleading and deceptive attempt to demutualise the NRMA in New South Wales. It is introducing penalties on friendly societies in the new deeming rules for social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, apparently, does not believe that working people should be empowered to save; they should be forced to save and have no say where their savings go. I do not see any virtue in this government's claim that working people should be forced to save when it is selling off assets in the greatest case of asset stripping since the disposal of crown lands by the colonies in the 19th century. How can the government lecture working people on the need to save when it has taxed them into the ground and stripped them of any surplus income out of which they might have saved? How can this government talk about savings when it is investing so little in infrastructure that it has invented a new payroll tax, called the superannuation levy, designed to create a new pool of money to make up for its failure to invest in infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not favour this bill. It seems to have been conceived as a last minute, headline grabbing exercise to claim a budget surplus in the last budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis). This sale does nothing to generate a real budget surplus. About the only thing to be said for it is that the bank will be rid of a shareholder that no longer believes in investing in anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is an epitaph marking a loss of national vision. It tells us that we no longer have a government that believes in nation building, in saving for the future or in economy in government, which will sell anything to pay for promises that it cannot keep, and which believes that massaging the media on budget night is more important than genuinely good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I say these things with some feeling. As you know, I was concerned very strongly by the attempt to castrate the Commonwealth Bank many years ago&mdash;an attempt that was proposed by a conservative government. You can call me sentimental, if you like, and say that I am not facing up to the real economic world. You might say that I have failed to recognise that the Commonwealth Bank is operating as just another bank. I do not fail to recognise that but I had hoped that whilst ever the Commonwealth was the majority shareholder in this enterprise the principles upon which the bank was founded by Andrew Fisher might have been enforced upon the bank and might have prevailed. It is obvious that the representatives of the major shareholder, the Commonwealth, have not pursued these principles for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make mention of something that has just occurred to me. I understood at the time of the sale of Commonwealth Bank shares that the government undertook to retain the majority shareholding in the bank. That undertaking is being undermined by this legislation. What of the people who have invested on the basis of that undertaking? Where are they? Was that a false prospectus?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I should apologise, particularly to the government, for some of the things that I have said because I said them with feeling. I tend not to criticise in those terms generally but I feel very strongly about this matter and everything I have said I believe to be accurate. I oppose most strongly the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say, Senator, you then have to take a major decision that the government will intervene and underwrite those applications for loans that are considered more risky, because they will not get them from the private sector. I have to say, coming from the state of South Australia that when banks in South Australia or Victoria were allowed to go out during the 1980s, they made a number of catastrophic decisions, for which, in the end, the taxpayer had to pick up the loss. In my state it was to the tune of over $3 billion. That was all done by an independent board, appointed in accordance with the legislation, which said that the then State Bank had to be at arms-length from the government. So it was at arms-length, but in the end, when they made bad decisions on investment, the bottom line was the taxpayers of South Australia had to bail out the State Bank of South Australia to the tune of $3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>

If there had been an attempt by Treasury and the state Treasurer to run the State Bank of South Australia closely, there would have been indications of government interference, political interference in the lending processes of that bank. The bank's legislation was established to make sure that that did not occur. So the bank had an independent board and it went off and did what it did.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`(2C) The Commonwealth must not reduce its shareholding in the Development Bank or, as a shareholder, agree to any proposed amendment of the memorandum and articles of the Development Bank unless each House of the Parliament, by resolution, approves a proposal for such an amendment.".</PARA>
<PARA>My amendment is to the schedule. This amendment seeks, as I said in my speech at the second reading stage, to ensure that the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank cannot be bartered away between the Commonwealth Bank and future Treasurers because, as they see it, there are some fiscal imperatives to produce so-called budget surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to minimise the number of losers from this inappropriate privatisation. It seeks to ensure that these losers do not include the rural and small business operators who make up the clientele of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The amendment makes it clear that, prior to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the future role and funding of the Development Bank is finalised and in a written agreement. This agreement would incorporate the charter activities currently set out in sections 72, 73 and 74 of the Commonwealth Banks Act. The clause would require that the memorandum and articles of the Commonwealth Development Bank would require that the charter could not be altered without the approval of 95 per cent of shareholders' equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the amendment then requires that the Commonwealth cannot sell its share below five per cent or agree to changes to the charter without a resolution of both houses of the parliament&mdash;none of this ministerial whim. This will guarantee that, before the Commonwealth Development Bank role changes, there must be public debt. Through the parliament, the rural and small business sectors who rely heavily on the Development Bank will be able to have a say as to whether the proposed changes should or should not be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is attempting to put into black letter law the first limb of what we just saw in the opposition's second reading amendment. It is an opportunity for the Senate to say to the government, `Listen, we are not buying these empty assurances. We are very dubious about commitments given that are later breached. We are no longer prepared to make a pyrrhic stand on the second reading and then hope maybe that the government gets the message.' It does not work like that. It is quite clear that, unless we guarantee the future of the Development Bank in black letter law, the Commonwealth Development Bank will cease to exist, probably sooner rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government assures us, `Don't worry, all will be well. The Development Bank charter will be incorporated into a written, legally enforceable agreement between the minister and the Commonwealth Bank and the agreement is already largely complete.' The first part of my amendment provides a legislative necessity for completing this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the agreement makes it clear that the Commonwealth Bank will only agree not to amend the charter while there is an adequate subsidy in place. As I remarked in the second reading debate, I do not get the impression that the Commonwealth Bank is terribly keen on its charter business. Its annual report made that pretty clear when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it.</PARA>
<PARA>Read carefully, that means the Commonwealth Bank does not see any community service obligation in continuing to provide a lender of the last resort facility to rural and small business operators, unless it can make a good buck out of it or unless the government pays. Why should it? It is a private company and its shareholders will expect a return on their investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But trying to place community service obligations into a contract is not as preferable as placing them in legislation. This amendment is a compromise: it leaves them in the contract and in the memorandum and articles of association; but it makes it clear that the federal Treasurer, as the minority shareholder, will take his instructions from parliament on how he will act. The amendment also makes it abundantly clear well in advance of the float that the Commonwealth Bank will have to abide by the charter whether it likes it or not. In that way, it can discount the value of its shares according to the restriction, if it needs to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a little bit about community service obligations&mdash;not a lot. As I am finding myself saying more regularly here, the whole concept of the public interest is a dying concept in this brave new world. But the community service obligations of the Development Bank are very important; they are too important just to be ditched like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth does play a vital role in rural finance, which the Democrats believe we should not relinquish&mdash;especially now with the financial pressures existing in the area of rural finance. Despite what Senator Schacht has said, I do think the Development Bank plays a vital role in small business finance. We have a third of the small businesses still reporting that they are constrained by finance, and the Development Bank has a continuing role to play in plugging that hole in our financial system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Democrats are of the very firm view that the Development Bank should not be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have been told all about how times change, that there is no role left for government to have a bank with which to set standards of any sort and that that has all gone. Even if there were an argument that the Commonwealth Bank as a whole is operating on a purely commercial basis with no real public interest constraint, the role of the Development Bank is different. It does have community service obligations and public interest constraints; they are set out in sections 72 to 74 of the Commonwealth Bank Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we say a public sector intervention role is not fashionable or appropriate, I think we should look at where else it has been employed recently in legislation. The first thing I would point to is the One Nation package in 1992, with its capital injection of $30 million and a continuing $20 million subsidy to ensure that the financing of projects which would not otherwise qualify for assistance indeed do qualify. Working Nation committed a further $2 million to the Development Bank for the advertising of its services to the small business sector. So the government recognises the strategic importance of a body like the Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bank should stay in public hands. It is really regrettable that the government is so determined to sell it. To the opposition parties, and to all of those who have made the observation in the debate that `We cannot incur these liabilities; we cannot expect privatised entities to have to carry any kind of community service obligation', I would point out that it is not unusual to privatise a public utility, subject to that entity maintaining certain community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some examples. In Victoria, there is the office of the regulator-general holding a watching brief over privatised utilities. The sale of the State Bank of New South Wales was subject to the new owners agreeing to a long list of conditions about the carrying on of New South Wales business, the security of employees, maintaining a New South Wales emphasis, and so on. In this parliament, when we were debating the sale of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline, that ended up being made subject to an access regime. Also, in the Qantas sale, a string of conditions exist entrenching Australian control of the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what has the good old Development Bank done wrong? Why not add this to the Development Bank? Aren't its community service obligations of sufficient value and importance to rural producers and small business to be preserved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition is not prepared to sanction a community service obligation such as this being entrenched ahead of privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, we have to ask the question, for example: if you have won government and gone ahead and privatised Telstra, why aren't rural communities and consumers of Telstra entitled to believe that you will do away with the current Telstra community service obligations? If you will not support them now for the Commonwealth Development Bank, what makes it any different for Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to the opposition, but I say to the National Party in particular: we have seen much hand wringing and heard much angst, we have seen the statements that have been made in the other place, but a second reading amendment is not good enough. You profess to be very worried about the future of the Development Bank; here is the solution. Let us put the whole role and the financing of the Development Bank into a disallowable regulation&mdash;and that enshrining the charter. Let us guarantee a future for this lender of the last resort, commonly known and appreciated as the farmer's friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have an end once and for all to all this wailing and gnashing of teeth against a measure on the one hand, and then a very convenient quiet little voting for it on the other. You are about to be tested, Senator McGauran, Senator Boswell, if you are listening, and other members of the National Party. It is not good enough to stand up and say how terrible it is and then vote for it. I commend this amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be voting for this amendment. I share the Democrats' concern about the Commonwealth Development Bank, and I think we made that clear in our amendment in the second reading debate. But we do not believe that it is right for the government, in getting out of the Commonwealth Bank, divesting itself of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Commonwealth Bank, selling it, to be retaining an eight per cent share. The Treasurer would then come back in with a disproportionate power. He would come back with virtually the same power over the Development Bank as that which the government held previously. That just goes against the principle of privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that the Treasurer should have the same degree of involvement in a privatised Commonwealth Bank as he did in the past when the Commonwealth was a major shareholder. Let us face it, the major concern we have about the Commonwealth Development Bank is the loss of the subsidy. No matter which political party or parties may make up the government of the day, if that subsidy is there, open and up-front for everybody to see, then the government of the day will be showing its true colours: whether, in fact, it supports the Development Bank and, through that, small business and the rural sector&mdash;not by some other deal which is being done through the backdoor, as may have been occurring in the past. That was our concern: that the subsidy by the government of the day would continue to be paid to the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the government of the day may decide to assist small business and the rural sector in other ways, not just through the Development Bank. That is a decision for the government at the time. What we are on about today is a complete privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I am going to tell you about the farmers, Senator Kernot, if you will stop bleating. The reason being that a future government may choose to deal with this in an entirely different way. A future government may decide, for example, to leave the Commonwealth Development Bank in there and to take the loan portfolio out of the assets to be privatised and put it into a different entity. A future government may find different ways in which it wishes to assist small business and the transfer of the loan portfolio out of the bank before it is sold might be the appropriate way to do that. The amendment that Senator Kernot has put before the chamber denies a future government that opportunity. That is why I think the amendment is short-sighted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot should understand that there are very real reasons why we, on this side of the chamber, do not concur with her. It is not that we do not care about farmers&mdash;we care about farmers a great deal more, judging by some of the nonsense that has come out of the Democrats&mdash;but our concern is to do things the right way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Kernot is doing has the potential to reduce the attractiveness of the remaining tranche of the Commonwealth Bank because institutional investors of the bank will say, `We have concerns as to how independent it can really be because we are going to have this federal Treasurer leaning over the bank's shoulders at every opportunity, every time there is some political pressure.' That is inappropriate, that is short-sighted and it shows that Senator Kernot does not understand the sensitivity of the market when you come to do these privatisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that I do happen to know a little more about privatisations and the capital markets than Senator Kernot and anything of this nature runs the risk of degrading the value of the remaining stake in the bank.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the rationale behind Senator Kernot's amendment. The problem we see is that government wants to have its cake and eat it too. I think it might end up not having it, not eating it and it might seem a much simpler outcome. The government wants to sell the Commonwealth Development Bank along with the Commonwealth Bank. At the same time it wants the programs and loans of the Development Bank to continue. It proposes to sell the bank with a guaranteed subsidy to assure this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wants to keep the Development Bank going. I cannot understand why it cannot, as a majority owner of the Commonwealth Bank, sell the Development Bank to the Commonwealth. It would then administer the Development Bank in whatever way it likes and promote the policies it likes in the most direct manner. It would be ultimately accountable to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see that as a bad thing. It makes far more sense than to sell the Development Bank along with the Commonwealth Bank, have the new owners of the Commonwealth Bank onsell the Development Bank and then have the government subsidise an unknown private sector owner to attempt to have an influence on its practice. Frankly, the latter course seems to be a virtual guarantee of a bad outcome. The government objective is to primarily sell the Development Bank. I guess it can do so. Either it should have a vehicle for acting upon investment policy or it should abandon it or it should regulate that all banks have certain obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This creation of a high bred private sector quasi government business enterprise reminds me of nothing more than the government's attempt to create a private sector superannuation industry that it can run to accomplish its policy objectives outside of parliamentary scrutiny. It is bad practice and the success of such a strategy is extremely dubious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrat amendment is substantive. It effectively says that the Commonwealth cannot sell the Commonwealth Bank until 15 sitting days after it gets an agreement, including the whole raft of things that have been specified under proposed section 3A. We have some problems with this amendment, as I mentioned. I understand the intent and appreciate what the Democrats are trying to do here, but I think the effect is to make the government's scheme work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Democrats' function section, subsection A, they basically outcome a good intention for the Development Bank to continue as was originally intended&mdash;that is, to provide funds for industry and primary producers, especially small business. But the test is in the opinion of the Development Bank, which would now be in private hands. Its opinion may vary significantly from that of government or parliament. In subsection B, it seeks to tie a private bank to accordance with policies approved by the Treasurer. In other words, it seeks to make a private bank exactly the sort of quasi government business enterprise that I referred to above. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no provision at all for such an organisation to report to parliament, in spite of the fact it still gets government subsidy, and no provision at all for the Treasury to be accountable for the policies promoted or endorsed in regard to such a quasi GBE. This is a dangerous precedent. The fact that the Democrats have proposed a general definition of functions does not make it less dangerous, since it is clearly a definition subject to interpretation. It cannot be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final section on contributions may also be a problem in that it is an undefined agreement for expenditure of Commonwealth money, with no real mechanism for accountability of either the Development Bank or the minister. I am sure that estimates would just show it as an expenditure for subsidy of share subscription as a public company rather than a true public sector company&mdash;the Development Bank. It would not even need to give parliament an annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, although I appreciate the sense in which it is put forward, and although we all feel fairly desperate and depressed by this whole measure, we cannot support the amendment. As I have indicated, if the Commonwealth wishes to ensure loans are available for certain purposes and to have some measure of control over such investments, it should do so through a business which it directly and accountably controls. </PARA>

Such is her emotion on this bill&mdash;and in many respects rightly so. There is a great deal of community attachment to the Commonwealth Bank, given its origins and its ideals, which go back to 1912.

In my own state of Victoria when the State Bank collapsed in 1990 and was, ironically, taken over by the Commonwealth Bank, such was the attachment of the local investors that they were not willing to transfer their funds to another bank, even though it was the Commonwealth Bank. They saw the Bank of Melbourne as a great opportunity to keep their money in the state, as they viewed it. I am glad there is a sentimental attachment to the banking sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. It is one thing to provide a subsidy of $20 million&mdash;I think that was the amount last year&mdash;for the bank because it had the community obligation and it had, presumably, the government looking over its shoulder to ensure that the community obligation was observed. It is another thing entirely for the government to act in a similar fashion when the bank is privatised and this obligation is simply part of an agreement. What I am asking you, and pointing out as well, is: what happens in future years in respect of that particular agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I will just point out to you that the shareholding for the CDB will be 91.9 per cent by the CBA and 8.1 per cent by the Commonwealth. I am advised that is the existing shareholding structure of the Commonwealth Development Bank. That is not changing, and the subsidy that they were getting is the arrangement of the subsidy continuing. Obviously the amount may well change from time to time and will be debated in the parliament as part of the budget appropriation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not selling the Commonwealth Development Bank. We are not changing the existing structure in shareholding arrangements of the Commonwealth Development Bank. I think that ought to be put on the record and made quite clear. The subsidy arrangement is presently being provided on an annual basis through the appropriation bills. The outlays, when printed in the budget outlays, are for the Treasurer, who is responsible for the Treasury department and for the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just point out to the committee that it is not the same shareholding arrangement. What you have is 91 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Trading Bank, which in turn is majority owned by the Commonwealth. You cannot get up here and say it is the same ownership; in other words, that the Commonwealth does not have the same say and muscle over what happens. So really it is not appropriate for you to get up here and suggest that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I accept that point, Senator Harradine: that because the Commonwealth Bank will own 91.9 per cent of the Commonwealth Development Bank, now that the Commonwealth Bank is totally sold off, that 91.9 per cent now has a different combination because it is partly owned by the private sector and partly owned by the Commonwealth. I accept that. But I have pointed out that the agreement for the operation of the Commonwealth Development Bank will be a shareholders' agreement and a memorandum of understanding, and that will be made public. So the way the subsidy will work will be publicly transparent. Obviously someone may disagree with it, but it will be publicly transparent. Obviously each year there will be a line in the outlays for the Treasurer's department saying what the subsidy is for the Commonwealth Development Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the point you may well make is that it is in the appropriation and it is a bit hard to get up and move an amendment in view of this changing the budget and stopping supply and so on. I am sure a public debate about the size, or the lack of size, of the subsidy or how the subsidy is being used would create more than a passing interest in the community. Any government which tried to be a bit slippery about it, to use that term, would have to take its chances of the public opprobrium of not being able to justify what it did. I think that public transparency is the major protection. In view of the fact that there is a lot of interest on all sides of this chamber, no matter how people are voting here&mdash;and we have had an example of some members of the National Party&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will be supporting the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2). The purpose of the bill is to give effect to certain 1995-96 budget initiatives announced in May this year. Firstly, there will be a cessation of the gifted and talented children's scheme, resulting in a saving of $1.1 million during the 1996 calendar year. Secondly, there will be a cessation of the gender equity program, resulting in a saving of $1.5 million a year. Thirdly, there will be a cessation of the rural hostels program, resulting in a saving of $1.1 million a year. Fourthly, there will be the commencement of transitional support in non-government schools to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream school education or pursue further training or employment. This program involves an additional expenditure of $3.2 million in the calendar year 1996. Fifthly, there will be an extension of the early literacy program, leading to the expenditure of an additional $8.9 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing the measures in this bill. In taking this position the coalition is not giving its imprimatur to the decisions made by the government which are included in the bill. Indeed, in office the coalition may well look again at some of these decisions. The government's actions in the 1995-96 budget mean that no new grants will be provided in 1996 for key programs in primary and secondary schools, such as the program to improve the learning experience of girls and the special project for non-government rural schools student hostels. They also mean an end to the program to assist gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These decisions are all very short-sighted and educationally unsound. However, it is clearly unreasonable to ask the coalition to act as a de facto government in this instance and make judgments about expenditure priorities to this level of detail when it does not have the advantage of the advice and perspective of the government's many public servants. It is for this reason the coalition will establish a commission of audit immediately following the next election. After 13 years of Labor government and Labor expenditure, it is not only necessary but vital that Australia takes a very detailed and critical look at how and where the government spends the people's resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides funds to extend a number of programs introduced by the government over recent years. It also withdraws funding from a number of other programs. Where the government has withdrawn funding from programs, I would welcome the government explaining to the Senate on what efficiency and effectiveness grounds those decisions have been made. If efficiency and effectiveness were not grounds for withdrawing funds, the question needs to be raised as to why funding was provided in the first place. What performance measures were established for the programs, and what evaluations were conducted of these programs? These are not merely academic questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's own reform of the Public Service, performance measures should have been applied to these programs and it should have been on the basis of evaluation of these performance measures that the government made these decisions to withdraw funds. The coalition would welcome the government advising the Senate on these matters. The decision in the bill to withdraw funding for the three programs that I mentioned earlier were the decisions of a Labor cabinet, a Labor government, advised by the Public Service but with responsibility for decisions resting entirely with the Labor Party, its ministers and its parliamentary representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition wants the government to be judged by the Australian people on this sort of record. Its record will now include withdrawal of funding from the gifted and talented children's program, from the disadvantaged and isolated girls program and from an access to school scheme for isolated children from rural communities. Let the government defend its record. The coalition will not be opposing these measures in the states grants bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been told in some detail by Senator Tierney about the provisions of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2). There is no way I can disagree with his description. It is accurate and quite succinct. But I am a little concerned about the circle that he drew in attempting to explain where the coalition was getting any logic from in its position. It went something along the lines we heard before the 1993 election: we are not going to oppose this but when we get into government we are going to have another look at it. That leaves most people in Australia somewhat confused, if not concerned. You either support a bill for the reasons it deserves to be supported or you are not informed enough about an issue to adopt a position which is a position you will continue to have next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats think it is much more honest to state the position and then to stick by that position. I seem to recall we had this argument when the pensioner shares issue was debated, which pursued us in this place for some time. I recall it being trotted out on a number of other issues as well. The opposition is not prepared to oppose it but is prepared to suggest that somehow or other it would be a priority for a different government. We are told in the second reading speech of the minister&mdash;it occupies one page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that the elements of programs which are to be cut by this bill are initiatives that have served their purpose or are now more appropriately the responsibility of other bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, Senator Tierney, was a keen participant, as I was, in an inquiry conducted by the Senate Education, Employment and Training References Committee into state-federal financial relations. As chair of that committee, Senator Tierney has chaired inquiries into various aspects of education on which state and federal financial relationships impinge strongly. Senator Tierney and I have heard witnesses from all around Australia who are concerned about the way education in Australia is heading. He and I have heard a great number of witnesses suggest that they are concerned about the way state education departments are taking opportunities to use federal money to meet the obligations that the state departments have and have abrogated their responsibilities and are not properly funding state education. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tierney says, by way of interjection, that it is something which is very difficult to measure. He and I have heard time after time witnesses saying that tied grants at least identify the end purpose of the money and can be evaluated as to whether the money was spent on that which it was intended to be spent on. We have three programs which are identifiable, which have had a priority attached to them and on which the electorate at large can see whether their money has been spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are concerned that this government and the state governments are making arrangements, whether at ministerial councils or at COAG meetings, on how the federal-state financial arrangements will be arrived at and where the spending priorities will be. Those arrangements are then brought into this chamber for what is best described as ratification. Sometimes it is more accurately described as rubber stamping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last occasion I recall that happening was when Minister Cook suggested that one of these concoctions&mdash;it was not in the education area but in another area&mdash;should not be amended, modified, changed, challenged or even looked at carefully by this chamber because it was subject to `the weight of agreement of all the states of Australia and the federal government'. I think that was Senator Cook's phrase. The implication was: who the heck are we to put up our hand and say, `Excuse me'? That is turning the role of this place and the role of the federal parliament into one which it was not designed to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia are not silly. They recognise the threat to their sovereignty and their democratic processes. They recognise the threat that this arrangement brings about. I am not suggesting for one moment that this bill has been through that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In removing three specific programs, the government is heading towards a trend which has not been supported by those people who have brought their evidence to committees at which I have shared the inquiry table with Senator Tierney. Those people are concerned about this trend and would like us to do something about its continuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I received a letter from the National Association for Rural Student Accommodation Inc. It is dated 22 November this year. It is current. This is a concern which is held by the group. I will read only the first part, which will enable the Senate to understand the direction of the concerns. It is a little too detailed to take any further. It is addressed to me. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask that you take urgent representation on our behalf in support of the enclosed Submission to the Commonwealth Government, presented to Ross Free, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, seeking his urgent consideration of funding to the Association from January 1996, to enable NARSA to undertake an ambitious three year program of information, training and communication support and professional development for the rural student hostel industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This group is writing about these concerns at a time when the government is making cuts to a program which is directly associated with this group's concerns. It may well be that the association is doing a post-stable door operation. It may also well be that this is reflective of the government saying that such an initiative is now more appropriately the responsibility of another body. I do not know. I have not had time to go into the details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the government is informed. I hope Minister Free pays attention to the concerns of this group. I hope the government is not cutting a program which is in the interests of the group that has written to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other parts of the bill which deserve comment have been mentioned by Senator Tierney. It makes it very hard to adopt a position which totally opposes these provisions, because the government is expending more money in the areas of disabilities integration and the extension of early literacy. They are significant amounts and are worthy of support and even congratulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that all these proposals have been lumped in together. Our concerns about gifted and talented students, the gender issues and rural hostels have been cut while other areas have been expanded. My position on this is that the entire funding of education in Australia is seen as the problem area by the people who made submissions to and appeared as witnesses at a number of inquiries and committee hearings that I have attended. They have also communicated in person with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A collection of their concerns is being represented by the trend to fund education either under general purpose grants or in a manner which removes the capacity of this chamber and this parliament to amend, to oppose, to comment or to modify. Those processes are taking place in another forum&mdash;not a representative forum but a forum which is exclusive and in which negotiations can take place without being influenced by the parliamentary process. It is of great concern to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the coalition will not oppose this bill, we feel cheated of the capacity to exercise our democratic right to change the bill. Because the government has bundled these provisions into one bill, we also feel cheated of the opportunity to take a significant stand on them. We are frustrated by this. I take this opportunity to express that frustration. I do not promise that the Democrats will grant passage to this concoction. I will listen to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Customs Tariff Bill and associated bills&mdash;the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. We are debating these bills cognately. I will address first of all the Customs Tariff Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to redraft and consolidate the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and to incorporate the harmonised commodity description and coding system classification modifications. This system was developed in 1988 as a classification system for administrating imports and exports and for collecting foreign trade data. This system was established by the Customs Cooperation Council, which is an international body of which Australia is a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harmonised system is now known as the harmonised description and coding system and is the international tariff system sponsored by the World Customs Organisation in Brussels. The new system will replace the former outdated one by providing a universal six-digit code removing old domestic subheadings and the archaic tailored Australian tariff. Once implemented the universal classification and coding system will be of assistance to international trade. This universal code is essential in the modern world of the global economy where a countless number of goods are being traded internationally at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system will incorporate new products that have come on to the international trade market in recent years. Value added, technically advanced products and components emerge without a suitable separate tariff classification to cater for them, which leads to the introduction of these new classifications. Australia is adopting the classification changes as agreed and will be adding 200 national tariff splits to maintain its tariff program. The harmonised system is essential to the collection and quantification of foreign trade statistics. This is essential for Australia to monitor trends in world trade so that we can develop essential mercantile strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New item 17 of the bill tightens the eligibility definition in respect of goods that are exported from Australia and may be altered overseas. This is where Australian industry sends materials overseas to be enhanced using relatively cheap foreign labour and then to enjoy a duty-free return to Australia. This item introduces a more surgical definition which will discourage labour going overseas for Australian products. The bill provides for the duty-free importation of goods which are replaced under a safety recall. This covers goods which are being sent to consumers to compensate them for a product they have already purchased which has a design fault or safety concern. It also allows for the duty-free return of goods which are part of a repair process to replace goods exported from Australia for repair or renovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main body of the bill is a technical implementation of a more updated system to administer imports and exports in Australian customs and to collect statistics on foreign trade. This in effect constitutes a consolidation of the original act. The new provisions in this legislation are reasonable additions in the interests of Australian labour, industry and consumers. The coalition supports the implementation of a new tariff classification regime in order that Australia becomes a cooperative and efficient player in world trade. We must not jeopardise Australia's ability to meet its international agreements, especially in respect of trade, and must maintain our reputation as a facilitator of trade. It is a pity the Labor Party continues to tarnish its image on this front with its multiple failures in the realm of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill contains five schedules of amendments to enact a range of changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The main purpose of the bill is to increase the excise on light fuel oil. This provision is in schedule 4. Schedule 4 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and had effect from 1 July 1995. The schedule provides statutory enforcement to the custom tariff proposal already tabled in parliament which proposes an increase in the excise on light fuel oil as defined in the bill. The increase will bring the rate of excise on light fuel oil up to the same rate as diesel fuel. There have been operators who have shifted to using light fuel oil to take advantage of the reduced excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains other amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Schedule 1 amends the act and had effect from 17 March 1995. This amendment follows an Industry Commission report which inquired into the customs commercial tariff and by-laws system in 1990-91. This amendment will change the tariff treatment of textiles used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft. Textiles used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft are subject to a concessional rate of duty of two per cent. This amendment will remove the concession given to textiles and goods for use in the servicing of aircraft. The tariff rate of these textiles will be the conventional rate of duty&mdash;all above 10 per cent. The materials which include generic items such as seat fabrics will be subject to the normal tariff rates that apply to textiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and had effect from 1 April 1995. This is intended to restore the intended level of assistance to blood packs and blood pack systems such that they do not face an immediate removal of the 10 per cent tariff. This amendment is a result of a classification challenge to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As the blood packs industry stands, having operated so far under tariff protection, it would be effectively decimated by the instantaneous and comprehensive removal of tariff assistance. The industry should be allowed to move in consonance with the overall tariff reduction phase-down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 amends the Customs Tariff Act and had effect on 10 May 1995. On 13 December 1994 there was a joint ministerial statement announcing a package of measures that were `aimed at facilitating adjustment by the Australian tobacco industry towards international competitiveness.' These measures were in response to the Industry Commission report No. 39 of June 1994, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobacco growing and manufacturing industries</EMPHASIS>. In this package was the removal of customs duties from tobacco leaf, manufactured tobacco and tobacco products from 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995 instituted amendments to make imported unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco products free of customs duties. This was done in order that our local tobacco growing industry would contract with exposure to international competition. This was desirable in the face of the Industry Commission report. The IC report advised that tobacco products was a moribund industry and had existed in an artificial environment created by the tobacco industry stabilisation scheme and the local leaf contents scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of customs duties from leaf and tobacco products was a concession that the tobacco industry agreed to in return for a contribution from state and Commonwealth governments&mdash;financial assistance and an ad valorem tariff&mdash;and long-term contractual obligations from the cigarette manufacturers. This amendment will increase the duty on imported manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by 10 per cent. The increase in duty on tobacco products is also consonant with the coalition policy of dissuading people from smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 will incorporate excise tariff proposals 1, 2 and 3 of 1995 into the Tariff Act and will enact changes to the excise treatment of condensate and topped crude petroleum. The bill has many provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill removes the rate of excise applicable to beer produced from micro-breweries and U-breweries from indexation. Micro-breweries and U-brews are pre-prepared home brewing kits which allow people to brew their own beer. When this category of beer was made excisable in April 1994 the applicable rate of excise was not intended to be subject to indexation. This section removes the rate of excise of these products from indexation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill raises the rate of excise duly on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by 10 per cent. This rise in excise on tobacco products is confluent with the coalition's health policy in regard to tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the definition of physical characteristics of fuel oil to effectively exclude light fuel oil. Light fuel oil will become excisable at the same rate as diesel fuel oil. This addresses the issue of transport industries using light fuel oil as an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to direct my attention to the aviation amendments. I foreshadow that in the committee stage of this bill we will make a request for amendments to the excise on aviation gasoline in respect of the charge being made on airways services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget, the government increased the duty on aviation gasoline, avgas, by 1.847c per litre, and increased the duty on aviation turbine fuel, avtur, by 0.883c per litre. Avgas is the fuel used in piston engined propeller aircraft, the one most used by the general aviation industry. Avtur is used in jet aircraft and turbine powered propeller aircraft. </PARA>

The avtur duty is much lower because most of the duty on avgas, about 17c a litre, is assigned to Airservices Australia to pay for air traffic services used by avgas powered aircraft. Avtur operators, the jet aircraft, pay for the air traffic services they use through a system of charges&mdash;a user pays approach. Both avgas and avtur users pay the same, 2.451c per litre, for air safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 July, the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA, was divided into two organisations: the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, which is responsible for air safety regulation; and Airservices Australia, which is responsible for managing the air traffic control system and allied systems, such as fire fighting. CASA's 1995-96 budget is $86.3 million, a figure substantially higher than the CAA's aviation safety regulation budget for 1994-95 of $61.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95, the safety regulation duties on the two fuels generated $24.3 million. The 0.883c per litre increase in the duties is forecast to raise an additional $22.5 million, increasing CASA's revenue from the fuel duties to $46.8 million. Approximately $43.5 million, or 93 per cent, of the total would be generated by the duty on the aviation turbine fuel used by jet aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises the need for an increase in CASA's funding to pay for safety. We will not be opposing the increase in the duty on avtur, nor will we be opposing the 0.883c per litre increase in the air safety component of the avgas duty. As I pointed out, however, most of the revenue generated by avgas is allocated to funding airways services used by avgas operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the CAA recommended a 3.4c per litre increase in the airways services component of the duty. That was rejected by the government following a lot of industry concern. The government announced instead that it would increase the component by 0.964c per litre, raising an additional $1.1 million a year. I have indicated that I will be moving a request to reverse this increase in the airways services component of the duty. </PARA>

Most general aviation operators and private pilots use the airways system only rarely but still have to pay thousands of dollars a year in duty. For example, agricultural operators are now paying the government an average of $7,800 per plane per year for services they do not use. If they have converted their aircraft to avtur they do not pay at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

We in the coalition do not believe that there is any justification for increasing the airways component of the avgas duty while the review is being conducted. There is no justification, we believe, at this stage for making the present unfair system even more unfair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The importance that the Australian Democrats attach to these bills may be gauged by my attire tonight. I have some difficulty in understanding why the minister at the table, Senator Schacht, cannot match it because these bills are extremely important. I will now deal with some of the more significant aspects of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 alters the treatment of textiles used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft. Currently, textiles used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft are subject to a concessional rate of duty of only two per cent. The amendment in schedule 1 of the bill will remove the concession available for textiles used in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft. Such materials, which include generic items such as seat fabric, will be subject to the normal tariff regime applying to textiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 of that bill increases the rate of duty on imports of manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by approximately 10 per cent. The Democrats support the use of higher taxes to discourage the consumption of products that are known to have contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 contains a number of amendments. The first changes the definition of fuel oil so that light fuel oils attract the same rate of duty as diesel fuel oil. The second amendment will increase the price of aviation gas by 0.883c per litre on aviation kerosene and by 1.847c per litre on aviation gasoline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the coalition is unhappy about this increase in the price of avgas. It argues that it is inequitable to use fuel duties to recover the cost of providing airways services to general aviation, particularly when some rural operators do not even enter controlled air space. The Democrats certainly believe that there is a point in this argument and have great concern for the costs that are loaded onto people in country areas who are struggling to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has acknowledged the potential problems with such a pricing structure and has stated that new charging arrangements are being considered by Airservices Australia. The government appears to be saying, `Allow us to increase the price of fuel and we'll deal with the distributive effects later.' On balance, however, the Democrats believe that the coalition's view is the better one and we will be supporting their amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the government wishes to ensure that this amendment is not retrospective and that the funds collected so far remain in the government's hands. I certainly would support any amendment which would ensure that the amendment of the coalition does not have retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is also debating Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. Schedule 2 of that bill increases the rate of excise on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by 10 per cent. Consistent with our position on the previous bill, the Democrats will not be opposing this aspect of the bill&mdash;indeed, we welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 mirrors the provision in the previous bill. Item 1 of schedule 3 of the bill changes the definition of fuel oil in the Excise Tariff Act 1921. It changes the definition of fuel oil so that light fuel oils attract the same rate of excise as diesel fuel oil. In addition, schedule 4 proposes to implement changes in the excise treatment of condensate and topped crude petroleum oil-topped crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from a number of sectors in industry, particularly rail transport and some tourism operators, who say they will be hard hit by this redefinition of light fuel oil. But the facts of the matter are that a lot of uses of light fuel oil were only suddenly found to be appropriate when it was found that money could be saved compared with ordinary diesel fuel oil. In many areas it was not the appropriate fuel to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are good and sound arguments for reducing the cost of diesel fuel for some operations, then that should become the subject of exemptions. I can see the minister going pale at that. I know this has been a very live issue for quite some years now. We are only just now moving towards tightening up the regime so that the revenue losses through the diesel fuel excise rebate are not getting out of hand. But that, I believe, is the best way of dealing with it if there is an argument that certain uses in industry should be supported by a reduction in energy costs. With that one exception that I foreshadowed concerning the amendment by the opposition, the Democrats will be supporting these bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, if you listen, you might just find out what the bill is about. The changes in this bill are not just technical reclassifications; they are substantive changes that will incur costs of hundreds of millions of dollars. These changes are simply buried in this tome. If they were presented on their own in a separate bill, we all know they would probably be debated substantially. That will not be, because no-one can cope with ploughing through 950 pages to figure out what is going on and then consult with the community and so on. They would rather preserve the myth that this is just a technical bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that on page 129 of this bill there is an introduction of a definition&mdash;a definition that never existed in the prior acts. It is not obvious. This new definition is not mentioned anywhere. The definition reclassifies diesel fuel oil. It will impose hundreds of millions of dollars of extra cost, mainly on our nation's railroads. Of course, the railroads are owned by the state, mainly the state governments. But do not simply expect this cost to be transferred from state grants back to the Commonwealth as a fuel tax. We all know the cost will be transferred to the users of the railroads, mainly primary industry. It will increase the cost of fuel by about 26c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the explanatory memorandum there is no mention of this change&mdash;a change involving an imposition of hundreds of millions of dollars on wheat farmers and other primary producers. It was not worth a mention. In fact, there is no mention of the chapter it occurs in. Page 9 of the explanatory memorandum goes from chapter 26 to chapter 28.

We have no idea of what the impact of this bill is likely to be. One thing is clear: it goes far beyond simple harmonisation of standards. I could go on about the importance of rail or the impact of fuel oil changes to rural communities; it has been said before. If you want to know more, consult <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I will say a few things about the supposed environmental benefits of this measure the government is trying to sneak through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would like to say that this will do very little to improve the environment. What is being done is to reclassify some fuel oil as industrial diesel. This means that petroleum companies may now sell the same fuel as industrial diesel to all buyers, where before they were selling a higher grade of fuel, and only those who bought fuel oil could get this grade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the evidence of engineers in New South Wales and Western Australian rail services are that railroad engines can be, and have been, designed so that they can use fuel oil more efficiently than industrial diesel oil. They have done particulate testing and emission testing and it runs cleaner. There are engineering efficiencies gained in the way the fuel fires. So for rail applications, currently fuel oil is the cleaner fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on any further, but I will say that this issue and all the other issues in this bill are not being adequately examined or debated. The government should be ashamed of itself for this. It is a shameful thing to undermine the scrutiny of legislation. The coalition should be ashamed of itself for allowing this pile of unscrutinised legislation to slip through the Senate with no justification other than the invocation of the magic words `World Trade Organisation obligation'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in the speeches from the other parties that, in particular, the senators accepted the changes to light fuel oil. I thank the parties for accepting that measure. I have to say that, if it had not been accepted, and the differential between light fuel oil at 6c a litre compared with diesel fuel at 32c a litre had maintained, within two or three years we would have had a massive leakage of revenue probably approaching $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technically, once people go out there explaining how you put certain filters on such things as interstate diesel trucks&mdash;that you could use diesel at 6c a litre&mdash;everyone will swap over. As of four or five months ago, one of the major oil companies was preparing a major marketing campaign to convince people to swap to light fuel oil, which they would produce, and to explain to people with diesel engines how you put the filters on so you could use it. We would have ended up with, as I say, an estimated $1 billion of lost revenue, which would have meant a significant change in taxation somewhere else to make up for the lost revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the fact that it appears that the other parties will support the government on this measure. I accept the fact that there will be some momentary agitation and irritation in a couple of areas. People have, over the last year or so, moved to using light fuel oil such as some tourist boats in North Queensland, but that has only been in the last year or so. They will have to pay more than what they were expecting. I am told that some of their marketing and costs of tickets on their boats have been set to cover the cost of running the whole service at 6c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also accept the fact that railways in Australia were overwhelmingly the ones who moved into using light fuel oil. Their complaint is that they had not been eligible for the diesel fuel rebate even though they run on their own rail tracks and so on and that this itself was probably costing $100 million already in lost revenue. The railways will complain, I should imagine. They have not complained as much&mdash;I am not trying to encourage them either&mdash;as some of the operators. I will not go through all the other measures. They were all outlined in the second reading speech. I thank the Senate for its support. Do we have the amendment?</PARA>

There is an implication in terms of the price of fuels that are now going to be defined as something else. Whilst it may be true that excise has not changed on those fuels, the fact that a fuel that used to be defined as one thing is now defined as something else means that, in effect, the people using those fuels will have a different rate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition initially had a request for an amendment to the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. The reason for that was explained in the second reading debate and was also referred to by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht). The reason for this request was that it was felt it was unfair, inequitable and unjust to require the general aviation industry, which uses avgas, to pay Airservices Australia type charges when, in the main, they did not use them. We have before us two bills which require two amendments. The one I am addressing now is the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill and the one that will come later with a very similar amendment is the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the two amendments is that where there is an increase in excise on locally produced avgas, there has been an amendment to the charge. In some places, notably the Northern Territory, avgas is imported from places like Singapore and there has to be an equivalent increase in the customs tariff. They equal one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I initially circulated an amendment in my name, which has now been amended, to the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill, which reflects the proposal put to the opposition and the Democrats by the minister. The proposal put was that the government would agree to our amendment&mdash;in other words, to reduce the tariff on avgas so that the general aviation industry using aviation gasoline would not be required to make that contribution to Airservices Australia type charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of that arrangement between the minister and the opposition, the government will now agree to that amendment, provided it applies from tomorrow. So the amendment circulated in my name still contains the same figures in respect of the avgas tariff but is applicable from 28 November, which means there will be a reduction as from tomorrow. The minister has put this to us on the basis that this tariff has been collected since 1 July. The logistics of paying back some of those charges are such that it would be cleaner if the amendments proposed by the opposition and supported by the Democrats applied from tomorrow. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two bills contain the main budget measures, but there a number of non-budget measures to be dealt with also. The bills are long and complex and range over many issues. In a cognate debate it is quite frankly not possible to cover all the issues. This raises concern about the way in which these bills have been handled and the complexity that becomes apparent day by day in relation to social security law. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law contained in these bills is complex. It adds to legislation that is already exceedingly complex and the government does not help itself by providing inadequate time for consideration of bills of this sort. Almost weekly one sees comments from independent observers, such as the ombudsman and the Auditor-General, about the complexity of social security legislation. The Welfare Rights Movement has also put on record over a long period its concern about the complexity of the social security system. Therefore, if we as legislators have difficulty in getting on top of this legislation what hope has the man on the street of keeping up with and understanding changes to social security legislation. </PARA>

I am quite certain she will say she is observing copious notes. You and I both know that in fact she is reading every single word that has been written by her research officer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues which I would like to address in relation to this bill. These include carer's pension, rent assistance, waiver of debts and the guardian allowance. The major issue, however, relates to data matching. On behalf of the coalition I will be moving an amendment relating to the data matching amendments in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data matching is an issue which the coalition, and Senator Patterson in particular, has kept under close scrutiny since it was first introduced. At that time there were wildly unrealistic estimates of millions of dollars in savings and huge increases in efficiency. Neither of these predictions have actually eventuated. Despite the government's attempts to claim otherwise, the data matching system has not lived up to expectations. It has not delivered the huge savings it promised and it continues to pose a real threat to the privacy of Australians in general. We must be vigilant to keep it under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 contains a number of amendments to the current data matching program. It proposes to extend the data matching program to cover the child-care assistance payment. While the coalition is not opposing this measure, we are very concerned about the insidious extension of data matching. In this case, data matching is being extended into yet another portfolio, Health, which jointly administers, with the Department of Social Security, the child-care assistance payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the proposal to remove the sunset clause for data matching. The coalition will be proposing an amendment which will extend the sunset clause for data matching until January 1999, effectively for another three years. The government has proposed changing the reporting requirements for the Data-matching Agency. These amendments would mean that the agency would have to provide a comprehensive report to parliament only every three years rather than the current requirement of reporting annually. The coalition will be opposing this amendment. As I have already mentioned, the coalition is very concerned about protecting the privacy of individuals. To ensure this, the agency must remain accountable to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the bill will authorise the provision of the date of the person's most recent tax assessment to the Data-matching Agency. We will in fact be proposing an amendment to the effect that the operation of data matching will be extended for a further three years to January 1999, but we certainly want to ensure that the efficacy of the process is something that is still tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments have been put forward in relation to departure certificates. Presently, the act provides that a person's qualification for a pension ends if they leave Australia without a departure certificate and stay overseas for more than six months. This amendment will provide that if a person leaves the country without a departure certificate, after six months their pension will be suspended rather than cancelled and will only be cancelled after 12 months. It also provides that in special circumstances the secretary has the discretion to restore a pension with full arrears up to two years from the date of departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment has been made in response to the Commonwealth Ombudsman annual report, which commented that about 1,200 pensioners per year had their pensions cancelled this way. The report also mentioned the problems that arise when pensioners go overseas intending to stay for less than six months and are unable to return because of illness or medical treatment. They could face losing their pensions permanently and then lose their major means of paying for medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget the government announced that the guardian allowance would be increased by $4 a fortnight as of September next year. That is $2 a week for the people who are seen to be the most needy and the most vulnerable in our community. This has been identified particularly by ACOSS. What does this government do? It acknowledges that this is a problem, that there is a need that ought to be addressed, but it delays the introduction of the measure by 16 months, to the budget after next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why such a small increase? After all, ACOSS has identified that there has not been a real increase in the allowance since 1986 and that, in fact, since 1973 the real value of the allowance has dropped by 48 per cent. This increase has left the payment $10 per week short of the amount needed to meet the benchmark of 10 per cent of the married pension rate. The government has acknowledged this problem, but is responding in a most inadequate way to a group of people who are really in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also amendments relating to rent assistance. Rent assistance is to be increased by $5 per fortnight for families with children; however, the rent assistance threshold is to be increased by $5 per fortnight at the same time. The end result is that the government is pretending to be generous in handing out an increase when in fact some recipients have to pay an additional $5 in rent before being eligible for rent assistance. In addition, the rent assistance entitlements of certain recipients which had been preserved under the act, including some boarders and lodgers, certain residents of retirement villages and recipients of rent assistance, will not be frozen until they are in line with all other rent assistance recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will bring about a saving to the government of around $16.9 million over 3 1/4 years. That is a saving of $5 million a year for the needy. This highlights the hypocrisy of the government. Admittedly, the 190,000 families will receive up to $5 a fortnight. However, the government has estimated that 310,000 recipients will lose up to $3.75 as a result of the increase in the threshold, 8,700 recipients will lose entitlements to rent assistance as a result of the increase in the threshold and 556,100 recipients not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill being debated as part of this package of bills is the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. This bill also gives effect to a number of measures announced in the government's 1995-96 budget. Again, these measures were announced in May and here we are some six months later and they are being rushed through in the final days of the sitting. The legislation amends the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the National Health Act 1953, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Child Care Rebate Act 1982 and the Disability Services Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill contains another 230 pages of changes to the social security legislation. It contains 17 schedules, which propose a wide range of measures. Many of those measures are particularly significant. I wish to focus on the most important ones tonight in the interests of time. One of those is the question of extended deeming. The main issue in the social security and veterans' affairs bill is the introduction of a new extended deeming regime and the resulting repeal of the unrealised capital gains provision which treats as income any gain on shares and other investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has long pledged to repeal the unfair unrealised capital gains provision and the government has been criticised by all sections of the community for the unfair nature of the unrealised capital gains provision. It created uncertainty amongst the pensioner population and was a complex and inequitable system of assessing income. For many it became impossible to plan ahead as their pensions could reduce significantly four times each year. The government did not receive the revenue it expected from the treatment of capital gains as income for social security and the extended deeming introduces a new system of calculating income from financial investments. Initially, a standard deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of financial investments for single people and to the first $50,000 for couples. Above these a standard deeming rate of seven per cent will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued that the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty and they are comparatively simple. The problem is that the government has made no provision in the bill to determine how often a person's financial assets are to be valued. At present people are required to notify the department each time the value of their assets change and their pensions will be adjusted accordingly. There is a penalty involved if a person fails to advise the department of a change which leads to a debt due. This matter was referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which considered the issue of appropriate timing and regularity of valuation, and reported to the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports a simplified and more equitable valuation of assets, it believes that the timing of the valuation of financial investments should be incorporated in the bill. This system of timing of valuation must not only be administratively simple and workable, it should also place minimum demands on the clients of the Department of Social Security who will be affected by extended deeming. To that end, I foreshadow that I shall move an amendment to ensure that valuation of financial assets takes place at six-monthly intervals with the option of the client being able to seek a valuation at any time during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system of extended deeming has been lauded by the government as being advantageous to pensioners and other social security recipients, but it needs to be pointed out that the government itself estimates that it will result in savings of $62.58 million in 1996-97 and $65.02 million in 1997-98. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system of extended deeming has been lauded, as I said, by the government, but there are problems&mdash;in addition to those I have already mentioned&mdash;in that the government has also estimated that 270,000 pensioners and part pensioners will see a decrease in their pensions if they do not rearrange their assets. Pensioners or part pensioners who lose their pension will also lose their fringe benefit entitlements arising from concession cards. The government estimates that 120,000 people will see an increase in their pension, but this increase will on average be $4 per week. Regardless of how the government attempts to simplify the system, it needs to be clear that it remains Labor's income and assets test in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed in this bill to assist investors of the Estate Mortgage trusts who have been adversely affected by the unrealised capital gains provisions. The trust collapsed in 1990, and investors lost a considerable amount of money at the time. The trust has now been relisted as the Meridian Investment Trust and, since that time, investments have increased considerably. However, the gains have not been sufficient to make up for the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investments in the original trust were exempt from the unrealised capital gains rules as they were classified as a saved investment. When the trust was relisted, they were no longer exempt, and the total gain since that time has been assessed under the income test. This is causing a reduction in investors' pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition indicated last week that it would be proposing amendments in the committee stage to treat Meridian Investments as saved investments until July 1996. We heard today that the government intends to give people an ex gratia payment, but it is not going to put those people into the position they would have been in if these were saved investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, considerable representations have been made to members and senators from the umbrella friendly society organisation, the Australian Friendly Societies Association. The organisation has asserted that provision should be made to treat tax prepaid investments, such as friendly society bonds, differently to products on which tax is not prepaid but where the investors pay tax at their own marginal tax rate. The association argues that returns from prepaid tax products will necessarily be lower than those available to non-prepaid tax investments, as the tax has been paid prior to distribution to the investor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Friendly Societies Association has argued that they will be unfairly prejudiced under the new rules as they do not have the ability to deliver returns equal to or more than the deeming rates of five per cent or seven per cent. A majority of friendly society members and associations are located in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Friendly Societies Association has made alternative suggestions to solve one of the problems to do with pension investments. Two suggestions have been made: firstly, introduce a differential deeming rate for pre-tax paid investments which would take account of the fact that the tax has been paid prior to distribution to the investor; and, secondly, amend division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable friendly societies to provide income stream products, which pensioners may switch to without tax penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee on community affairs held an inquiry to assess the merits of the representations of the friendly societies and assess whether the deeming rules should be changed, whether the tax legislation should be amended or whether no changes should be made. In its report, the community affairs committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has considered these arguments (from the Friendly Societies) but considers that extended deeming has considerable benefits and that organisations claiming to be affected by the proposed changes need to develop more attractive products; and that consumers have a responsibility to seek the best possible return for their capital.</PARA>
<PARA>There are other measures in this bill which should be discussed at greater length&mdash;for example, changes to the earnings credit scheme and the mature age allowance, and the amalgamation of the jobsearch and newstart allowance schemes. However, the government is ramming these measures through at such a rate before the end of the session that time does not allow for debate at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third bill being debated cognately tonight is the Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995. My colleague Senator Tierney will also be speaking on this bill, so I will only give an outline of it at this stage. The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. This bill would make machinery changes arising from changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to CES notification requirements and allow the ESRA to obtain goods and services by using a credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill would allow for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the CES is required to send out two notices to people under case management. The first letter notifies people that they have begun participating in the case management system. These people may have to wait for months before they actually meet their case manager. They receive another notice when they are referred to a case manager. Under this present system the government can inflate immediately the number of people in case management, by totalling the number of letters initially sent out even though large numbers of these people had not even met their case managers, and those who are actually consulting with case managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest constraints this system faces is that there are many more people in case management than there are case managers to handle them. The coalition has long been concerned that the number of clients per case manager is sometimes ridiculously high. There have been reported instances of case managers servicing up to 200 clients each. Clients cannot possibly expect an adequate level of attention or advice when they are competing for their case manager's attention with so many other people. The recent Auditor-General's report No. 3 into CES case management revealed very serious weaknesses in the functioning of the CES which it said must be `very quickly' remedied `as they reduce its capacity to assist the long-term unemployed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also makes provision for the ESRA to purchase goods and services on a credit card. The coalition will monitor closely the way in which this ESRA credit card is used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill relates also to job compact eligibility for certain seasonal and part-time workers. The definition of persons eligible for the job compact is amended to include the requirement that, in addition to having been in receipt of the jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance or the youth training allowance for a period of 18 months, a person must have been registered with the CES for a period of 18 months. This is apparently to take account of persons who may have had their CES registration date reset to zero. When seasonal and part-time workers elect not to participate in case management, the period of 18 months registration required to be eligible under the proposed amendments would be taken to commence for seasonal workers from the time of that election and for part-time workers after they have completed at least 13 weeks of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new subsection will be added to provide that a person's CES registration will be added to provide that a person's CES registration is reset to zero by deeming that the person has ceased to be registered on the day specified in the determination under section 39(14) and to have recommenced registration on the following day. A new subsection 39(16) will be added to make it clear that CES registration means being registered by the CES as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing this bill but notes that this government has failed to adequately address the massive unemployment problem still faced by this country.

The issues I would like to concentrate on tonight are valuation and extended deeming. They were the two issues that were referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for us to investigate. We had some hearings a week ago. It is important for people to remember that both these issues affect all social security recipients and not just those who are age pensioners. I think a number of the people who made submissions to our committee of inquiry obviously had forgotten that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of valuation of assets, I understand that the department does have a preference for six months. That certainly was the impression we gained from the inquiry, but a lot of other organisations who would have a keen interest in this appeared not to have given this a great deal of thought. The department is undertaking additional consultations on this matter and has worked out a number of alternatives and options that are available. For that it is to be commended. It has looked carefully into this issue. Importantly, under the six-month valuation the recipient has the opportunity to go, if there is a major change in the value of their product, to Social Security and seek an earlier revaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that got a lot of attention was the extended deeming provision. It is important to state very clearly that deeming is not new in the area of social security benefit. It has certainly been around for some time with bank accounts. Initially, it was thought of and spoken about as being the end of Western civilisation as we knew it. However, it has turned out to be a very beneficial product, a very beneficial way of assessing income because it has enabled people to have certainty and to make an investment choice so that their investment can be put away and left in a vehicle that will give them a reasonable return and they do not have to worry about fluctuations&mdash;it is just taken care of by the deeming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means that if they are earning over and above the deeming rate they are able to say that that is money for jam and it is beneficial. The deeming rate, of course, has not been set at a high level. I have seen some comments in the media that it has been set at a high level to encourage risky investment. That is not the case, it has not proved to be the case to date and it will not be the case in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are encouraging pensioners and, in particular, aged people to make investments to provide, as best they are able, for their retirement. The pension is seen to supplement their income or, if they are only on a small investment, they are able to supplement their pension. It is very important for pensioners to be aware that supplementing their incomes leaves them financially better off; it leaves them in a financially superior position because it gives them more disposable income to live on. We will not go the way of trying to reduce their income levels from outside sources and trying to live solely on the age pension. More and more people are having superannuation investments and having small amounts of money, which are getting larger, to invest to assist them in their old age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we get the pensioners and the older people to carefully think about and assess the sort of product that will suit them best as they get older. It should not be construed from anything that has been said here tonight that age pensions will disappear, because they certainly will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extending the deeming enables simplicity and transparency, the two key things that pensioner groups and older retirees keep asking for&mdash;they want something that is simple and transparent. That is what we have in this provision. There is a guaranteed deeming rate of five per cent up to $30,000 for single people, up to $50,000 for couples and for amounts above that the deeming rate is seven per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that if elderly people are making investment decisions they make them in a considered and wise manner. Sometimes one wonders how wisely people have made decisions&mdash;they might get a bit concerned and a bit scared. Deeming is not a new issue. The issue of income for elderly people is one that has been around for a while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This community affairs committee also undertook an inquiry into the treatment of pensions and shares. A variation on deeming was one of the options that came out of that committee inquiry in August 1993. Following that, John Barber undertook a consultation process in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Targeting for equity</EMPHASIS> which was published in December 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that people remember that this work has been going on for some time. The thing that kept coming out of the consultations from that strategic review of income and assets test was that there were over 6,000 submissions to that consultation and review. Without a doubt the things that kept coming through in all of those issues were simplicity and stability, minimal intrusion and minimal impact on investment choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the extension of deeming allows. It is also what setting down a set period for valuation will allow. People will be able to plan ahead. People will be able to make assessments and know that, if that is their amount of income or that is the amount they have to invest, they are going to have this return on that and this is what the effect is going to be on their age pension. It is very important that people recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The friendly societies certainly appeared before us. For pensioners who have significant amounts of income and who are paying higher marginal tax rates, those investments are quite good. In fact I would say that they are very good. They are secure. They also have the tax taken out. For some people that would in fact give them a bit of a tax break. For the 70-odd per cent of pensioners who do not pay any income tax, these products are not the best products for them. It is vitally important that people look at what the best products for them are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if deeming is something new. It was announced in the May budget. It is not going to be implemented until July next year. This will certainly allow a number of organisations time to alter or to amend the product they are able to offer as well to people. I think it is vitally important that we remember these particular points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telling thing that came out of the inquiry, to me, was the plea and the urging by the pensioner and aged persons organisations that we not halt or slow up the deliberation on this bill and that we not amend it in any way. The APSF say that they believe `the message of the extended deeming system is that pensioners should make investment decisions on the performance of that investment&mdash;not on their favourable treatment under Social Security rules'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also go on to talk about reminding `the Senate committee that every single pensioner or retiree organisation across the country that took part in the strategic review of the income and assets test review has enthusiastically welcomed the extended deeming changes because they are simpler, fairer, offer more predicability, increase incentives for self-provision and simplify the choice of investment options for older people'. Those are the sorts of comments that we kept getting&mdash;that we would not delay this legislation in any way; that we would get it enacted as quickly as possible, because they all could see that this was a bill that was actually going to enable them to have simplicity, surety and stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Financial Planning Association urged the Senate committee not to succumb to special pleading for any extension of deeming. They said that `for any extended deeming to work fairly and equitably there must be no exceptions among financial institutions'. That is very important. Of course the Financial Planning Association actually represents those bodies and those people who are involved in advising people how to plan their money. Those people are probably talking themselves out of business, but it is important that the aged people of this country get a product that is simple and get something they understand. It is with much pleasure that I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. As Senator Knowles said, this is an incredible amount of legislation to be trying to deal with at this time of the year, but we will do our best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking firstly at the carer bill, overall the Australian Democrats support the thrust of this bill. We believe, however, that in a number of areas the reforms proposed could have, and certainly should have, gone further. For example, the departure certificate changes proposed in this bill are a great step forward. The operation of the current provisions has been criticised as being overly harsh by a number of groups and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman's attention was drawn to this issue by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which referred on 17 cases where the AAT was compelled to follow the legislation and decide in the department's favour but was concerned about the fairness of some of the decisions. I am sure you will agree that that is quite a significant step for the AAT to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the concerns raised, the bill will require the department, if the department becomes aware of the fact that a pensioner has left Australia without a departure certificate, to send a notice to the person informing them of their obligations. The bill will also provide the Secretary to the Department of Social Security with greater discretion to exempt a person, where their circumstances warrant it, from losing their payment for failing to satisfy the departure certificate requirements: for example, if they should become ill while overseas. These decisions, however, will not be open to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is appropriate that the exercise of this discretion should be subject to review. As a matter of fact, all decisions of this nature should be subject to review. I will be moving an amendment at the committee stage to ensure that decisions made under the new section, 1218A, can be reviewed by authorised review officers, by the SSAT and by the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also make changes to the operation of the data-matching program. I do not think anyone in this place needs to be reminded that the Democrats oppose the introduction of the data-matching program&mdash;we have opposed it all along&mdash;and the use of the extended tax file number. In fact, we remain horrified by these measures. I certainly remember speeches made by my colleague Senator Meg Lees in this debate placing on the record our opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We oppose the data-matching program on two grounds: firstly, that the savings it was claimed would be achieved through the program were wildly exaggerated&mdash;I underline `wildly'&mdash;and, secondly, that the program presented major privacy concerns. In response to those privacy concerns, the Senate imposed a requirement that all data-matching agencies submit an annual report to parliament which includes reference to guidelines issued by the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill now seeks to replace that requirement for annual reporting to parliament with the requirement that such reports be provided only every three years. Why bother? If you are going to report every three years, then obviously there is no intention to take that requirement seriously. You will not be surprised when I say that the Democrats will be opposing this move, as we still believe that it is important for the parliament to maintain a reasonable level of scrutiny over the operation of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the waiver of a debt where that debt is attributable `solely to an administrative error'. Firstly, the Welfare Rights Centre has argued that debts often result from a range of complex circumstances, and as such this term is too narrow and should be replaced with `the dominant cause of which can be attributed to administrative error'. I will pursue this at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Welfare Rights has suggested that the new provisions may not be available where assurance of support payments has been made, since the person who incurs the debt is not the one who receives the payments. I understand that the government has provided Welfare Rights with an undertaking to address this issue. I welcome that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the changes announced in the budget and contained within this legislation that will increase the maximum amount of rent assistance available to families and will increase the lowest threshold above which rent assistance becomes payable. It is estimated that around 191,000 families will benefit from the $5 a fortnight increase in rent assistance with a cost to government of around $26 million per year. At the same time, however, ACOSS estimates that nearly 365,000 households will be worse off as a result of the $5 increase in the rent assistance threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that increasing the threshold by $5 per fortnight `will reduce outlays and improve the targeting of rent assistance by reducing levels of assistance to customers who pay low or moderate rents'. The effect of this so-called better targeting will be that rent assistance recipients will lose a total of around $30 million per year. An amount of $7 million will be taken from aged pensioners&mdash;just think of that, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;who, ACOSS expects, will be mostly elderly single women, my mother included. Disability support pensioners will lose $5.5 million. The unemployed will lose $10 million, the worst affected likely to be single young people. And $7 million will be taken from additional family payment recipients&mdash;that is, sole parent and low income families who are in the greatest need. The Democrats will be opposing the raising of the rent assistance threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say that the two changes proposed in this bill to the operation of rent assistance seem to exemplify the pattern of changes in the Social Security portfolio: any winners from policy changes gain at the expense of other Social Security clients. Talk about bad news-good news stories&mdash;this must be the ultimate. In this case, to quote ACOSS:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rent Assistance increases to families with children will be paid for by single people, couples without children, and by families with the lowest incomes&mdash;that is, by those people who make up a high proportion of the most marginalised groups in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>They will be paid for, and the government will also make a windfall of around $6 million per year. So much for their generosity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue from this bill that I want to discuss is the $2 a week increase in the guardian allowance, which will not take effect until September next year. I think all parties will have received a submission from ACOSS in which it points out, firstly, the gross inadequacy of this increase and, secondly, the inequity of the September 1996 starting date, particularly in light of the fact that the new maternity allowance, available to those with incomes up to $61,000 per year, will commence in February 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACOSS has pointed out that the real value of the guardian allowance has dropped by a massive 48 per cent since 1973 and that there has been no real increase in payments since 1986. In particular, in the early 1990s, the allowance was paid at a rate equal to 22 per cent of the married pension. Since that time, the allowance has plummeted in value to the point where it is currently just 5.5 per cent of the married pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACOSS and the Social Policy Research Centre have stated a view that the appropriate benchmark for the allowance is 10 per cent of the married pension and, to achieve this, ACOSS was pursuing a $12 a week increase in the payment for this year's budget. Instead of $12 a week, of course, the government has granted just $2 a week. For all the reasons I have just given, it can be seen that this increase is quite inadequate and to delay the increase until the end of next year simply adds insult to injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, as the name of this particular bill indicates, there is a package of measures for carers. The first of those measures will provide that a recipient of the carer pension will continue to receive their payment for 14 weeks after the person they have been caring for is permanently institutionalised. This will allow the person some time to adjust to their new circumstances. One of those new circumstances is that they will have to transfer to a new social security payment. In the majority of cases that will mean the loss of some income and, more importantly, the loss of their pensioner concession card. Having run a campaign for thousands of widows who are in this situation, I am well aware of the significant loss which this indicates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all of us in this place are aware of how highly pensioners value their concession card. I believe that the government should be looking to provide the concession card to these people for six or even 12 months after coming off the carer pension. In fact, I believe they ought to continue it indefinitely until that person's circumstances have changed significantly enough for them to lose that concession card. But 14 weeks is simply not long enough for them to be able to adjust completely to their changed circumstances. While the concession card is not the total answer to this, it would certainly be greatly appreciated by these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Turning now to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, there are a couple of issues from this bill that I want to touch on. The first is the proposed changes to the operation of the earnings credit scheme, which is currently available to those unemployed people who are receiving a jobsearch or newstart allowance. The earnings credit scheme allows unemployed people to earn a very limited amount of outside income without affecting their social security payments. The scheme is a very valuable initiative: it allows people to accept work opportunities which they otherwise may have knocked back for fear of losing their social security payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if we make the restrictions on the scheme as tight as this bill seeks to do, people simply will not take advantage of it. Just recently a friend of mine, who has a PhD and who sought higher qualifications because he was encouraged to do so by government policy, was telling me that he has been unable to get full-time work. He took four weeks part-time work recommended to him by the CES but found at the end of the four weeks that he had lost a significant amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, the earnings credit scheme is meant to encourage people to find work and to get into the work force so that they can get back self-esteem and in that way become full-time and permanent workers. If we are going to make this scheme so restrictive that people will not take advantage of it, then we are simply, as they say, cutting off our noses to spite our faces. The Democrats will be opposing that part of the bill which seeks to limit to $100 the amount of earnings credit which can be used in any one fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I want to comment on tonight relates to the changes proposed to the mature age allowance. The mature age allowance was introduced as an interim measure to assist older long-term unemployed people. It is now proposed to make the allowance a permanent part of the social security system. Of course, the main reason for there being an ever increasing need for the mature age allowance is as a result of the government and opposition decision to increase the pension age for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many older women are now finding themselves in the very difficult position of not qualifying for the pension but having very little hope of finding work. I might underline that in a soon to be tabled report of the super committee, we received a lot of evidence on this very issue. All of the evidence underlined the fact that it was a significant disadvantage for women to have this imposition on them. Indeed, I predict that the soon to be tabled super committee report&mdash;a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super and broken work patterns</EMPHASIS>&mdash;will prove the point that the Democrats and some others in this place have been making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the increased pension age for women is going ahead, however, the Democrats believe that the extension of the mature age allowance is the least that can be done. The Democrats, however, are strongly opposed to the idea that new grants of the allowance after 1 July next year will be made under the benefit income and assets tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just explain about these nasties. We believe that these are nothing more than a cost cutting exercise. As senators will be aware, the benefit income and assets tests are much tighter than the pension tests. For example, while both assets tests allow single persons to hold assets up to $118,000, after this amount the pension phases out gradually but benefits cut out immediately. In other words, for benefits, the $118,000 is a sudden death limit. Single people with assets between $118,000 and $231,750 would qualify for some mature age allowance under the old test but will not qualify under the new test&mdash;and neither will they qualify for the unemployment payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical effect of this will be that people will be forced to run their assets down at the very time we should be encouraging them to maintain their assets for retirement. Minister, this is a crazy proposition&mdash;just crazy stuff. I cannot understand it. Why should the government even be considering such a proposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as the welfare rights people have pointed out, this change will also lead to greater complexity within the social security system as you will have two categories of mature age allowance recipients: those who applied before 1 July 1996 and who are subject to the pensions income and assets test; and those who applied after that date who are paid under the allowance income and assets test. I am aware that the coalition will be supporting these changes. So I simply state for the record the Democrats' opposition to the imposition of the benefit income and assets test to the mature age allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak with reference to the Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995, which was spoken to earlier by my colleague Senator Knowles. This bill changes case management arrangements for some part-time and seasonal workers. It also streamlines the administrative procedures for CES case management and allows ESRA to obtain goods and services on a credit card. It amalgamates the jobsearch and newstart allowance as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing this bill but there are several pertinent comments that I wish to make with regard to it. Firstly, I would like to look at case management. The coalition has had concerns with the case management system; most noticeably the high number of clients per case manager which must preclude adequate attention being given to individual clients. The recent Auditor-General's report No. 3 into CES case management revealed very serious weaknesses in the functioning of the CES which, it said, `must be very quickly remedied as they reduce its capacity to assist the long-term unemployed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was evident from this report that many unemployed people had very tenuous links with their case manager or are not receiving effective assistance at all. Indeed, I met a lady in Tasmania on Saturday who after two years is still waiting to meet her case manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey results were critical in their assessment of the CES case management system. It was found that 30 per cent of clients did not recognise that they had a return to work plan&mdash;a key element of case management. Surely, if this government is failing to get across information about a key element of the Working Nation program to a large proportion of the participants, there is something wrong with the emphasis of the scheme. Twenty-nine per cent of clients had not been asked for feedback about the usefulness of elements of their return to work plan in finding them employment. Again, neglecting to get information and failing to inform clients of a key element of the program begs the question: how serious is the minister about the duties of his department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 43 per cent of clients in employment or studying at the time of the survey indicated that they had received post-placement support&mdash;and this support is supposed to help clients in their transition to employment or study. Given that the people who are receiving case management are the long-term unemployed, you would think that this ought to be the group who are receiving 100 per cent support in transition. Coming back into the work force after a two-year or more gap&mdash;possibly after retraining&mdash;would entail an enormous amount of readjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most damning findings in the Auditor-General's report was the suggestion that, while most clients were satisfied with the length and type of contact, 30 per cent&mdash;almost one-third&mdash;of clients who had visits or personal contact did not believe that contact with the CES was useful. For such a large minority to be unhappy with this system indicates that there are some serious problems. This negative perception by clients is an indictment of the efficacy of the whole program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes provision for ESRA to purchase goods and services on a credit card. I reiterate the concerns expressed by Dr Kemp in the other place regarding the provision of this credit card to the chair of ESRA, who is presently Mrs Joan Kirner, the former Premier of Victoria. Last week in the other place Mr Peter Costello revealed in an answer to a question on notice that Mrs Kirner used her position as the chair of ESRA to fly to Perth for a board meeting which surprisingly coincided with the appearance of her federal colleague, Dr Carmen Lawrence, at the Marks royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in Perth, Mrs Kirner not only attended the Marks royal commission but addressed a Labor women's forum where she called on the audience to `stand shoulder to shoulder with Carmen Lawrence as she takes the witness stand'. On one of the four evenings she spent in Perth Mrs Kirner was also interviewed by Paul Lyneham on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, where she defended Dr Lawrence&mdash;all this in a four-day visit to Perth for the purpose of conducting ESRA business. Needless to say, given this highly questionable use of taxpayers' money in her capacity as chair of ESRA, the coalition will continue to monitor closely the way in which the ESRA credit card is used. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also makes provision for CES registration for seasonal and part-time workers who choose not to remain in case management. This issue of case management flexibility was highlighted in the recent report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into long-term unemployment. Recommendation No. 1 of that report stated:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to continue a series of speeches on the disastrous state facing this nation and the impact that long-term unemployment is having on Australia. It is very timely that I do this in light of Senator Troeth's comments in that recent debate. In some ways what I am saying may seem like a continuation of her comments relating to some of the failures of Working Nation. I want to focus on this tonight, because our Senate committee held hearings right across Australia over a three-month period and scrutinised exactly how the so-called Working Nation program was working&mdash;or, to be more precise, how it was not working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the matters of public interest debate last week I focused on evidence given to the committee that highlighted the voice of despair of the long-term unemployed&mdash;people who felt abandoned by this government and the system that has been set up by its Department of Employment, Education and Training; mature aged people who felt that they were only qualified now to be on the scrap heap of life; youth who were giving up and slipping between the cracks in our society; children who were living in families where no-one was working&mdash;and the health effects on the long-term unemployed and their families, particularly their children, who, as I outlined last week, were beset with a greater amount of chronic illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to focus on the stark evidence that reveals how this so-called ALP Working Nation program is not working. The program was set up to solve the problems of the long-term unemployed, and the evidence we gathered around the country showed again and again across the regions of Australia how it was not working. The government is creating a situation where the long-term unemployed are becoming increasingly entrenched as part of the Australian landscape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government likes to talk about its so-called Working Nation program in dollar terms. It will boast that it has spent $2.2 billion on Working Nation. However, when all the rhetoric is laid aside, the government cannot escape the simple disgraceful fact that 8.7 per cent of the Australian work force remains on the official unemployment list. That does not include the unofficial list of people who have just given up or who are underemployed. Even on the government's own shonky figures, there are still 760,000 Australians without work. Of that number, one-third are long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's recent document on labour market programs, Shaping our Nation, boasts that Australia is leading the OECD nations in the generation of new jobs. This is just a nonsense claim. The incidence of long-term unemployment in the country is near 30 per cent, and this was much worse than comparable OECD countries. By comparison, in Japan it is 15 per cent and in the US it is 12 per cent. So the Keating government's claim that Working Nation programs are having a significant impact is just not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence provided to our committee showed the scale and the dimension of the long-term unemployment problem&mdash;the striking increases in long-term unemployment from 4.5 per cent in the mid-1970s to almost 40 per cent in 1993 at the height of the recession. The main victims of long-term unemployment are the young and the mature aged. Our Senate committee did a major study on youth unemployment two years ago, which to this government's great shame it virtually ignored. In this recent report on long-term unemployment we focused on the mature aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth unemployment that they ignored is still rife in our society. In parts of regional New South Wales it has reached 38 per cent and in the Hunter it is rising to 50 per cent on the far north coast. The long-term unemployment report says that over half&mdash;56 per cent&mdash;of unemployed males over 55 years were unemployed for 52 weeks or more, as were 53 per cent of males aged 45 to 54. The mature aged are unwanted and unhelped by Labor's so-called world-class labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we moved around the country and as we heard from these people, as they came before us and told us their story, not only of losing their jobs but of the total frustration and demoralisation that occurred when they tried to access this Labor government's labour market programs, it showed the stark reality of the failure of Working Nation to us. We found this particularly in regional areas, where this government does not seem to have made enough leeway for the regional differences in the programs that might work in some regions and not in others. At page 58 of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had aggregate national figures showing economic growth that was regarded as too high for some, so as a very blunt instrument, interest rates was used to dampen demand. . . That might be fine in parts of Queensland and Western Australia, where growth was up to 11 per cent. But in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide, for example, we still have a regional recession.</PARA>
<PARA>It is this lack of flexibility in the Labor government's programs that shows how regional Australia misses out. The focus is not on what is needed in those areas. The dimensions of the long-term unemployment problem present a massive task to put everyone back to work. We heard evidence that, with a million unemployed, to get everyone back to work we will have to create the equivalent of 20 entire BHPs or 50,000 to 100,000 small businesses Australia-wide. That is the scope of what we are facing. To have the government coming up with a program that creates training that does not lead to work and where dole queues are constantly churned is not the answer to put people into long-term work. The scale of what is required to create new employment to absorb these people is shown by the figures I indicated in the numbers of small businesses and big businesses needed to take up this sort of slack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation is a cover-up to hide the dimensions of long-term unemployment in this country. It brings together the numbers of people on long-term unemployment training schemes and those with short-term subsidised jobs and places in the them in the same category as those who have gained unsubsidised employment. This is dishonest, skews the outcome of a Working Nation initiative and shows what a cover-up it is when they do those sorts of combinations. I reject as dishonest the notion that the placement of long-term unemployed in subsidised work or formal training justifies their removal from the official unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we moved around the country we found a number of other major criticisms. One of the main ones focused on training that was not leading anywhere. In Whyalla people are sick and tired of training for the sake of it, they told us. They are disillusioned with training programs that get them nowhere. There was a report of the mismatch between jobs and talent. Training in the absence of real jobs is pointless, and evidence on page 80 of the report underlines this. Too often there is a mismatch between the training offered, which must be accepted or benefits are forfeited, and the talents and abilities of the long-term unemployed and the local employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training is often used just as a time filler in some regional areas and to reduce the unemployment statistics. The perception of many older long-term unemployed in regional areas with high structural unemployment is that no amount of training will make a difference and that these DEET programs are indeed time fillers. We have evidence of the churning of the dole queue in this situation. The unemployed and the professionals in the labour market program delivery express the view that labour market programs are merely recycling unemployed people.

These targets are consistent with the Australian Public Service wide targets as articulated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Strategic Plan for the Australian Public Service for the 1990's. This target is to increase the number of these people to 15% of Australian Public Service employment by the year 2000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) and (b)(i) The Department does not have a target for the number of its employees who are overseas born per se, however, it has a target for the number of employees of non-English speaking background in the context of its Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program. This EEO group includes employees born overseas of non-English speaking background. The target, expressed as a percentage of total staff in the Department's EEO Program 1995-1998, is for non-English speaking staff representation to increase to 30%, (ii) Yes, the Department's target for the number of its employees who are of non-English speaking background is set under its EEO Program 1995-1998 at 30% of total staff numbers, (iii) The Department does not </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre in Townsville will not be forced to close due to financial difficulties. Funding has been authorised which will ensure the financial viability of the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre provides places for 51 children at the present time. There are currently 30 children on the waiting list; this reflects the fact that inquiries about child care places are at a peak over the October&mdash;December period, when Army families are preparing to move to Townsville and are making arrangements for housing and child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre is not the only Defence child care centre not located on a Defence base. The payment of utilities bills, including water, electricity and telephone, is authorised by the local commander in accordance with Defence policy guidelines. Generally, this would involve the establishment of an agreement between the child care centre and the local commander. In the case of the Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre, an agreement with the local commander was not established; consequently there was no visibility of the costs associated with the Centre, and funding provision was not made. This matter has now been addressed, and the local commander has determined that all utilities costs will be paid by Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) and (b) The issue of responsibility for the centre's utilities bills has not arisen previously, as the bills were paid by the Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre Management Committee as they arose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) As a determination has now been made within Defence policy guidelines contained in Defence Instruction (General) Administration 35-1 that the centre is eligible to have its utilities costs met by Defence, funds already expended by the centre's Management Committee on utilities bills will be reimbursed. Reimbursement is being effected now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Under the Defence Employer Sponsored Child Care Program, operational funding is provided by the office of the Australian Defence Families Information and Liaison Staff (ADFILS). Operational funding is based on a formula which allows funding to be allocated on the basis of $1,000 per licensed place per year. Funding is provided in quarterly instalments in advance. The Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre commenced operations in Townsville in January 1994 as a 44 place centre. It was therefore eligible for operational funding of $44,000 per annum. In October 1994, the centre advised ADFILS that it had increased its number of licensed places to 51. Accordingly, in April 1995 its operational funding was increased to $51,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) A request for additional equipment funding to allow the Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre to meet the January 1996 licensing inspection requirement was made to the Army during October 1995. This request has been processed, and the local commander has been authorised to assist with the equipment purchases. This will allow the centre to meet the licensing inspection requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Defence Child Care Guidelines state that an operational subsidy of up to $1,000 per annum for each licensed place will be issued in quarterly instalments for the first two years of operation. The Guidelines also state that child care services must be economically viable, and fee structures must be geared to cost recovery. When the Defence Child Care Guidelines were developed, it was envisaged that the employer-sponsored child care centres would be able to operate on a self-sufficient basis after the first two years. It is now recognised that this may not be achievable for reasons including the extended hours of operation of the centres, the high number of places for babies, the centres' ineligibility for sales tax exemptions, and the effect of posting cycles on enrolments. These difficulties have been recognised by Defence, and a decision was taken in November 1993 that operational funding for Defence Employer Sponsored Child Care centres would be provided on the basis of $1,000 per annum per licensed place for two years, and thereafter would be subject to need with the level of subsidy reducing as centres approach self-sufficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre, as with all Defence Employer Sponsored Child Care centres, will continue to receive operational funding beyond the first two years, in accordance with the policy outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Liaison officers and advisers have worked closely with the Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre Management Committee to provide assistance, particularly in relation to ensuring continuing provision of funding from Defence. The local Army commander has tasked a senior military officer to work closely with the centre's Management Committee to assist with establishing and maintaining visibility of the Centre's financial position. In addition, local commanders from both the Army and the Air Force provide staff support, advice and financial support (within Departmental guidelines) with the intention of ensuring a viable and sustainable child care centre for the Defence community in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The Coral Sea Early Childhood Centre will not be forced to close, therefore children of Defence personnel will not be displaced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question based on information provided by Australia Post:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The postmark for the Marine Life issue on 12 October 1995 included the words "Christmas Island WA 6798", rather than "Christmas Island 6798."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The initials "WA" were inadvertently included in the postmark and, unfortunately, the mistake was not picked-up in subsequent checking procedures. It should be noted that for all other postmarks, the inclusions of an Australian State is mandatory (except for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, for which the abbreviations ACT and NT are required).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) On 2 March 1993, following amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post took over postal and philatelic services on Christmas Island. The stamps of Christmas Island issued after that date are valid for postage throughout Australia, and Australian stamps are valid for postal use on the Island. To denote their new status, "Australia" has been substituted for "Indian Ocean" on Christmas Island stamps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Since March 1993, a total of 13 first day of issue postmarks have been used by Australia Post for Christmas Island stamp issues. The postmark for the Marine Life issue on 12 October 1995 was the only postmark that included the initials "WA".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. Australia Post regrets the mistake and has advised that there was no intention on its part to imply that Christmas Island is part of Western Australia.</PARA>
