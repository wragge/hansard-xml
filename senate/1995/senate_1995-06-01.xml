<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Isn't it true that there are certain agreements between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank which are outlined in the prospectus and which will require $2 billion to be paid to the bank by the government on the removal of the Commonwealth guarantee? That means that the net benefit to the Commonwealth on the sale of the bank and the removal of the guarantee is $2 billion less than its sale price. Does that not make your revenue from asset sales look like just another dose of budget fudge-it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite the minister to reconsider his answer and perhaps explain why pages 51 and 52 of the prospectus, which outlines the default clauses in relation to certain agreements made between the bank and the Commonwealth, do not amount to a requirement that something like $2 billion worth of shares be bought in the bank by the Commonwealth, that is, money paid to the Commonwealth Bank by the government, on the default of one of those agreements; and why he thinks that, as one of the defaults is listed as being removal of the Commonwealth guarantee, the $2 billion will not have to be paid out. Perhaps you could explain some detail about that, Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not show the value of asset sales for any one particular asset; we show a global amount. That is obviously because, if you show what you expect to get for a particular sale, that is what you will get, or maybe less. And the interest for the government and, therefore, for the taxpayer and the Australian electorate is to get for the Commonwealth the maximum possible value for the sale of the asset. If you want me to disaggregate them, I will not, because I want to actually uphold the right of the Australian taxpayer to get the best return possible on the sale of assets and not sabotage the market price.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for the question. It is true; I have certainly written to all members of the parliament outlining the progress of the MFP. I notice that Senator MacGibbon was interjecting, I think sarcastically, but I should point out that a former Liberal Deputy Premier of Queensland, Sir Llew Edwards, has now been appointed chairman of the MFP. He is a very strong supporter of the project as both a national and international project. I think the Liberals from Queensland ought to go and talk with Sir Llew about the MFP in its national perspective; they will find a very strong supporter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also I would point out that there are some Liberal senators here who have now become strong supporters. I acknowledge Senator Alan Ferguson, who has visited the MFP on a number of occasions. He has certainly indicated strong support for the way the MFP is developing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to say that the Liberal government of South Australia is now making major commitments to the MFP. I was at a function the other day in South Australia with Minister Habibie where the Premier of South Australia indicated to Minister Habibie that the MFP was a very important project in South Australia to show Australian technology development, particularly in the environmental area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this all indicates that the cooperation between state and federal government in this area is now working very well. We were pleased at the federal government level that the Liberal government has accepted that the MFP is a national and international project. We were able to reach agreement on the focus of a number of specific projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out that to the end of the 1995-96 financial year the Commonwealth will have spent all up over $60 million on the MFP, mainly through the better cities program, which was agreed with both the previous and the present state government. It is pleasing to note that in recent days in the media in Adelaide there has been speculation and report, I think well sourced, that the state government will increase its commitment to the MFP by a further $6 million to bring it to a total of $36 million next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this indicates that progress is now being made in a substantial way in a number of features of the MFP. First of all, the projects undertaken are world's best practice, particularly in the information technology and environmental areas. Only last week I had the pleasure of opening the New Haven Village, which includes dwellings which are built of sewage sludge bricks and which incorporate new technology such as geothermal heat exchange. The village has its own on-site waste water treatment plant. This was opened in conjunction with the Liberal Minister for Housing in South Australia, Mr Oswald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Haven is an early trial for the stage 1 urban development which we expect to begin next year. This stage 1 will house between 10,000 and 12,000 people, and will be a project of around $1 billion, funded by private investment. Smart City Australia is the name coined to describe the information technology and telecommunications infrastructure and services which are part of that first stage of urban development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently commented in an interview in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> that South Australia has to focus more clearly on capitalising on new business to ensure that it attracts high value, intellectually-based industries, and that the MFP is one of the most important projects to start that development in South Australia. Again I acknowledge the cooperation between the federal and state governments to achieve the successes we are now having with the MFP.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I draw his attention to the fact that a year ago today I asked him about a paper that the Prime Minister said the government was preparing to educate the public about foreign debt. That was after the Prime Minister had told caucus that foreign debt was not bad. I ask the minister: after 16 consecutive monthly worsenings in our accounts with the rest of the world, and after six consecutive monthly current account deficits of over $2 billion&mdash;eight in the last nine months&mdash;does he and the Prime Minister still believe that Australia's net foreign debt of over $160 billion is not bad? Can he advise the Senate on the state of the preparation of the paper that he and the Prime Minister promised? Why have Australia's men, women and children, who now owe the equivalent of nearly $10,000 each in foreign debt as a result of the policies of this government, still not sighted this paper which was promised a year ago? Is it because any assessment of the facts could only conclude that Australia's foreign debt is now so bad that it is strangling our future economic prosperity? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="695" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there is no justification for that kind of alarmism about Australia's foreign debt. The truth of the matter is that our foreign debt has fallen by $9.5 billion over the year to December last year. It has fallen from around 42 per cent of GDP to an estimated 37 per cent of GDP, which is its lowest level as a proportion of GDP since December 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That trend can be expected to continue with the structural changes that have been introduced in the present budget. The worsening trend in the current account deficit, which is the major single contributor to that debt, has passed with the current account deficit remaining stable and expected to come down further as a percentage of GDP in the period ahead, and with less of a call on overseas capital to deal with that as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, Australia's ability to service its debt has improved very significantly over the last few years. The key measure, as Senator Short will know, for the international assessment of the significance of any country's debt is the debt servicing ratio&mdash;the proportion of your exports that you need to pay the interest bill on that debt. The net foreign debt servicing ratio fell from 20.7 per cent in 1990 to 11.4 per cent at the end of last year, which is around its lowest level for almost a decade. That reflects lower world interest rates and strong growth in exports&mdash;almost 8 per cent per annum over the four years to 1993-94. That is another phenomenon about the Australian economy, which you continue to talk down, but which is the source of the underlying strength we undoubtedly possess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to expect the debt servicing ratio to be subject to upward pressure at this stage of the recovery cycle but future rises will be moderated in turn by the pick-up in commodity prices, which are helping to underpin the continued strong growth in exports despite the familiar negative effects of the drought, and the likelihood that interest rates will not need to rise as far as in previous cycles&mdash;if, indeed, they have to rise at all in the present environment, but we are a prisoner of world phenomena in this respect, not just the domestic circumstances&mdash;because of the fall in inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs also to be recalled, whenever you talk about foreign debt, that overwhelmingly it is a product of the activities of the private sector rather than of governments. In December 1994, 55 per cent of our debt was owed by the private sector, 26 per cent by state governments, 12 per cent by public enterprises and only six per cent of that was owed by the Commonwealth government. It is always important to put that particular fact in context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are talking about further bits of paper to describe all that, if that is what you want, you can find as many details as you lot are capable of absorbing in the budget papers. Beyond that, I will check to see what progress has been made in the production of the paper on that issue. We have nothing whatsoever to hide. It is a good story to tell, so far as this aspect of the economy, along with every other aspect of our economic management, is concerned.</PARA>

What is the status of the paper that he and the Prime Minister promised a year ago would be prepared? In the course of the preparation of that paper will he include the fact that, contrary to what he has just said, the proportion of our hard-earned export earnings required to meet the interest bill on our foreign debt has continued to increase since last year's statement that the paper would be prepared because of the concern about debt and that the debt servicing ratio now is worse than it was at the time of the Prime Minister's infamous banana republic statement of May 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our ability to ensure the safety and wellbeing of submariners, both in their normal operating environment and during the forthcoming sea trials of the Collins class submarine, is a matter of prime importance. I am pleased to advise the Senate that a contract has been awarded to the Australian Submarine Corporation for an integrated submarine escape and rescue service which will support the navy submarine operations into the next century. The contract will initially run for five years, at a cost of $20 million. Escape from a disabled submarine down to a depth of 180 metres is possible by survivors making their way to the surface independently, where they are met by a rescue vehicle with recompression and medical support. This escape facility is now in place for the Collins shallow water trials which will commence in the next few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rescue operations beyond that depth are far more difficult and require unique equipment. The purchase of this equipment and the rescue capability will place the navy in a small group of nations which maintain a rescue system, and will in fact be equal to the best available anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The service will incorporate a modified rescue vehicle, called a diving bell, to rescue survivors of a submarine accident down to a depth at which the hull of the new Collins class submarine would begin to collapse. One of the unique features will be the ability for a rescue to proceed even when the submarine is lying at extreme angles. It will also be able to be used when the submarine has an increased internal pressure, and will allow the transfer of survivors under pressure to recompression chambers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract with the Australian Submarine Corporation will also include maintenance and deployment of a rescue service and the development of contingency plans involving civil and military authorities. It also provides for a support vessel from which to deploy and operate the vehicle, and an integrated logistic support package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system will be in place in late 1995 and be first used to conduct the deep sea dive trials of the lead Collins class submarine. The decision to acquire such a facility in Australia rather than relying on what is available overseas has only recently become a viable option for the navy to pursue because of the recent advances in technology which provide a capable solution at a reasonable cost.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. I refer to the Review Conference on Landmines in Cambodia this month and the Review Conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention in Vienna in September. How can the government justify not supporting a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines, including their manufacture, given their appalling record as an indiscriminate destructive weapon which is mainly targeted at civilians in regions of conflict and whose effects are felt a long time after the conflict is over? Given that there is no guarantee that anti-personnel landmines with self-destruct mechanisms will actually self-destruct, and both self-destruct and detectable landmines are far more expensive than cheaper plastic devices, why does the government believe that a partial ban on landmines would be at all effective?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="697" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only reason we are opposing the banning absolutely of the production and deployment of landmines is that to seek to do that would be hopelessly utopian. I know that that is never a disincentive for your particular party in these matters, but it is one of the problems that we confront in the real world that the rest of us inhabit. The difficulty about living in that particular real world is that most governments do regard landmines as a legitimate defensive conventional weapon when, of course, used in accordance with the rules of war&mdash;namely, that you map where you put them and you take them up afterwards. That is the way in which landmines had traditionally been deployed and utilised, until we got into the cycle of appalling civil war and utilisation of such weapons in Afghanistan, Cambodia and elsewhere of recent years where, obviously, no rules of that kind have remotely thought of being applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landmines, as a remotely controlled or as a delayed action weapon, do perform a unique military function in protection of our defence forces and those of our allies in the field, and one simply cannot argue with the military realities in that respect. Certainly, those military realities are governing the reaction of governments all round the world when it comes to changing the Inhumane Weapons Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk to civilians, the real issue that we are all trying to address, arises because mines remain unexploded after hostilities cease and when battlefields have returned to civilian uses. That is why we are pushing for this ban on long-lived landmines&mdash;those which do not self-destruct over a certain period&mdash;and for a requirement for routine marking, monitoring and fencing of minefields to protect civilians. They are more costly, as you acknowledge; nonetheless, there is a mood among governments around the world to consider seriously that particular option and to pursue it. Given the available choices, which is between doing something and basically being able to do nothing, we are trying very hard to do something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we approach the Review Conference on the Inhumane Weapons Convention, and as we approach the NGO conference that  you referred to, which will take place in Phnom Penh, as you say, later this week, and where our ambassador will be participating and where we are in fact making a financial contribution to that conference, our priority has been to try to get support for such a selective ban on the use of long-lived anti-personnel landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to put a ban on the transfer of prohibited classes of landmines to non-states parties to the convention, and we want to restrict the transfers of permitted landmines, as a consequence, to states parties. We want to extend the protocol to cover non-international conflicts, these crucially important internal ones where most of the problem has been, and we want to try to develop better verification and compliance provisions so far as use is concerned. That is our strategy. Obviously, you do not regard it as an optimal one, and I can understand that. But, realistically, it is the only one available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do in addition to all of that is make a major contribution to the demining of all those various parts of the world where the legacy of past misbehaviour in this respect continues to wreak havoc. We are making a significant financial contribution to the Cambodian government. We are making a financial contribution to the UN mine clearance program in Afghanistan.

Can the minister explain the difference between a landmine and a pressure activated grenade with a trip-wire? Can the minister confirm that Australia exports these devices?

It is obvious from the latest national accounts that the budget has badly overestimated the rate of household saving. The budget expects household savings to rise, but according to the national accounts they are in free fall. In the last quarter, household savings came in at a mere 2.6 per cent of disposable income. What possible reason could you have for believing that the ratio, which is approaching zero, could suddenly reverse itself and register five per cent plus? Isn't the decline in family saving likely to continue and be reflected in stronger spending and an even worse current account deficit than you have estimated?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for her question. This is a very significant justice statement. A very important part of that statement is its commitment to increasing access to justice for women. Perhaps the most important and significant way this will happen is through the establishment of eight new legal centres for women. That will involve an expenditure of $17.3 million over the next four years. That will be a huge boon for women in terms of access to legal services. There are some legal services already in existence. Certainly in my own state of South Australia there is one. I have been advised that that centre will receive top-up funding and a new centre is to be established in the state. Before anything else, we now have the establishment of that network of legal centres for women. That will be a huge boon for women who will then have a difference sense of confidence in approaching the legal services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, there will be outreach workers in non-metropolitan community centres.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women we will establish specialist services throughout the network of women's legal centres. There will also be a focus on women with disability, women living in poverty and women from non-English speaking backgrounds. So the new access to justice emphasis takes account of all those special needs of women. The statement will lead to a breakdown of systemic bias against women in the law and the legal system. There will be an increase of $17 million to the legal aid system to allow it to move away from focusing on criminal matters and to address much more assistance to family and civil law matters, particularly as these are much more likely to be the areas where women are looking for legal aid when coming into the legal arena.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is a better question because it does not have some of the negativity that the opposition has been going on with. Professor Habibie, at my invitation, visited Australia for 10 days between 21 and 31 May. He visited a number of important capital cities: Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. He had a 50-strong delegation of senior officials and business people in attendance with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is, of course, a key member of the Indonesian government. His visit is important in cementing closer ties between Australia and Indonesia, and his responsibility in the Indonesian economy is to Indonesia's research infrastructure. But he has a much wider range of responsibilities, including, of course, the development of Indonesia's strategic industries and the accelerated industrial development of the country through the application of technology industries such as aerospace, electronics and shipbuilding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Habibie met extensively with state premiers, governors and ministers and federal ministers. At his end of visit press conference he said that he was highly impressed with the possibilities of greater collaboration between Indonesian and Australian companies and institutions. He was exposed to a broad range of Australian technological competence and was clearly impressed by that. He visited a number of institutes such as the CSIRO, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, the Submarine Corporation, the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of his visit Professor Habibie and I had further talks and recognised that there is significant scope for technological cooperation and collaboration between our two countries for the mutual benefit of both. We signed a memorandum of understanding to implement new arrangements under the protocol called COSTI&mdash;the Committee of Science and Technology Australia-Indonesia. These new arrangements will accommodate significant new opportunities afforded following the signing of the agreement for cooperation in science and technology during the ministerial forum last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also agreed to give high priority to a range of existing projects under COSTI and other mechanisms in the aerospace, energy, remote sensing, environment, infrastructure, automotive, marine biology, telecommunications and medical research fields. We also agreed to consider suitable vehicles for strengthening the partnership between Australia and Indonesia in six key areas: in developing our aerospace industries; in collaboration in the automotive industry; expanding beef production; developing Nurtano Island as a major industrial site; expanding steel production; and using Australia's solar cell technology for electricity production.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect that it was probably some bad dog food. I was trying to point out that the franchising industry is a major part of the Australian economy. It has a turnover of about $40 billion per year, employs nearly 300,000 Australians and has a growth rate of around 15 per cent per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The franchising industry and the development of it offers a very effective way for many people to enter small business for the first time in a structured way with assistance from their franchisor. However, there have been consistent complaints that some of the contractual arrangements between a franchisor and franchisee often leave something to be desired and that there is not full transparency in the arrangements and the contract between both the franchisor and the franchisee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government have always argued that we want an effective voluntary code without government regulation. All franchisors would sign up to and accept that code, which establishes best practice and full transparency in the arrangements between a franchisor and franchisee. Unfortunately, some significant franchisors in Australia have refused to join the code. In particular, the motor car manufacturers in Australia have not signed the code, despite a lot of pressure from their dealers. This is a disappointment to the government. We have also found that some other smaller franchisors have refused to join the code, so the code probably has about a 60 per cent acceptance and signing up rate by franchisors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also note as a result of a survey last year which was part of the Gardini review that 16 or 17 per cent of franchisors are or have been in commercial dispute with at least one of their franchisees. We think that figure is far too high. It does not establish a climate of confidence for franchisees&mdash;people who want to become involved in the franchising industry and take it up. Therefore, last year I commissioned the Gardini review to look at ways in which these matters could be dealt with and whether there was a case for a modest government regulatory approach. Gardini has recommended a modest regulatory approach. It is now out for comment. I have received a lot of comment from those involved in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at the same time as we are dealing with issues of others not joining the code, I am also dealing with issues of the petroleum code and trying to get a voluntary outcome there. Over all, there is now growing pressure from the small business industry as well as in the franchising sector that the development of a strengthened unconscionable conduct provision under the Trade Practices Act may provide better protection for franchisees and establish proper transparency in arrangements. They are very reasonable questions that have been raised by me with the small business community. At the moment, it is under review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I anticipate taking a number of these matters to cabinet within the next six weeks to two months as part of looking at unconscionable conduct and franchising issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To even understand that a difficulty exists when it fact it would appear, on the advice that we have, that it is not only a difficulty but a very serious difficulty, and one that should have been addressed by any competent administration. In fact the administrative appeal case that you referred to, Senator Cook, did not in itself disclose the failure of your administration or that of your predecessor at all. That case related to the terms of the guidelines and as to whether the guidelines had been properly applied; the fact that they had not been tabled was not then in issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may. The facts seem to be that two years ago, when the guidelines should have been tabled in this place, they were not. Therefore, as the minister says, under the terms of the Acts Interpretation Act, after a very short period of time they cease to have effect and every application that has been made for R&amp;D assistance since has been made on the basis of guidelines that are invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is now saying that he is seeking, two years later, to overcome the difficulty by tabling the guideline. But when he goes back and opens his basic law text, he will find in fact that that is not an option open to him. When he picks up his responsibility of properly administering his portfolio he will find in fact the only option that is open to him is to amend the act and to seek to apply the amendment retrospectively. That will involve some two years retrospectivity. That of course will raise all sorts of difficult questions about natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is beyond my comprehension, and that of honourable senators on my side, how&mdash;in a proper administration, an administration of which the minister is the head&mdash;this failure could not have been recognised for a period of two years. What sort of processes are in place within the department? What sort of structures are there? What sort of checking mechanisms are in place which do not permit this oversight to be picked up for a period of two years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the consequences are potentially horrendous. It means that every applicant who has made an application and who has failed&mdash;the syndicates have broken up; obviously there has been enormous economic cost in putting applications together&mdash;now has a potential right of action against the government and therefore a potential right of damages at a cost to the taxpayer. One can only speculate at this stage about what sorts of figures are involved but, if there is about $2 billion worth of successful grants which have been approved, and the ratio of rejection has been something like 3:1, the taxpayer has every reason to be deeply concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems, though, that the minister knew nothing about it. When he was asked the question here today about the basis of this failure, he did not have any answer at all. Either he just does not care, he does not do his job properly or he knew and just believed that he would be able to fudge the issue&mdash;or all of the above. It must be one of the worst cases of incompetent administration that we have seen in public office for a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is only starting today.

That will not solve the problem for the taxpayers, unfortunately, but this government has never been particularly concerned with the interests of the taxpayers. If Senator Cook is not concerned with the taxpayers, what about the investment that has been lost as a result of all this?

The government finally undertook a review and suggestions and recommendations were put forward as to the various aspects of the treatment of income and assets for the purpose of assessing the pension. The government has not responded totally to ageing agendas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried to address the issue of the very unfair test of including unrealised capital gains as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. When the sharemarket was going up we had pensioners writing to us. Pensioners found that their pensions were varying enormously and it was impossible for them to make any sort of plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have these new changes. The government is giving pensioners who have investments a window of opportunity to rearrange their pre-1988 investments. On Monday morning an article in the investment section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, written by Ian Hamilton, issued a warning to pensioners who hold market-linked managed investments, friendly society bonds and insurance bonds which they had held prior to 1988. The article read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in the way the income test applies to pre September 9, 1988, market-linked management investments and pre January 1, 1988, friendly society bonds and insurance bonds are set to come into effect in January next year (or when passed by Parliament).</PARA>

<PARA>I saw that as serious and thought that the government should be taking some action to advise those pensioners who hold those sorts of investments as to the problems associated with this window of opportunity. What does the minister have to say when I ask her a question about this? Nothing. She does not know. It is not as if she has not been warned&mdash;headline: `Pension warning on bonds'&mdash;and I think we should have had an answer from the minister in the chamber today about what the government is going to do to alert those pensioners to the possibility that I believe exists, given what this article says, that they could lose part or all their pension if they choose to sell their bonds or their investments before a certain date and reinvestment them. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 February 1995 requesting my advice in respect of matters contained in amendments to the Customs Regulations (the Regulations) effected by Statutory Rule No. 445 of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Regulations by regulations 180 and 181 were required for the purposes of new section 269TAAD and new subsections 269TAC(5A) and (5B) of the Customs Act 1901 (the Act). These  new provisions were inserted in the Act by the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization) Amendment Act 1994 (WTO Act) to enable Australia to meet its obligations under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade with respect to its anti-dumping and countervailing regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 269TAC of the Act sets out the methods for calculating the normal value of goods the subject of a dumping application, which is an essential step in determining whether the dumping of goods has occurred. Under subsection 269TAC(1), the normal value of goods is basically the price paid for like goods sold in the ordinary course of trade in the country of export. Subsection 269TAC(12) previously set out the method for determining if the price paid for goods was paid in the ordinary course of trade and this was replaced by new section 269TAAD, mainly for ease of reading and understanding of the provision. New section 269TAAD reiterates the provisions of old subsection 269TAC(12) and includes additional matters which the Minister must consider in ascertaining whether price has been paid in the ordinary course of trade. New subsection 269TAAD(5) requires the Minister to work out certain amounts under subsection 269TAAD(4) in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide and regulations 180 and 181 were made for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining provisions of section 269TAC govern the calculation of the normal value of goods by the Minister where normal value cannot be ascertained under subsection (1). These provisions require the Minister, for example, to determine the costs of manufacture of production of goods and the rate of profit on the sale of goods&mdash;these amounts are then used to calculate the normal value of goods. New subsection 269TAC(5A) provides that amounts determined under the specified paragraphs of section 269TAC must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors, as the regulations provide for the purposes of section 269TAAD ie, regulations 180 and 181. Subsection 269TAC(5B) also provides that the amount determined to be the profit on the sale of goods must be worked out in such manner, and taking account of such factors as the regulations provide. Regulation 181 was also made for the purposes of this subsection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many dumping investigations, however, there may be insufficient information available to the Minister, or insufficient information may have been supplied, to enable the normal value to be calculated in accordance with any of the methods specified in section 269TAC. This is often the case as the provision of information to the Minister during the conduct of a dumping investigation is on a purely voluntary basis. The Minister has no power to compel or coerce persons to provide information that is relevant to a dumping investigation. It is for this reason that subsection 269TAC(6) provides that where the Minister is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished, or is not available, to enable the normal value of goods to be ascertained under the preceding subsections, the normal value of goods is such amount as it determined by the Minister having regard to all relevant information. This method of ascertaining the normal value of goods is a `last resort' method and is only used if all other preceding methods in section 269TAC cannot be used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also for this reason that the Minister may, for the purposes of section 269TAC, disregard any information that is considered by the Minister to be unreliable. This power, which is contained in subsection 269TAC(7), was previously exercisable only for the purposes of subsection 269TAC(6) but is now expressed to be for the purposes of the section 269TAC as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter, you refer to the fact that some of the amendments to the Regulations, being regulations 180 and 181, confer wide discretions on the Minister. Subregulation 180(6) provides that if the Minister is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished or is not available to enable the cost of production or manufacture to be worked out under the preceding subregulations, the cost is the amount determined by the Minister having regard to the relevant information. Subregulation 180(7) provides that the Minister may disregard any information considered unreliable, for the purposes of regulation 180. The provisions of subregulations 181(4) and (6) are similar to subregulations 180(6) and (7).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As can be seen from the outline of section 269TAC above, the discretions in regulations 180 and 181 are identical to those the Minister exercises under section 269TAC. As referred to above, the provisions of section 269TAAD are directly applied for the purposes of section 269TAC&mdash;the `ordinary course of trade' test is an essential element in determining the normal value of goods. It is, therefore, considered the discretions that the Minister exercises under subsections 269TAC(6) and (7) should also be exercisable for the purposes of section 269TAAD for the same reasons that these provisions are included in section 269TAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that identical provisions to subsections 269TAC(6) and (7) exist in section 269TAB of the Act. This section governs the calculation of the export price of goods which is another essential step in determining whether the dumping of goods has occurred. Under subsection 269TAB(3), the export price of the goods shall be such amount determined by the Minister where he or she is satisfied that sufficient information has not been furnished, or is not available, to enable the export price to be ascertained under the preceding subsections. The Minister may also disregard any unreliable information when determining export price under subsection 269TAB(4). These discretions have been included for the purposes of determining the export price of goods for the same reasons the identical provisions were included in section 269TAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter, you seek my confirmation that the exercise of the discretions under subregulations 180(6) and (7) and 181(4) and (6), as well as others in these regulations, is subject to independent review. I confirm that the decisions made by the Minister in the exercise of these discretions are decisions that may be subject to judicial review by the Federal Court of Australia under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (ADJR Act). As decisions that are made by the Minister in exercise of the discretions fall within the definition of decisions to which the ADJR Act applies, application may be made to the Federal Court for the review of such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the ADJR Act review, the structure of Australia's anti-dumping provisions provide an additional opportunity for the exercise of these discretions to be reviewed. The discretions could be exercised in the context of an investigation culminating in either a Preliminary Finding or a Final Finding. The Australian Customs Service (ACS) has responsibility for conducting investigations culminating in a Preliminary Funding. The Anti-Dumping Authority (ADA) is responsible for the conduct of investigations culminating in a Final Finding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of a Preliminary Finding should the ACS investigation culminate in a Positive Preliminary Finding the matter is then required to be referred to the ADA for full merit review. Thus the exercise of the discretions by the ACS officers are the subject of a review by the ADA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the above comments are of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 March 1994 the Government appointed a Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) headed by The Honourable Gordon J Samuels AC QC and Mr Michael H Codd AC. The terms of reference of the Inquiry required the Commissioners to:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv)the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to ASIS; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b)to consider whether any changes in existing arrangements are required or desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>In setting up the Inquiry, the Government was mindful of the desirability of periodic `root and branch' reviews of the intelligence and security agencies. Although the roles, functions and performance of the intelligence and security agencies had been reviewed extensively by the Government in 1992, there had not been a thorough independent judicial review of ASIS since the second Hope Royal Commission into the intelligence and security agencies in 1984. I had been considering in 1993, well before any individual grievances became public, whether it was time for another review of ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was also concerned by the apparent failure of some former ASIS officers to accept the results of the investigations of their grievances by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and by the development of a damaging media campaign directed against both ASIS and the Inspector-General, culminating in the ABC 4 Corners program that went to air on 21 February 1994. In all the circumstances as they evolved, the Government felt that an Inquiry was needed to provide a reassurance to the public of the proper functioning of ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission of Inquiry into ASIS reported to Government on 31 March 1995. Before commenting on the Report itself, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioners and their staff on behalf of the Government for their hard work and dedication. The Report is a perceptive, rigorous and comprehensive examination of ASIS. Like the Reports of the two Hope Royal Commissions in 1977 and 1984, this Report forms an important building block in the arrangements for the oversight and accountability of the Australian intelligence and security agencies. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THE REPORT</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners' full Report consists of two substantive volumes, plus a volume of appendices containing lists of witnesses, organisation charts and the like. The first volume deals with the issues related to the four main elements in the terms of reference&mdash;control and accountability, organisation and management, protection of sources and methods, and the resolution of grievances and complaints. Although this volume is classified, the Commissioners have recommended that large parts of it be made public, subject only to such deletions as are necessary to</PARA>
<PARA>protect national security and privacy. The Government has agreed to do this: edited in line with the Commissioners' recommendations, it is tabled with this statement as the Public Edition of the Report. (The Commissioners' summary Public Report was tabled in the Senate on 24 April 1995. It is reproduced at pages xix-xxxvi of the Public Edition tabled today.)</PARA>
<PARA>The second volume deals in detail with the cases of the former ASIS officers and the wife of one of those former officers, who were represented jointly before the Inquiry (referred to hereafter as the complainants). For reasons of privacy and national security, and consistent with the Commissioners' recommendation, the Government does not intend to make public any part of this volume. The Government has agreed with the Commissioners' recommendation that the complainants and their legal representatives be allowed to see those parts of the second volume which relate to their individual cases, on conditions of strict confidentiality. All but one of the complainants availed themselves of this offer. </PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with past practice, the Government has provided the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Foreign Minister with a copy of the full classified Report subject to assurances of confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA>In tabling this Report, the Government is making a significant advance in what it is prepared to say publicly about ASIS. In the past, successive Governments have strictly limited the extent of their public comment on ASIS in the interests of national security. But while we judge that it is now an appropriate time to be more forthcoming than we have been in the past, there is still a self-evident need for certain kinds of information relating to ASIS, and intelligence and security in general, to remain secret so as to protect national security, the safety of individuals, and Australia's international relations. This especially includes information that could identify ASIS officers, sources and methods; places of ASIS deployment and operation; areas and issues of intelligence interest; and the purpose or objectives of individual operations, be they past, current or projected. The continuing need for certain details about ASIS to remain secret is wholeheartedly endorsed by the Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>MAJOR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Control and Accountability of ASIS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Because of the highly delicate nature of ASIS's work, special arrangements have existed for its control and accountability. The current arrangements were put in place following the two Hope Royal Commissions into the intelligence and security agencies&mdash;the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security in 1977 and the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies and 1984. The most significant outcome of these inquiries for the control and accountability of the intelligence and security agencies was the recognition of the fundamental principle that the agencies should be under the control of, and properly accountable to, Ministers for their activities. Mr Justice Hope saw this as essential in circumstances where the majority of those agencies' activities are shielded from public view. Through Ministers, the agencies are accountable to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>ASIS is an arm of the executive government, and is subject to Ministerial direction like any other department or agency of government. In the case of ASIS, Ministerial control is exercised by the Foreign Minister through the Director-General of ASIS. The Minister presently exercises this control both directly and through the ASIS Directive, which sets limits to the activities that ASIS may perform, and specifies approval for certain kinds of activities. Broader Ministerial oversight of ASIS and the other agencies is exercised by the Security Committee of Cabinet, with officials-level advice being coordinated by the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security (SCIS). Intelligence priorities are set by the Security Committee of Cabinet, which also scrutinises the performance of the agencies. Independent oversight of the agencies' compliance with Australian law and propriety is provided by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners have found that the current arrangements for control and accountability are highly effective. In particular, they have found that ASIS acts only in response to direction from the Government; that the procedures for the approval, development and carrying out of operational proposals have been meticulously observed by ASIS; and that these procedures would make it impossible to conceal illicit operational activity from Government. To quote the Commissioners:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have discovered no evidence capable of supporting the conclusion that ASIS is operating out of control . . . or pursuing its own targets unrestrained by any government agency, or is unaccountable for the activities it undertakes or the funds it expends. . . . On the contrary its operational management is well structured and its tactical decisions are thoroughly considered and, in major instances, subject to external approval. . . . It does not maintain `tens of thousands of files' containing dossiers about Australian citizens, as alleged in the media. We have absolutely no reason to suppose that, again as alleged, in November 1994 it set fire to embarrassing records so as to prejudice the work of this inquiry. It does not represent a threat to Australian democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Commissioners go on to suggest ways in which the arrangements for control and accountability might usefully be enhanced, they point out that this should not be taken to imply that the current arrangements have failed, or taken as a response to disorder. They say rather that their report "provided an opportunity for a review of the arrangements for control and accountability of ASIS in the context of the relevant reforms of recent years in the Australian public sector. . . " and the changes proposed by them "are a response to that opportunity, not a criticism of the current accountability regime". </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Legislation</EMPHASIS>. The Commissioners have recommended several measures to enhance the degree of, and widen the scope of the arrangements for, ASIS accountability. The first and most important of these is to place ASIS on a statutory basis through the enactment of legislation. Mr Justice Hope recommended in 1977 that ASIS be placed on a statutory basis. His recommendation was not taken up by the Fraser Government on the basis that it was judged unnecessary. The recommendation was not renewed in the second Hope Royal Commission. The Commissioners are very firmly of the view that legislation to affirm ASIS's existence and to provide for parliamentary acknowledgment of its role and functions is desirable in principle and will be of benefit in practice. They believe it will serve to reassure the public that the activities of ASIS are properly authorised and controlled and help to dispel the persistent mythology that ASIS is out of control. Overall, they argue that the move from an executive to a legislative charter would add a significant new dimension to the accountability framework for ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts this recommendation, and proposes to introduce legislation at the earliest practical opportunity. ASIS is a valuable national asset which serves and protects Australia's national interest through the collection of foreign intelligence. It is desirable that this role be afforded public recognition. It is also important, from the point of view of protecting democratic freedoms, that ASIS's activities be regulated in a way which provides a significant degree of reassurance to the public. Legislation is an appropriate way to achieve these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>As I pointed out before, the recommendation that accountability be enhanced does not suggest that the current arrangements have failed. Similarly, the proposal for legislation should not be taken to imply that ASIS has acted outside the law. ASIS is and has always been subject to Australian law like any other government agency. And the move to legislation should not be interpreted as a sign that the Government regards Ministerial responsibility for the intelligence and security agencies as less important now than previously. On the contrary, strong executive control remains fundamental. The Government's support for legislation signifies that it feels a legislative rather than an executive charter would provide a more relevant and publicly acceptable basis for ASIS's existence in the post-Cold War world. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners have provided detailed recommendations on what legislation for ASIS should include. As with the ASIO Act, these include specific limits on ASIS's functions, activities and powers, the powers and responsibilities of the Director-General, privacy rules, and provision for the legal protection of the identities of ASIS officers and sources, briefing of the Opposition Leader on ASIS, and the creation of a joint statutory parliamentary committee on ASIS. In all these matters we will be guided in large measure by the specific suggestions of the Commissioners. While discussion of legislative detail is better left to Parliament when a Bill is introduced, it is appropriate now to specify the Government's responses to the major legislative proposals. These responses, like the others in this Statement, have been the subject of discussion with the Shadow Foreign Minister and represent, it is believed, a broad measure of agreement between Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Briefing of Opposition</EMPHASIS>. Since the two Hope Royal Commissions, Governments of both political persuasions have adopted a practice of keeping the Opposition Leader and, as appropriate, shadow Ministers, informed of significant intelligence and security matters, on the understanding that these briefings remain strictly confidential in order to protect national security. Such briefings do not include operationally sensitive details. The Commissioners have recommended that the Opposition Leader be given a right of access to briefings on ASIS, and that this right be enshrined in legislation. Such a right currently exists for the Opposition Leader in the case of ASIO, but it remains at the discretion of the Government in the case of the other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the value of keeping the Opposition regularly informed of significant intelligence and security matters, and is prepared, subject always to the exercise of Ministerial discretion, to continue that practice at an expanded and more frequent level, with briefings to be provided every six months, and otherwise on request. While a statutory right to briefings is justified in the case of ASIO to ensure that the agency is not misused for political purposes, there is less justification for such an automatic right in the case of ASIS, which has far less potential to affect the civil rights of Australians or to conduct activities with domestic political implications. ASIS is an agency of Government subject to ministerial responsibility and control. It is not above Government in any way. For these reasons, it is best that the practice of briefing of the Opposition on ASIS matters remains at the discretion of the Government. But the Government does agree that more regular briefings would be desirable. Obviously, as was the case in the past, it is essential that the Opposition respects the confidentiality of the information that is provided. Overall, the Government accepts the practical outcome intended by the Commissioners, but with the maintenance of the current formalities and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Parliamentary Committee</EMPHASIS>. Another significant recommendation is the creation of a joint statutory parliamentary committee to oversee the activities, expenditure and administration of ASIS and ASIO. The Commissioners also recommend that such a committee replace the current Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO. They recommend that the committee be small and consist of experienced parliamentarians; that it operate in camera; that it have the power to initiate its own inquiries and have access to relevant information (including reports of the Inspector-General on ASIS's compliance with the law and other rules and procedures, but not including operationally sensitive information); that its staff be security cleared, and that members be subject to strict sanctions for the unauthorised disclosure of classified information. While the Commissioners do not contend that a parliamentary committee is a prerequisite or necessary accompaniment for legislation, they do point out the desirability, in the interests of greater accountability, of the Parliament having a more direct, albeit limited, role in the oversight of ASIS than it does now. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts in principle the value of limited parliamentary oversight of ASIS. ASIS, like any other agency of government, can benefit from responsible parliamentary scrutiny. The highly delicate and secret nature of ASIS's work necessarily places limits on the information a parliamentary committee could receive or upon which it could report. Nevertheless, the Government has explored appropriate designs for a committee model which satisfy the needs of both accountability and secrecy, and would be prepared to accept a committee model constructed along lines similar to those proposed by the Commissioners, but with some limited amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners recommended that there be a combined committee on ASIS and ASIO. Whereas the domestic security agency's activities necessarily have great potential to impinge on the rights and privacy of Australians, this potential does not exist in the case of ASIS, whose activities are focused almost exclusively overseas. In the Government's view, this means the case for parliamentary scrutiny of ASIS is more qualified than it is in the case of ASIO. It also means that the nature of parliamentary scrutiny that is appropriate for ASIS is not necessarily the same as that which is appropriate for ASIO. For these reasons, the Government does not favour the proposal that a single parliamentary committee should oversee both ASIO and ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government favours a small committee on ASIS, comprising six members, appointed by the Parliament on the nomination of the Government, with three members from the Government and three members from the Opposition, with the Government providing the Chair who would have a casting vote. The committee's role would be to review the expenditure and administration of ASIS, and ASIS's compliance with Australian law and other rules and procedures. The committee secretariat would be security-cleared and seconded from the executive Government. This committee model resembles, to a significant extent, that currently in place in the UK. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the enactment of legislation and the establishment of a parliamentary committee, the Commissioners propose some additional enhancements to accountability. This includes modifications to the ASIS Directive, an expansion of the Inspector-General's monitoring role, opening up ASIS's exempt operational account to external auditing by the Australian National Audit Office, and making the Director-General of ASIS a full member of the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ASIS Directive</EMPHASIS>. The proposed modifications to the ASIS Directive are relatively minor and would be largely consequential on the enactment of legislation. They include the omission of provisions which will no longer be necessary once legislation is passed. Other changes are secret, or involve minor administrative detail which need not be discussed here. However, two points are worthy of mention. The modifications do not entail any alteration to ASIS's basic functions or powers. ASIS will still be prevented from carrying out, or training to carry out, covert action, by which I mean interference in the internal affairs of other countries by means of paramilitary action or covert interference in politics. Second, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to have an important role in commenting on ASIS's operational proposals and ensuring ASIS is guided by, and does not run counter to, Australian foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compliance Audits by Inspector-General</EMPHASIS>. The Commissioners recommend an expansion of the role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in monitoring ASIS through a system of retrospective audits of ASIS's compliance with Australian law and with operational rules and procedures. Such a system would provide further reassurance to the Minister and the Parliament that ASIS abides by the rules. It is also proposed that a parliamentary committee on ASIS would have access to the broader findings of such audits. Again, this is proposed as an enhancement of the existing accountability arrangements. The Government supports this recommendation for retrospective compliance audits by the Inspector-General. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">External Financial Audit</EMPHASIS>. The Commissioners propose a system of external audit of ASIS's finances by the Australian National Audit Office. The majority of ASIS's finances are already subject to external audit. But its exempt operational account is audited by an internal auditor who reports to the Director-General, who in turn reports to the Minister. (A similar arrangement applies to ASIO's operational accounts.) The Commissioners propose that ASIS's exempt account be audited by a senior officer of the ANAO, with appropriate safeguards and procedures to protect the security of the information in question. The Government supports this recommendation for ASIS, and will adopt a similar approach for ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Secretaries Committee</EMPHASIS>. The Government has accepted the Commissioners' recommendation that the Director-General of ASIS be made a full member of the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security. With ASIS now to be subject to legislation and parliamentary oversight, inclusion of the Director-General would help better to integrate ASIS into the higher policy-making machinery, and would improve its interaction with the rest of Government. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Organisation and Management of ASIS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In their consideration of the organisation and management of ASIS, the Commissioners paint a picture of a highly skilled, focused and dedicated organisation that is highly attuned to its core function of collecting intelligence. One consequence of this strong focus on ensuring ASIS does its job well has been a high degree of concern for secrecy. For reasons I have explained before, this concern for secrecy is unavoidable. The need for secrecy imposes great burdens upon ASIS officers, such as not being able to discuss their experiences with their friends and family. This burden also has its effect on management, sometimes in ways which don't necessarily reflect modern management practice. The need for secrecy and strict compliance with directions has, in the Commissioners' view, led to the development of a culture which values conformity above diversity and executive direction over consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>The extent to which some management practices within ASIS have been deficient is closely related to the issue of the internal resolution of grievances, which I will deal with in a moment. Those deficiencies have manifested themselves in part through the cases of the complainants. The Commissioners did not find the gamut of inefficiencies, impropriety, or gross incompetence which had been alleged by the former ASIS officers. But they did find that there had been some shortcomings in ASIS's internal management, particularly with regard to the methods it adopted to deal with allegations of misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that many of the events that were subject of complaint occurred some years ago, in some cases up to ten years. The Commissioners have also noted that the current Director-General has acknowledged many of these problems and has taken steps of his own initiative, without prompting from the Inquiry or from the Government, to address them. The Government commends this approach by the Director-General. </PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to comment extensively on the Commissioners' recommendations on organisation and management without divulging details of ASIS's methods of operation. As has been stated, the Commissioners did not recommend that these parts of the full Report be made public. But in essence, they propose a number of management reforms aimed at developing an internal culture which respects differences and diversity between staff and management as healthy rather than threatening. They include greater emphasis on corporate planning; greater delegation of functions by the Director-General and enhanced executive support; more uniform and transparent staff selection procedures and improved career opportunities for all ASIS staff; greater mobility for ASIS staff within the Australian Public Service; improved staff counselling; fairer and more transparent procedures for internal investigation of allegations of misconduct; and a clearer and more transparent policy by ASIS of its expectations of the spouses of ASIS officers, particularly in relation to operational work and internal investigations. The continued secrecy and effectiveness of ASIS's work depends just as much on the maintenance of a culture which promotes and accommodates a diversity of ideas as it does on strict adherence to operational rules and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers many of these changes to be necessary, and is pleased that ASIS has already set about implementing many of them before the Inquiry was completed. The Government intends to pursue these reforms vigorously to ensure they are carried through, and will review periodically ASIS management's performance in this area. This will be necessary to bring ASIS into line with management practice elsewhere in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Protection of Intelligence Sources and Methods</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I have referred above to the importance of maintaining secrecy in ASIS operational matters, and explained the reasons for that secrecy. The Commissioners were asked in their terms of reference to examine whether the measures for protecting secrecy are adequate. They have made some suggestions to improve those measures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Offences</EMPHASIS>. The most important measures available to the Government to prevent and punish the disclosure of sensitive national security information are the official information provisions in the Crimes Act. These provisions were examined as part of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law conducted by The Right Honourable Sir Harry Gibbs AC, which reported to the Government in December 1991. The Government's final consideration of the Gibbs Committee's proposals is awaiting the finalisation of a response to the Report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which was tabled on 30 August 1994. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is firmly of the view that, in the areas of intelligence and security, defence and foreign relations the criminal provisions relating to the disclosure of official information need to be redesigned so as to overcome the problems of imprecision and potential overreach involved in the application of the present Sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act. This view is reflected in the Gibbs Committee recommendations, the general thrust&mdash;although not all the detail&mdash;of which has been endorsed by the ASIS Inquiry Commissioners. The Government agrees with the Commissioners that there should be specifically drafted offences, and proposes that these offences should be incorporated in the Crimes Act as part of the proposed ASIS legislation package. </PARA>
<PARA>The definition of the elements of any criminal offence in this area involves a complex balancing of public interest considerations, in which national security concerns, the effective practical administration of justice and the rights of defendants all have to be weighed. The Government's preferred position, which differs in some respects from the positions of both the Commissioners and the Gibbs Committee, involves the following basic elements:</PARA>
<PARA>.descriptions, as full as possible, of the kinds of disclosures of security information which are prohibited;</PARA>
<PARA>.liability to extend not only to disclosures by members and former members of the intelligence and security services and other relevant officials, but to `secondary' disclosures;</PARA>
<PARA>.the Government to be required to prove damage or likely damage in all cases;</PARA>
<PARA>.illegality under Australian law of an act the subject of a disclosure to be a defence to prosecution; and</PARA>
<PARA>.a presumption that all proceedings to be in camera, subject to the judge being satisfied that no national security interest would be prejudiced by the proceedings, or part of the proceedings in question, being determined in open court. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be seen that, while the Government has preferred a tougher proof of damage test than that recommended by the Commissioners and has allowed a defence of illegality, we do not agree with the Commissioners' proposal to introduce an even broader defence of `public interest'. The establishment of appropriate grievance mechanisms, as outlined below, should make such a defence unnecessary in cases where matters of personnel administration are involved. And, as the Commissioners themselves make clear, any officer with concerns about possible improper activity or serious maladministration has an avenue already through the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for expressing those concerns: certainly there should be no need ever to unlawfully disclose information. </PARA>
<PARA>Nor does the Government propose to defer introduction of the offence of secondary disclosure. The Commissioners' rationale for such a deferral&mdash;namely that we should give the D-Notice system time to work&mdash;does not take account of the fact that the proposed offences would be applicable beyond the recipients of D-Notices. Failure to provide criminal sanctions to secondary disclosures could make the sanctions on primary disclosure quite ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA>As to injunctive action to deal with threatened unlawful disclosures, the Government accepts the Commissioners' recommendations that proof of damage or likely damage should continue to be required in all cases. We would also apply here the presumption in favour of such cases being dealt with in camera, subject to a judicial determination that no national security interest would be prejudiced by not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">D Notices</EMPHASIS>. For the most part, the Government has relied on a system of voluntary restraint on the part of the media to prevent the publication or broadcast of sensitive matters that would harm national security or foreign relations. This system, known as the D Notice system, is voluntary, and is dependent on the goodwill and cooperation of the media for its success. Breaches of the D Notices are not, as such, subject to criminal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners have found that the D Notice system was ineffective in preventing the disclosures on ASIS made in the lead-up to the Inquiry. To some extent the Government could have been more active in promulgating the D Notices and keeping media representatives aware of the Government's concerns. As the disclosures became more serious, the Government did take steps privately to inform the media of its concerns. A review of the D Notice system was under way when the Inquiry began. The Commissioners stress the importance of retaining and reinvigorating the D Notice system, so that the Government will be in a better position to respond to similar contingencies in the future. In line with the recommendations of the Commissioners, the Government will, in consultation with the media, update and reinvigorate the D Notice system so that it will be more effective in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The other reason for the ineffectiveness of the D Notice system was the attitude of the media. It is worth noting here that the Commissioners' assessment of the role of the media in relation to ASIS before and during the Inquiry is not a flattering one. As they note, ASIS makes a good story, precisely because it is shrouded in secrecy. In these circumstances, the media is prone to exaggerate facts, and even experienced and responsible journalists are prone to suspend their powers of judgment and good taste in the pursuit of a good spy story. The Commissioners found that, in some instances, journalists had published allegations about ASIS which they had good reason to suspect were untrue. In some other cases, they made no attempt to verify the accuracy of the claims made to them. I hope the media will take note of these observations. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be an unhappy fact of life at the moment that, if the media sees advantage for itself in running a manifestly national security-sensitive story, its collective instinct is to publish come what may. It is true that, if the media do not understand or accept the underlying need for secrecy, or are unable to distinguish between those disclosures which are likely to be damaging and those which are not, any system of voluntary restraint is likely to have mixed success. This points to the importance of the Government maintaining a continuing consultative dialogue with the media on these issues. The Government and the media will not always share the same view on national security, but they can move towards a better understanding of each others' position, and thereby minimise the chances of causing damage to the national interest. The Government was encouraged by the broad support for the voluntary D Notice system that was expressed by media representatives who appeared before the Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners have suggested that the Government could be more open about ASIS in its public comments. They suggest that the `neither confirm nor deny' approach to questions about ASIS could be modified in some circumstances, and that a complete prohibition on discussion of past ASIS operations may be unnecessary. The Government would prefer the basic rule to remain one of neither confirming nor denying reports and allegations. There may from time to time be instances where it is possible, indeed desirable, to be more forthcoming, e.g. in response to allegations of activities which are clearly proscribed by legislation. But the Government is strongly of the view that the disclosure not only of the identity of individuals, but of the detail of ASIS operations&mdash;past, present or future&mdash;can be damaging to our foreign relations, can compromise operational methods and techniques, and can endanger sources. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Media Liaison</EMPHASIS>. Finally, the Commissioners propose the appointment of an ASIS media liaison officer to assist in helping to develop a better understanding between ASIS and the media. Given the very small likelihood of the Government being able to provide any significant comment on reports and allegations about ASIS, and the enhanced expectations likely accordingly to be disappointed, the Government sees little value in such an appointment. It is, however, anticipated that under the new statutory regime the Director-General of ASIS will have a somewhat higher profile, and be more often available for discussion, than was the case previously. Otherwise, all queries should be directed, as at present, to my office. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Resolution of Grievances and Complaints Relating to ASIS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>As mentioned above, many of the problems that the Commissioners noted in ASIS's management revolved around the question of how to deal with internal dissent and staff grievances. ASIS is not the first government department or agency to experience disharmony or staff difficulties, nor is it likely to be the last. The existence of differences between staff and management in ASIS is not inherently a cause for greater concern than it would be in another organisation. The Commissioners reject the notion that ASIS management has any `special' duty of care towards its employees over and above that owed by any employer to its employees, although they noted the need for ASIS management to take particular measures to meet its duty effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>What is important is that all agencies, including ASIS, have adequate and effective procedures for resolving internal disputes when they do occur, and that these procedures are fair, equitable, and take account of the rights of individuals as well as the needs of the organisation. It is also important, if problems remain after all internal avenues of appeal have been exhausted, that staff have recourse to external review of their grievances.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Internal Mechanisms</EMPHASIS>. In the case of ASIS, the Commissioners have found those mechanisms to be deficient and have made recommendations for improvement. These include fairer procedures for the formation and operation of grievance panels within ASIS and improved staff counselling facilities. The Commissioners also found deficiencies in the procedures for internal investigation of allegations of misconduct. Those deficiencies were found to be a significant factor in the complaints made against ASIS. The Government accepts the need for reform in this area. The Commissioners also recommend clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the ASIS staff ombudsman and the ASIS psychologist. The Commissioners found that the preparation of a secret psychological report on one of the complainants without his knowledge, and the subsequent use of that report, to have been highly improper. These modifications of internal procedures should prevent any repetition of that unfortunate incident. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">External Mechanisms</EMPHASIS>. In line with the preferred practice elsewhere in the public sector, the Commissioners stress the importance of staff grievances being resolved internally wherever possible before avenues of external review are pursued. In the case of ASIS, the failure of internal procedures led to the involvement of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who is responsible for investigating complaints against the intelligence agencies. The former Inspector-General investigated the complaints of the complainants, and in some instances upheld those complaints and made recommendations accordingly. But in many cases the conclusions and recommendations of the Inspector-General were rejected by the complainants, who then chose to pursue their cases through the media, making highly damaging allegations about ASIS operations (a great many of them untrue or highly distorted, or of no relevance to their grievances) in the process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners have made several observations on the handling of these complaints by the former Inspector-General. They have found deficiencies in the procedural approach taken to the investigations and in the time taken to resolve the cases. Some of these problems were caused by procedural constraints dictated by the IGIS Act. Based on these observations, the Commissioners make several recommendations for change to the procedures for external review of ASIS staff grievances. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners recommend that the function of external review of staff grievances be transferred from the Inspector-General to the Security Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which has a determinative power. This would have the advantage of keeping the staff grievance review function on a more detached and adjudicative basis, and would provide for legally binding findings. It would also allow the Inspector-General more time for his agency monitoring function. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's preferred position is for the Inspector-General to retain the grievance function, but for that function to be very clearly delineated from the Inspector-General's other functions; for the Inspector-General to act in a more adjudicative manner in relation to staff grievances; and for the Inspector-General to be given a determinative power. We believe this approach is more consistent with the role envisaged by Mr Justice Hope for the Inspector-General. The deficiencies that arose in the cases of the complainants arose not because of the involvement of the Inspector-General per se, but because of the constraints under which the Inspector-General operated, some limitations in the mode of operation he adopted and the refusal of some of the complainants to accept his conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees with the Commissioners that a move to a more adjudicative process for resolving grievances is necessary, but considers this role should be performed by the Inspector-General, who already possesses the statutory power to do so, rather than the AAT. The Inspector-General already has the flexibility to adopt more adjudicative processes in those grievances where it is appropriate, and has experience and knowledge of the workings of ASIS which will both assist, and be assisted by continued involvement with grievances. The Government has never envisaged a role for the AAT in the resolution of staff grievances within the intelligence community, and believes such a role is more appropriately performed by the Inspector-General, operating under modified procedures, and with a limited determinative power in relation to compensation and reinstatement following unfair dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA>I also note that on 6 April 1995 Mr Ron McLeod took up the position of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. He is a senior public servant with particular depth of experience in defence and public administration. He was formerly Deputy Secretary, Budget and Management, in the Department of Defence and, more recently, headed the team that reviewed the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Complainants</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>It is appropriate to comment at this point on the findings of the Commissioners in relation to the complainants. As I have indicated, the second volume of the classified Report will not be tabled, for reasons of national security and privacy. However, the Commissioners make some comment on the cases in their summary Report, which has already been tabled. They note that there had been significant shortcomings in the treatment of two former officers and the wife of one of those former officers by ASIS management. The Commissioners also found that the wife of one of the former officers is entitled to an apology from ASIS for the stress and hurt caused by her treatment. The Government accepts these findings. In fairness to ASIS management, it needs to be pointed out that to the extent that ASIS's actions with regard to the complainants were found to be deficient, those actions were influenced by ASIS's legitimate concern with secrecy and not motivated by malice. This, of course, does not justify those actions, nor does it ease the suffering of those who were affected. The Director-General of ASIS will make a formal apology to the wife of the former officer, and I join with him in this apology. </PARA>
<PARA>Set against these findings, the Commissioners also found that the complainants had no justification whatsoever for their disclosures of sensitive information about ASIS, in view of the solemn and binding commitments of confidentiality they had given. The complainants have put forward the argument that they had no alternative but to make the disclosures they did in order to have their cases heard. This is not true. Despite procedural flaws in the former Inspector-General's handling of some of the cases, his conclusions and recommendations were nevertheless reasonable. The Government cannot be held to account for the complainants' refusal to accept those conclusions. Nor can the disclosures or purported disclosures of sensitive details of ASIS operations, in clear breach of confidentiality undertakings, in any way be excused. In any case, the former officers' grievances concerned deficiencies in administration rather than operations. Finally, there can be no justification, under any circumstances, under any definition of public interest, for making allegations which are known to be untrue. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioners suggested that, in relation to three of the complainants, considerations of general justice and fairness might warrant an award of compensation, although they also note that the amount of any compensation should be discounted to some degree by the complainants' breaches of confidentiality. The Commissioners made a more specific recommendation in relation to a fourth complainant. The Commissioners judged that it was not within their terms of reference to recommend an amount of compensation to the first three complainants. Therefore, the Government has agreed to set up a process of arbitration to make binding determinations on compensation and other issues arising from the complainants cases. That arbitration process will begin soon, and we expect it to be finalised as quickly as possible. Once that is done, the Government hopes to close the book once and for all on these cases. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>As will be apparent from the Report that I am now tabling, many of the public allegations that have been levelled against ASIS&mdash;such as rogue activities or bumbling incompetence&mdash;are simply not borne out by the facts. ASIS does well the job it was established to do, and is firmly under the control of the Government. The arrangements for its accountability are effective. The Commissioners have made suggestions for enhancing and widening the arrangements for accountability&mdash;not as a response to disorder, but as improvements to already satisfactory arrangements which are warranted by changed circumstances. The Government broadly accepts these proposals as positive and useful. </PARA>
<PARA>ASIS is well-managed in the performance of its primary task. But its internal organisation and management has at times in the past experienced problems as a result of an internal culture that places a high premium on secrecy and loyalty. These problems unfortunately led in some cases to the inappropriate treatment of some individuals. Those events were unfortunate for all concerned and I do not seek to justify them. </PARA>
<PARA>Steps are in hand to change management practices as a matter of priority, including changes to the arrangements for internal review of grievances. There is every indication that the current ASIS management at the most senior levels recognises the need for change and has already embarked on that path. Improvements to the mechanisms for external review of ASIS staff grievances, including the role of the Inspector-General, are also in hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Government reaffirms the need for secrecy in ASIS's activities, and will take the necessary steps to improve its ability to deter and prevent, in the national interest, the disclosure of sensitive details of ASIS operations. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We listened to you; you listen to us. In recent times the management of intelligence matters in this country has been a national embarrassment. What we have been reading in the press in the last week or two has been a national disgrace. It has embarrassed all Australians.

I am in the comfortable position, I readily concede, where I do not know whether any of these allegations are true or false, but goodness knows what the attitude of the government of the United States or the government of the United Kingdom must be when they read the sorts of statements that have appeared in the press in this country in the last week or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is elementary that, in intelligence matters, reciprocation requires that secrets be kept secret. If there is a failure&mdash;or an almost total breakdown as is being alleged here&mdash;of that security structure, it is highly embarrassing for this country and for all Australians. The government must take responsibility for it. There is no-one else who takes responsibility for it. Whether it is the systems that are put in place, the administration of those systems, the structure of the D-notices, or whatever the detail may be, if it fails and it embarrasses this country it is the government that must take responsibility. If it relates to  ASIS it is the foreign minister who must take responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is astonishing that, despite the fact that ministers say, `We will neither confirm nor deny', two ministers have been quite ready to enter into this debate. Extraordinarily, when the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, was in Manila he said, `I cannot comment on these security matters', but then decided he would weigh into the debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that perhaps he is a minister of less experience than the foreign minister, but the foreign minister did it in this chamber in answer to a dorothy dixer.

But then he said, `In general terms, there are a few things I would like to say about it: I can assure you that, if we have security arrangements with the United States, we get all the information, and there is no information that we do not have access to.' So he contributed to the debate as to what is&mdash;or what may be&mdash;the security arrangements between Australia and other countries.

That gives him, although everyone now likes to dismiss it, a special responsibility and a special onus in relation to those staff. The compensation was offered under threat, and for it to be offered under threat in circumstances where an officer does not have the usual recourse to the courts that other members of the public have was simply disgraceful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal briefly with the ministerial statement. I will make some introductory comments then get to the heart of the matter which, as Senator Hill pointed out, is the government's accountability and responsibility in this matter. Then I want to say something about the public Samuels report, then deal with the minister's tabling statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I would like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) on this report. It is a very well structured report and is very well put together. A fair bit of thought has been put into it. I do not agree with all of it and I will come to some of those points later. At the end of the day, we have to come to the conclusion, though, that this is a political report, designed to protect the government's back and to deflect criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it certainly makes some positive contributions to the debate on how the Australian intelligence community can be handled. That matter has been of great concern to me over a large number of years, particularly the facet that relates to parliamentary accountability of these agencies. I have certainly changed my thinking over the years I have been in this place from an initial view that the parliament, as part of the Westminster system&mdash;unlike the American system&mdash;could not become involved in the affairs of the agencies in an effective way. I now believe there is a limited role for the parliament in an oversight capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the need for the intelligence community. I do not believe that the world is an ideal place and we can live in splendid isolation and cherish our ideals. It is important that we know what is going on in the nations of our region&mdash;what they are up to. Every other country does it although that is no justification for the requirement to exist in the first place. It is essential for the long-term national security of the country that we have an effective security service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really wonder whether there is a case today to have a secret intelligence service like ASIS, since every country collects intelligence and some countries do not have an official secrets act. If there is no official secrets act, there are no secrets to hide. I do not see why we cannot be quite open about a lot of the activities that ASIS performs. I would be prepared to consider a different title for the organisation&mdash;but that is a bit of a red herring at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make about ASIS is that, to the best of my knowledge, it does a good job operationally. It is certainly not perfect and a few quite comical blunders have emerged in public in the last decade. But I have no hesitation in supporting the quality of the product it is producing and its operations in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the heart of the problem we are dealing with is the internal administration of ASIS, what is frequently and colloquially referred to as man management. The way it handles its staff obviously is quite appalling and indefensible. A secondary matter in this issue is the culture within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the great and long-term antipathy it has to members of the intelligence community and members of the Defence Force. In one of the instances, the problem arose basically because of the antipathy of a member of the foreign affairs department. He was running stories about a member of ASIS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. The criticism of the government does not relate to secrecy. The operational side of ASIS is not in dispute. What we are talking about is something which can and must be exposed to the light of public scrutiny. We are dealing with how the careers and lives of members of ASIS are handled by their administrators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, this matter arose because a small number of the staff of ASIS were genuinely badly treated. They felt they had no escape valve. As to whether they were justified in going public, I simply do not have enough information to make that judgment. But on the information I have, and as I see it, I would agree with the minister that there was no justification for them to go public on any operational matter whatsoever&mdash;and I deplore that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that leaves us with the matter of dealing with the clear failures within the ASIS administration. The responsibility for that rests with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When the administration within ASIS was so bad that they had no other outlet, when they had been failed by the Inspector-General in the discharge of his duty to deal with their grievances and when the minister was made aware of it, the minister had an absolutely unavoidable obligation to do something. Yet the minister did nothing. He received a letter from the Director-General. Earlier this week, when I asked him how many letters of such a nature he had ever received from the Director-General of ASIS, he admitted, `Well, this was the only one.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an extraordinary circumstance that the Director-General should write to his minister. In essence, what he said to the minister was, `We have a major problem here and the only way we can defuse it is by holding an inquiry that is divorced from the department, so it is seen to be objective. If we do that, we may be able to close the situation down and do no damage. If it is not done, then there are great risks to national security.' The minister cavalierly dismissed that letter. He dissembled later and said, `Well, I was thinking about it all along.' Obviously, at the time, the minister thought he would hide behind the traditional shield and buttress of ministers in relation to security matters and take the view that he would not comment&mdash;neither confirm nor deny&mdash;but that did not work in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the tragedy that we have at the present time. We have careers and lives ruined. We have national security put at risk. You cannot quantify the damage that has been done to Australia's national interests because we have offended everyone in the international community. We have offended our friends. We have offended our enemies. We have offended those who are neutral to our position. We have been caught out in the most appalling way by the consequences of the minister not dealing responsibly with this situation. Believe me, we have not seen the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Samuels report points out, some of these events go back 10 years. The way the whole thing has been handled will lead to a lot more agents, regrettably, coming out and running stories. Whether they are true or false, it will not matter, but they will be very damaging to Australia's reputation. As Senator Hill said, we have agreements with other powers in relation to the exchange of intelligence information. There has always been great suspicion in the United States and the United Kingdom about the security forces in Australia under a Labor government. They have had their worst fears amplified and reinforced by the events of the last few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the nations in the region are offended. They are people of great tact and sensibility. They are all offended by the bugging of the Chinese embassy and things like that. To turn around and say, as Senator Evans is trying to say, that other departments in other countries have faults is irrelevant. Senator, two wrongs do not make a right, and I am sorry you do not know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the irresponsibility of this minister, the dereliction of the responsibilities vested in him, that led to the avoidable mess that we are in today. It has seen careers destroyed, lives put under great stress, cost the Commonwealth I do not know how many tens of millions of dollars, and put the whole of our international relations at risk as a consequence of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to turn briefly to the Samuels report and make a few points. The very first page of the Samuels report&mdash;I am talking about the report that was released a month or so ago to the public&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collection of such secret material depends on people who often put their lives and liberties at considerable risk.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the first points. The government has a responsibility to these people because they are different from the public servants sitting in the safety of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade buildings whose lives are not put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make about the Samuels report is that it sets out to damn those who made the complaints&mdash;the complainants, as the minister calls them. At every opportunity within this public document the people who complain are damned and given no tolerance or understanding in any way. There is absolutely no blame attributed to the press. Anyone in this building knows very well that when you talk to the press, what you say may or may not be presented accurately. I simply do not know, because I do not know what these officers said to the press. I do know what appeared in the press. Some of those things were pretty colourful. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although information published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program on operational matters was skewed towards the false, evidence presented to us of action and reaction in other countries satisfies us that the publication was damaging.</PARA>
<PARA>The implication of that statement, apart from the international consequences of it, is that the information from complainants that appeared in public was false. There is a comment on the next page, `by publishing what they were told'. The implication there was that the press was accurate. I am not sure about that. Towards the end of the minister's statement he comments about something that does not appear in the public Samuels report. On page 12 of the typescript of his report he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioners found that, in some instances, journalists had published allegations about ASIS which they had good reason to suspect were untrue.</PARA>
<PARA>It may be that in the original Samuels report there was a more objective view taken of the quality of the reports that appeared in public. Maybe what we are dealing with in this public report of Samuels is a political document that was written in the minister's office that tried to put a favourable spin on it for the government. I do not know that; we just do not have that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal briefly with the two complaints. The first case deals at length with a psychological report. The report apparently was compiled by an unregistered psychologist. The first thing that happened was that it was not done with informed consent. In other words, the subject was not told he was the subject of a psychological report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing about it seems to be that it was done on the run. It was not done as part of a formal clinical assessment. It was done at a casual social meeting, an interview or a series of interviews in the office. That is a gross breach of medical ethics. You cannot do those things. Psychiatrists and psychologists do not analyse people on superficial contact. There is a formal clinical assessment process. If this person had been a registered psychologist, he certainly would have been deregistered, struck off the register for an act like that. It was an appalling breach of medical ethics. Samuels finds that on page 7 of his report. On several occasions he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We consider that this use of the report, however it occurred and whatever the intended purpose, was highly inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a gross understatement. This report was used against one of the officers&mdash;an illegally gathered and probably quite inaccurate psychological assessment. That is the stuff that the Soviet secret police used against the enemies of the state. It is an absolutely unconscionable action. This happened in Australia. It happened in a department and in an organisation responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is the sort of tactics that got the Soviet psychological association expelled from the world body. It is absolutely unheard of that techniques like that should be used in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the Samuels inquiry found that, while the first complainant had been very badly treated, he had no justification to go public with his complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second case, the original complaints against this officer were initiated by an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The complaints were directed against him and his wife. His wife was not an employee of the Commonwealth; she was a wife. She was not in any way responsible or answerable to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report, as the Samuels inquiry found, was based upon little more than `unauthenticated gossip'. In other words, a senior officer of ASIS and his wife were subjected to an attack on the basis of what Samuels described as unauthenticated gossip. When the officer who made those charges was asked at the Samuels inquiry to sign a statement, he refused to do so. The person who made that unauthenticated gossip refused to sign the document at the inquiry when the evidence was presented to him of what he had said about this officer and his wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the rules of evidence and all the processes of the Australian law were denied to that officer. He had no human rights bill, no civil or political rights and no privacy act to protect him. Some of those legal recourses are denied to him because of the fact that he was an officer of ASIS. They were not denied to his wife, legally; but in reality they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the Samuels inquiry is the implication that the officers had received generous compensation. My advice is that they were offered something like $10,000 or $12,000 compensation plus a year's salary. What we are dealing with here are officers who are highly specialised, who put their lives at risk from time to time in the interest of the nation, who serve overseas and who do tasks for which there are no civilian counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no advertisements&mdash;however hard we look on a Saturday morning in the positions vacant of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;for retired or resigned ASIS officers. They cannot go up to an employer after 15, 20 or 25 years service, ask for a job and present a CV of their activities. They are specialists and the country has an obligation to them. To suggest that $10,000 or $12,000 is compensation for someone who has been driven out of the service as a consequence of unauthenticated gossip or of a bodgie psychological report is absolutely absurd and indefensible, yet this is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety valve that should have existed for these officers with their grievance was the Inspector-General. For a variety of reasons, the Inspector-General was the light that failed. It was not only his own fault, but his own lack of abilities obviously contributed to an inability to solve the difficulties. As a consequence, the Director-General wrote to the minister, and we all know that the minister did nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the minister goes on to praise the new appointee. I know the new Inspector-General. I have known him for 15 or 16 years in the parliament. While I have the greatest of respect for him, his knowledge of operations in the intelligence field would be quite negligible and the ability to bring mature judgment on difficult issues like this would also be non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go on to the minister's response itself. I do not wish to re-cover what I have talked about in relation to the complainants. I do wish to deal with the matter of a parliamentary committee. I said at the outset that parliamentary oversight is something we have to turn our minds to. I agree with the recommendation that it should be a small  committee. This paper suggests that the committee should have six members. I would be quite happy with four&mdash;two from the government and two from the opposition, with the chairman being a government nominee with a casting and a deliberative vote. I certainly believe the committee should not be larger than six. It should include senior parliamentarians who have some knowledge and interest in the field and who can bring some judgment to bear on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the critical points, though, is that the members of the committee should be selected by the Leader of the Government, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I do not believe it should be a matter for ballot within the party room. It is not a popularity contest, and the people who hold a committee appointment must be people of some experience who are able to bring some abilities to the task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very conscious of the shortcomings of the ASIO joint committee. I was the second Liberal member to serve on that committee, and that committee is a sham. It is a sham put up by the Labor Party as a sop to its left wing. When I was on that committee, the chairman of the committee was compromised, in the intelligence sense, to the Soviets. I know the Prime Minister of the day knew that, and I know at least one of his senior cabinet ministers in the House of Representatives knew that, and I suspect a large number did. For a government to put in as chairman of that committee a person who was compromised is absolutely inexcusable. The rest of the nominees of the Labor Party on that committee ranged from the loony left through the academic left to the harmless left. There was no other group from the Labor Party on the committee at that time, and the committee was a sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion I would make about an intelligence committee for the parliament is that it should have a finite term. The members probably should be appointed for three or four years, and they should be out of phase, 50 per cent retiring at a time, so that there is some continuity. It is very important that people do not serve for a lifetime on the intelligence committee, because they become captive of the organisations. A finite period of three to four years&mdash;the way the Americans do it&mdash;is absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister discussed the organisation and management of ASIS. Since time is short, I do not propose to go into that in great detail, but the statement he made&mdash;that the situation we have at present `led to the development of a culture which values conformity above diversity and executive direction over consultation'&mdash;is perfectly true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to inject within the management of ASIS itself some external points of view, and that is quite different to a parliamentary committee. Maybe it is possible to bring people in from outside&mdash;and I do think there are Australians in industry at senior management levels who would be prepared to serve and who could profitably serve in an advisory management committee and bring a different perspective to what is necessarily an always inward-looking culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to take any more time discussing the protection of intelligence sources and methods, which takes some pages here, or go on for too long about the resolutions of grievances and complaints. That really does need to be addressed, and probably the propositions made by the department can be made to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I do support the need for the intelligence community. It works under enormous difficulties and it always must operate under difficulties because of the very nature of its work. On the evidence I have, and from what I have seen over the years, I think ASIS does a good job in the field. It clearly has problems, though, with its internal management, and the government must accept the responsibility for that. What we have seen from the minister at the present time is a total rejection of that responsibility. That is something that the parliament cannot tolerate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues in their criticism of the government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in the handling of this matter relating to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. I share the comments of my colleague Senator MacGibbon with regard to welcoming the government's response. It is a very important report. I particularly welcome the government's intention to move ASIS from an executive to a legislative charter&mdash;I am sure that is a very important move&mdash;and also to set up the parliamentary oversight committee. I also note in the minister's statement that ASIS exempt operating accounts will be opened up to external audit by the audit office, and I welcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart of the matter and why we are talking about this matter today really comes from the grievances that were raised by several ex-ASIS officers and one wife which brought this whole matter to a head. As Senator MacGibbon said before me, it really showed incompetent management within ASIS, within its external review for complaints&mdash;that is, the Inspector-General's role&mdash;and basically incompetence by the minister in handling this whole matter. The report clearly shows that there have to be substantial changes, not only the external ones relating to legislative matters and parliamentary oversight, but also the internal management procedures. I will come to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the grievances led to this substantial review of ASIS, which would not have happened without the people being forced to go public.

What would the foreign minister have done if he had been in their situation? The five people followed through proper procedure within the organisation. They were frustrated by that procedure within the service. They then referred their concerns to the Inspector-General. He went laboriously through the process. In one case negotiations with him went on for 3 1/2 years, but in the end it broke down; it did not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people concerned then approached the foreign minister. I understand that one or two of them approached him personally. Then they made a plea through Miles Cooper, the minister's senior adviser, for the minister to sit down and talk with them&mdash;either individually or as a group&mdash;but he refused. They then wrote to the minister about this matter, asking him to look at it again. One of them wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Again, they were frustrated; nothing happened. What else would you expect them to do, having gone through all this frustration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people had a genuine concern for Australia. They were not like agent Ames in the USA who went across to the other side because he believed he had been wrongly treated. These people did not do that; they loved Australia, they believed there was improper management within the organisation and they wanted the matter exposed and corrected. Unfortunately, through this minister they came to the conclusion that they had to expose it in the public arena in order to get it corrected. We are seeing here today that the commissioners did recommend that management had to be substantially changed. So their major complaints have been recognised. I hope that the government treats them fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator MacGibbon mentioned a few minutes ago, we also know that the Director-General of ASIS advised the minister to have an inquiry and that he refused to do so at the time.

I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>of 22 February in which he answered a question from Senator Troeth with regard to why the government had not decided to establish a proper inquiry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the key points about that in the minister's statement. He says that the commissioners propose a number of management reforms aimed at developing an internal culture which respects differences and diversities between staff and management as being healthy rather than threatening. They propose a greater emphasis on corporate planning, a greater delegation of functions, more uniform and transparent staff selection procedures, improved career opportunities, improved staff counselling, fairer and more transparent procedures for the internal investigation of allegations of misconduct and a clearer and more transparent policy by ASIS of expectations of the spouses of officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is not that an indictment of the management of this organisation? It really is. For a public report to come out and for the minister to come out and say what has to be done about an organisation makes me understand in some way why these people who have been aggrieved for so many years took the step and, in effect, forced this inquiry. The good thing for all Australians is that we are seeing a positive response from the government in, first of all, going down the legislative route, admitting the parliamentary oversight, providing the Auditor-General with access to accounts which were previously closed off to him and, probably more importantly, making all those key points about the management of the organisation that I have just referred to from the minister's own statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the Australian Secret Intelligence Service</EMPHASIS>. I would like to make a few comments because I find this report an incredible indictment on the efficiency, or lack of it, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). The responsibility of the minister is quite clearly outlined on page 12 of the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibility assigned by the Directive to the Minister for Foreign Affairs makes the Minister the most important element in the control and accountability of ASIS. The Minister bears the political responsibility for what the Service does. The effectiveness of the control and accountability of ASIS depends crucially on the competence of both the Minister and the Director-General and the trust between them.</PARA>
<PARA>You could have bluffed me! Having listened to this statement by the minister today, I agree exactly with what Senator Hill said earlier on&mdash;that is, it is incredible, it is breathtaking to think that the minister has blamed everybody but himself. He has failed the test in the worst possible way by neglecting his staff; by neglecting their concerns, their complaints and their genuine questions on matters that have been raised by me and many other colleagues over an extended period of time. Had the minister half a wit about him or any concern for such an important service as ASIS, he would have taken on board the serious questions that were being raised at estimates and in the parliament. He chose not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, the former Director-General has also been negligent in his role as detailed in the report as he is personally responsible for the individual and collective performance of officers. Quite clearly the concerns and complaints raised by officers have been overlooked by many of these people. The report indicates too that complaints raised by personnel had some foundation. The use of an unofficially obtained psychological report on one of the complainants is just disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech the minister said that briefings given to the opposition should remain strictly confidential in order to protect national security. Following my repeated questions to the minister at estimates, he kindly offered me a briefing. I had that briefing, and I have kept everything absolutely confidential&mdash;I might say, though, with great difficulty at times because some of the media reports clearly knew what I knew, and some of the journalists clearly knew what I had been told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs is like the Attorney-General, Minister Lavarch: there is no acceptance or acknowledgment whatsoever of the decent role that the opposition plays in this exercise. Minister Lavarch has never acknowledged what Senator Vanstone did last year with the truckload of information that came from the Attorney-General's Department. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has never acknowledged the fact that we in the opposition have sought to keep these matters confidential, even in the light of the fact that he has made a huge botch-up of the whole thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that virtually all the officers at the centre of the problem were either not informed about allegations or were not given any answers to concerns is a great worry to me. The fact that the officers were denied any opportunity to see a report such as the illegally and unofficially obtained psychological report is even more scandalous and an atrocious reflection on both the minister and the director-general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the minister should have realised that those questions over an extended period of time would lead to some trouble. The fact that the minister today, at the very beginning of his speech, said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had been considering in 1993, well before any individual grievances became public, whether it was time for another review of ASIS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>is also breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister knew in 1993 that there were problems afoot but he chose to ignore them&mdash;he chose to deflect them willy-nilly to his officers. While we cannot condone officers and former officers raising their concerns publicly, the fact that they did indicates, in the clearest possible terms, that their concerns were falling on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officers wrote to the minister with no response&mdash;no response! Is that not a neglect of duty? Of course, it is. Let us never forget where the buck stops&mdash;with this minister, Senator Evans. He failed every test set for him in the resolution of so many problems. The mere fact that there is a belief in the service that to raise a complaint is to put one's future at risk is a further indictment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It never ceases to amaze me that there are examples after examples of the fact that the government's loud and long trumpeting about workplace conditions, equality, fairness and justice is simply ignored or overridden by ministers when it so suits. There was no fairness, no equality, no justice at all in the treatment of these officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of ASIS, I am the first to admit that staff should, in the first instance, be able to obtain satisfaction from the Inspector-General. However, when that fails, surely there should be a level of responsibility accepted and exercised by the minister. I repeat: this minister chose not to do it and he should stand condemned for not doing it. It is preposterous for the minister to suggest he had no idea of the situation before that time in 1994. In his response today, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed with the Commissioners' recommendation that the complainants and their legal representatives be allowed to see those parts of the second volume which relate to their individual cases, on conditions of strict confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA>So they should be. But it is all too late. He shut the door in those officers' faces time and time again. Now, to make a big fellow of himself, he is saying, `Oh, you can have a look at the report.' They should be allowed to see it. They should have known what was going on. They should have been privy to the information about themselves long ago. This minister should have seen to it but he chose not to. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASIS is an arm of the executive government, and is subject to Ministerial direction like any other department or agency of government.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the minister's own words. Well, you could have fooled me! He has walked away from everything that is wrong, everything that is bad, everything that has affected the officers, and he is consistently blaming other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant factor is that the minister admitted today that the commissioners did find that there had been some shortcomings in ASIS's internal management, particularly with regard to the methods it adopted to deal with allegations of misconduct. Since the minister knew of those allegations, why did he not direct that there be a smart resolution so that the whole situation would not go public? We would not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, we would not have had Senator McMullan talking out about it, we would not have the minister himself coming into the chamber and flapping his gums on it, in a most inappropriate way, if he had taken proper action at an early stage. Today he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of appropriate grievance mechanism, as outlined . . . should make such a defence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a defence of public interest, I might add&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unnecessary in cases where matters of personnel administration are involved. And, as the Commissioners themselves make clear, any officer with concerns about possible improper activity or serious maladministration has an avenue already through the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for expressing those concerns: certainly there should be no need ever to unlawfully disclose information.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true. That method of expressing concern should be available&mdash;that is, if it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not work in this case. The minister saw to it that it did not work. I deliberately say that because the minister knew that there were problems. If he wanted to ensure that it worked, he could have. He went on to say in relation to the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to ASIS:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of differences between staff and management in ASIS is not inherently a cause for greater concern than it would be in another organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is. By the sheer nature of ASIS, it is of great concern because if people act in desperation&mdash;and I say desperation because that is the way in which these officers acted&mdash;they are going to make these things public. They are going to have to make these things public. So there is a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should recognise the difference between ASIS and other instrumentalities. The minister also admits that the commissioners `noted the need for ASIS management to take particular measures to meet its duty effectively'. Is that an admission, or not, of the fact that there were shortcomings? The minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioners also recommended clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the ASIS staff ombudsman and the ASIS psychologist.</PARA>
<PARA>So say all of us after what happened with this exercise. The minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioners found that the preparation of a secret psychological report on one of the complainants without his knowledge, and the subsequent use of that report, to have been highly improper.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that not interesting? There is no indication whatsoever in this statement that the minister has accepted that that psychological report should not have been done and that he, in the end, takes responsibility for the fact that it was and that the information was never conveyed to the person. The person was never notified that any report was conducted on him at the time. The minister does not accept one shred of responsibility. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in many cases the conclusions and recommendations of the Inspector-General were rejected by the complainants, who then chose to pursue their cased through the media.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, that is right. Having spoken to a number of these complainants over a long period of time, I am not surprised. The amount of contact that they have had with ASIS management and with the minister&mdash;all to no avail&mdash;was appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not condone going public, particularly when one is subjected to the conditions applying to ASIS officers. But surely that is all the more reason why the minister must take responsible action. The minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioners have made several observations on the handling of these complaints by the former Inspector-General and they have found deficiencies in the procedural approach taken to the investigations and the time to resolve the cases.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister has noted that that has been a problem. I ask the question again: did he do anything about it? The simple answer is no. He chose not to do anything about it. I think the minister should be absolutely and utterly condemned in this place for his inactivity and his inattention to his job as minister. The buck does stop with him. A number of ASIS officers and a wife have been seriously aggrieved by this process and lack of concern by the minister for which this report clearly identifies he has the responsibility. At some stage this minister must accept responsibility and not wash his hands of everything coming under his control when it goes wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article by Ian Hamilton in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> concerns the removal of the savings provision for saved managed investments; that is, market-linked managed investments bought before 8 September 1988, and friendly society bonds bought before 1 January 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help bring in the extended deeming provisions, the government will be giving a massive concession to people with these investments. This is not to encourage or force pensioners to change their investments but to remove barriers to them doing so. It will allow pensioners to change investments before extended deeming starts, if they wish, without their pension being badly affected by the old on-realisation rules for saved managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, if these managed investments are cashed in, a person's pension may be considerably reduced because past capital growth is assessed in one 12-month period following withdrawal. Persons may lose their entire pension for a year under this rule. To help bring in the new rules, the government is going to drop this rule from the time the necessary legislation is passed. This is a generous concession which means that past growth accumulated on these investments will never be counted under the income test. It is not just a window of opportunity before extended deeming starts; the rule will be dropped forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners are being advised of the arrangements which will be put in place for these investments in the June edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS>. It will make clear that if people reinvest money from a saved managed investment before extended deeming starts, their new investment will be subject to the current income test rules until July 1996. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS> will also make clear that people should not rush into decisions about changing investments and that they may wish to use the DSS financial information service, or their own financial advisers, to get information and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements for saved managed investments are an essential part of the move to a fairer and simpler system of means testing. The complexities caused by the savings provisions were a major barrier to simplifying the means test. Removing these savings provisions allows the range of complex rules for the assessment of financial investments to be replaced with one simple and fair set of income test rules.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Seventh report of 1995 relates to the proposed construction of a multi-level carpark for the Federal Airports Corporation at Melbourne Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Melbourne Airport is the second busiest in Australia and is subject to continuing growth in passenger movements. The existing short-term carpark is suffering severe congestion and frequent closure. The Federal Airports Corporation submitted to the Committee that it is necessary to increase the capacity of the short-term carpark by providing a multi-level carpark adjacent to the terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of the proposal examined by the Committee includes a four-level, open-sided concrete carpark.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also includes&mdash;associated facilities such as office accommodation for car rental companies and police, accommodation for some high vehicles, lifts, stairs, pedestrian bridges, goods loading dock, landscaping and planting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preliminary cost estimate of the project is $55 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that current short-term carparking facilities and arrangements at Melbourne Airport are inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to upgrade short-term carparking to overcome current shortages and provide for future growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to a suggestion from the Public Transport Users Association that improved public transport from the airport to the city may obviate the need for a new building, the Committee found that the majority of motor vehicles requiring short-term parking emanate from the wider metropolitan area and other parts of the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes nevertheless that options for a longer term future rail link to the Central Business District have been identified and easements are being protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the new carpark will be some distance from the terminal building and will be linked by three walkways, the Committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should consider the provision of mechanical moving walkways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A substantial building site between the terminal and the carpark has been reserved for a future hotel. The Committee has some misgivings about the suitability and practicality of locating a hotel between the terminal and the carpark. Accordingly the Committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should re-examine the arrangement of carpark and future hotel sites to satisfy itself that the proposed sites are the best locations for both.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two features of the carpark include a loading dock and tunnel which it is planned will facilitate the movement of goods to and from the terminal. Qantas raised a number of concerns about the tunnel and the loading dock and the Committee has recommended that during the development of detailed designs the Federal Airports Corporation should continue discussions with Qantas and other terminal users about the functionality of the loading dock and tunnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same vein, in response to a submission from the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board, the Committee has recommended that the FAC should, during design development, consult the brigade about modifications to State regulatory fire safety requirements before they are submitted to the Building Appeals Board for approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Eighth Report of 1995 deals with a proposed housing development at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS>, Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee involves the construction of 32 family dwellings by the Defence Housing Authority on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS>. The site for the proposed housing is adjacent to existing family units which have been completed over the past two years. Upon completion the new houses will be allocated to families of Army non-commissioned and commissioned officers. Included in the project are supporting community facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposed work is $6.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that as a consequence of the Army Presence in the North project there will be a need for a continuing program of housing acquisitions or Defence Housing Authority-sponsored new construction to be provided in Darwin to cater for planned relocation of Defence personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that in order to reduce reliance on Temporary Rental Allowances and to avoid over-reliance on acquisitions, there is merit in the Defence Housing Authority proceeding with the funding and development of new construction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory Government pointed out to the Committee that the site proposed for the housing development is prone to noise from a number of sources, including aircraft, speedway racing and road traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is not convinced that a housing subdivision situated in close proximity to two major roads and within a short distance from a speedway and underneath an aircraft flight path, will not have substantial noise problems either now or in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised these concerns with the Defence Housing Authority and has approved the proposal only on the assurance by DHA that whilst recognising the potential disadvantages, they are outweighed by the advantages. The Committee remains to be convinced of this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also raised concerns about the close proximity of the houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised the question of the payment of subcontractors with the Defence Housing Authority. The Defence Housing Authority is considering making it mandatory for builders to certify that these payments have been made. The Committee believes this is an urgent matter and has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority should move swiftly to make it a mandatory requirement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill together with the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill 1995 gives effect to the Statement on Superannuation Policy made by the Treasurer on 28 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer's statement confirms the Government's vision for superannuation. It strengthens the existing superannuation system to ensure that it works more equitably for everyone&mdash;particularly people with small superannuation accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small superannuation accounts are inevitable. After all most new employees begin with a small entitlement to contributions. This is particularly the case for casual, itinerant and part time workers such as hospitality staff and fruit pickers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with small accounts is that the fees and charges imposed on them can be more than the investment income earned. Clearly this contributes nothing to retirement savings and is not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is implementing a range of measures to deal with this problem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.`member protection' of small superannuation accounts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.measures to reduce the number of multiple accounts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve established by this bill; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.other initiatives including measures contained in the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together, these measures will ensure that compulsory superannuation contributions add greatly to national savings in the years to come and will help ensure higher retirement incomes for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Member Protection</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation funds will be asked to `member protect' accounts by taking steps to prevent fees and charges from totalling more than investment income. Member protection will apply to any superannuation account under $1,000 which contains Superannuation Guarantee or award superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been promoting member protection as its preferred approach to dealing with the small balances problem. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Australian Taxation Office has written to all funds, financial advisers, trustees and employers, to explain the new rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the member protection rules were contained in Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations gazetted on 5 April 1995. These measures supplement existing regulations relating to the vesting of member benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing multiple superannuation accounts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the area of reducing multiple superannuation accounts, the Government encourages people to transfer all their superannuation into one account. This will result in larger balances which are less likely to be lost or eroded by fees. It will also mean that funds have fewer small balances to member protect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, we asked the superannuation industry to establish a low cost `transfer protocol' for transferring benefits between funds. This should make it easier for people to transfer all of their superannuation to the fund used by their current employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `transfer protocol' will reduce costs throughout the industry, particularly for the major industry fund administrators which cater to over 3.5 million industry fund members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to facilitate a `transfer protocol' by reducing the reporting requirements when benefits are transferred between funds. A high priority will be given to completing the necessary amendments to the Income Tax Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government would prefer to see funds and administrators voluntarily co-operating to ensure that the `transfer protocol' spreads throughout the industry. I understand the major fund administrators are working on a `transfer protocol' which they plan to make available to the industry more broadly. This is a welcome development which I will be monitoring closely. However, the Government will consider the feasibility of making the `transfer protocol' mandatory if this proves necessary in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax Office Collection Mechanism</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill establishes an alternative collection mechanism known as the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve (SHAR) administered by the Australian Taxation Office. SHAR should reduce the number of small superannuation accounts, and the overall costs of administering small accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is encouraging employers to use SHAR as a last resort only where they are unable to contribute to a fund which provides member protection for small balances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers will be able to pay both compulsory and voluntary superannuation contributions into SHAR. There is no limit on the amount that can be paid in. However, income tax deductions for employer contributions will be limited to $1,200 per employee per annum. In addition, employers should not use SHAR where they have award or other obligations to contribute to a particular fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each individual will have their own account which will amalgamate all the amounts paid by different employers. The ATO will write to people when an account has been opened for them explaining how SHAR will work. This information forms part of the Government's ongoing commitment to public education about the benefits of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO will write to people when their balance has reached $1,200 suggesting that they transfer their account to a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Money paid into SHAR may be held in investments authorised under the Audit Act 1901 until the enactment of the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1995. Returns on those investments will be applied firstly to meeting the operating costs of the SHAR. Any remaining surplus will be applied as interest to account balances up to $1,200.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SHAR is designed to operate as a conduit between employers and the superannuation industry, and will not be a superannuation fund for the purposes of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial implications</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of establishing the Reserve is $5.6 million, and annual running costs are estimated at between $7.0 and $7.5 million. These annual running costs are expected to be offset by earnings on the funds held in the Reserve which is anticipated to be administered on a full cost recovery basis.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government has announced that the public share offer for the Commonwealth's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas Airways Ltd will take place in the middle of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Qantas Sale Act 1992, which established the legislative and administrative framework for the sale, received royal assent on 21 December 1992. Consistent with the conditions then prevailing in the aviation industry, the Qantas Sale Act imposed a limit of 35 per cent on the level of foreign ownership of Qantas. This was supported by a limitation on individual foreign holdings of 25 per cent, and a range of national interest provisions ensuring that Qantas' Australian status would be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory national interest provisions require that Qantas be incorporated in Australia, its main operations base and headquarters remain in Australia, and the name of "Qantas" be preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger service. In addition, it is a requirement that the Chairman of Qantas and at least two-thirds of the Board be Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the 1993 amendments, the Air Navigation Act 1920 includes the same national interest provisions as the Qantas Sale Act, and requires that foreign airlines can hold no more than 25 per cent individually and 35 per cent in total of an Australian international airline other than Qantas. However, the Air Navigation Act imposes no overall limitation on holdings by foreigners other than foreign airlines, although if foreign holdings moved above 49 per cent, international carrier status may be challenged by Australia's bilateral aviation partners on the grounds that the carrier may no longer be seen as substantially Australian owned and controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes it is desirable that Qantas should be subject to a similar foreign ownership regime as applies to Ansett and other potential Australian international airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the Government proposes in this bill to increase the overall foreign ownership limit for Qantas from 35 to 49 per cent and to restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than 25 per cent individually and 35 per cent in total of Qantas. The national interest provisions of the Qantas Sale Act would remain unchanged, as would the existing 25 per cent limit on individual holdings of foreigners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that all of its Australian ownership and control objectives for Qantas, as well as obligations under Australia's bilateral aviation treaties, would still be met under a higher foreign ownership limit. Placing Qantas in a similar position as applies to Ansett (and any other emerging Australian international airlines) will have no effect on Qantas' Australian status. That status is protected statutorily by the national interest provisions and the overall foreign ownership limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A consequence of the proposed change in foreign ownership limitations on Qantas is that the sizeable Qantas float would be able to access additional demand from international equity markets.  British Airways already owns 25 of the 35 per cent of Qantas' shares available to foreign investors, and consequently without any change in the overall limit, a maximum of only 10 per cent could be sold to other foreigners. Indications were that under these arrangements there would be substantial unsatisfied offshore demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The participation of foreign investors should therefore assist in attracting full value for the Qantas offer, as the bids of those who routinely value and trade in international airline stocks could be accommodated. This could further the Government's objective of seeking, on behalf of taxpayers, the most successful outcome for the float. The ability of foreigners to participate more fully could also assist in establishing a healthy after market for Qantas' stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interests of taxpayers should be better served if any additional offshore demand is able to be taken into account in establishing a fair and justifiable price for the sale of Qantas. In saying this it has to be recognised that even if substantial foreign demand for Qantas' shares emerges, Australian investors will be allocated more than two thirds of the Government's remaining 75 per cent shareholding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting of the spring sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953, the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992, and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes minor technical amendments to a number of Acts as set out in Schedule 2 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important element of the Government's child care policy is the Commonwealth Childcare Cash Rebate. Introduced in July 1994, this cash payment helps offset child care expenses for children while both parents are, or the sole parent is, working, studying, training or looking for work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parents who are using child care for any of these work-related purposes can claim a rebate on the cost of formal child care services, such as centre-based long day care and family day care, or informal child care, such as care provided by nannies and babysitters. The Childcare Cash Rebate is administered by the Health Insurance Commission (Medicare).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the Childcare Cash Rebate recognises the fact that the cost of the child care is a legitimate work expense for parents in the labour force. It has improved the affordability of child care for many working parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill includes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to ensure consistency with the intentions of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first group of amendments provide hardship provisions to assist certain groups of persons who are currently precluded from receiving the rebate but who should be entitled to the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These groups are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">children over the age of thirteen years who have a disability or other specified special need which requires ongoing child care;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is sought to allow carers under the age of eighteen years who have specified formal child care qualifications to register under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments are proposed to confirm in legislation that family registration is able to be backdated to the date at which the family was first eligible to register, and that the rebate can be paid when a child is absent from child care for specified reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, there are some administrative amendments proposed to rectify a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen and to make consequential amendments to the Act to bring it in line with changes to other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include amendments to allow the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registration is being considered. This will avoid unnecessary recoveries by Government while ensuring that individuals maintain their right to appeal against long-term decisions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the financial impact of these amendments will be minimal, they serve to strengthen the original intention of the Act and to clarify and facilitate certain procedural aspects of the Childcare Cash Rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are designed to correct a number of minor drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which established the Professional Services Review Scheme. In addition, the amendments will allow the appointment as a President of a Professional Services Review Tribunal, a person who holds or has held judicial office in a State or Territory jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professional Services Review Tribunals consider requests from affected practitioners for a review of a Determination of a penalty (which may include the disqualification from Medicare) following a finding by a Professional Services Review Committee that the practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not realised at the time the legislation was drafted that section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act specifies that a reference in any Act to the word "office" shall be construed as a reference to an office in or for the Commonwealth. The proposed amendment corrects this oversight which has limited significantly the number of persons who can be considered for appointment as a Tribunal President.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are designed to correct a deficiency in the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994. That Act, which gave the Health Insurance Commission the power to investigate fraud under Medicare and to deal directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions, does not allow the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized under the authority of a search warrant for more than 60 days unless proceedings for an offence to which that material may afford evidence is instituted within that period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the powers of investigation legislation is modelled in large part on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has pointed out that the provision relating to the retention of seized material was based on a similar provision in an early version of the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994. That latter provision was subsequently altered to allow the retention of evidential material until the reason for its seizure no longer exists or it is decided that it is not to be used in evidence. The proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act provides for the retention of such material in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has advised that, without the proposed amendments, the Commission's search warrant powers are effectively unusable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also empowers the Health Insurance Commission to engage in hedging of investment transactions, provide consulting, management and related services and exercise its powers and perform its functions overseas. The Commission has undertaken a number of consultancies primarily, but not exclusively, under the auspices of the World Bank. As these activities are expanding, and moving beyond the use of spare capacity in the Commission's operations, it is desirable to make explicit provision to cover this activity. The Health Insurance Commission is an Australian organisation at the fore front of international best practice in the performance of its various functions. Its expertise is recognised both within Australia and internationally. The Commission is in a position to perform a flagship role for Australia in areas attracting growing international attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far as the proposed hedging power is concerned, this is consistent with other Commonwealth legislation and has been addressed, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, to resolve any doubt about the Commission's ability to enter into hedging transactions. Hedging is, of course, one of the tools necessary in a prudent and balanced investment program which includes some overseas investments. The Commission operates Medibank Private in competition with other private insurers and must have available to it the same opportunities to manage the funds vested in it by its members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>This Bill also contains amendments to parts of the National Health Act 1953 which regulate the administration of nursing homes. The Government has decided that these amendments should not await the introduction of the new Aged Care Act. The amendments to the current legislation are essential to address two immediate concerns that have been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first concern relates to the complexities of the current payment system. The second concern relates to nursing homes which are able to charge increased fees to their residents and yet fail to provide the basic standard of nursing and personal care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first concern is addressed by a series of minor amendments that relate to the simplification of the Nursing Home Payment System. Many of the criticisms of the administration of this Program relate to the complexity of the current system. Both the November 1994 Report of the Senate Community Affairs Committee Reference Committee on the "Validation of CAM and SAM Funding of Nursing Homes" and the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 19 1994-95 "Efficiency Audit&mdash;Validation of Nursing Home Funding", acknowledge the complexities of the current system and have identified problems which have arisen as a direct result of these complexities. For example, the Auditor-General has identified problems in the delivery of appropriate information to nursing home proprietors relating to the Commonwealth's requirements for the payment of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As these simplification measures can be legally achieved by changes to subordinate legislation (that is the Nursing Homes Financial Arrangements Principles&mdash;a disallowable instrument), it is proposed to proceed down this path. This would allow simplification to proceed quickly and therefore result in a clear and demonstrable response to one of the concerns of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of these simplification measures will not result in any change in the entitlement of nursing home proprietors to Commonwealth benefits. These measures will not result in any change to the level of advances paid to nursing home proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simplification measures will make it easier for a nursing home proprietor to see how the level of Commonwealth benefit was calculated. The current daily calculation of "loadings" [under or over expenditure of amounts paid for nursing and personal care] and "OCRE" [Other Cost Reimbursed Expenditure] will cease and these amounts will be included in the level of advance payment on a monthly basis. These amounts will no longer form part of the "scale of fees" determined under subsection 40AA(6), but will be included in calculation of the "notional scale of fees" determined under section 46D of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to sections 40AD, 40ADA and 51A of the Act are consequential to the above simplification measures. These amendments will preserve the right of a nursing home proprietor to seek a "merits review" of the decision as to how much Commonwealth benefit is advanced under section 51A. An aggrieved nursing home proprietor will continue to be able to seek the referral of an appeal, to the Nursing Homes Fees Review Committee of Inquiry, of a decision on the level of Commonwealth benefit paid under section 51A. The retention of a right of "merits review" is essential to ensure that unnecessary and costly appeals to the courts are circumvented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second concern is addressed by a series of minor amendments that relate to nursing homes which have been granted "exempt bed status".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent newspaper reports, relating to the compliance of nursing homes with the standards made under section 45D of the Act, have highlighted an anomaly in the current legislation. The anomaly is that the current provisions of the Act do not enable the revocation or suspension of "exempt bed status" for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing home care. The anomaly must be immediately addressed and the amendments contained in the Bill will overcome this concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The granting of "exempt bed status" under section 39AB of the Act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting "exempt bed status" is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available at a nursing home. It is clearly incongruous to continue to allow a nursing home to charge additional amounts for a supposed increased level of accommodation and services, when the level of nursing and personal care fails to meet the basic standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this Bill provide the power to suspend or revoke the "exempt bed status" of a nursing home where there is a declaration in force, under subsection 45E(1), that the nursing home does not satisfy the standards determined under section 45D of the Act. The amendments make it clear that while the "exempt bed status" of a nursing home is suspended, or revoked, a proprietor will be unable to charge the increased level of fees that would otherwise be payable by the nursing homes' patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the exercise of this new power will only occur where there are serious breaches of the section 45D standards. The decision to suspend the "exempt bed status" of a nursing home will be made where there is some prospect of the standards being reached within a short period of time and where both the nursing home proprietor and management show a commitment to taking remedial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to revoke the "exempt bed status" of a nursing home will be made where the nursing home proprietor or management fail to show a commitment to taking appropriate action within a reasonable timeframe. Where there is little prospect of the standards being reached within a reasonable period of time, then the current power, in section 44 of the Act, will be used to revoke the approval of the nursing home altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to suspend or revoke "exempt bed status" is to be subject to internal review, as well as review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 is to specify directly the Health Ministers to be consulted by the Minister before appointing the Chairperson of the Council, the Chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a Principal Committee of the Council, and the member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research. Currently the Act provides that the Minister is to consult in relation to these appointments with the other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference. The composition of that membership can of course vary from time to time and currently includes the New Zealand Minister for Health. The proposed amendment would specify that it is the Health Minister of each State and Territory who is to be consulted in relation to the appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the amendments made to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. One of the principal purposes of these amendments is to establish the basis for a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and to provide better definition to some poorly understood aspects of the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods which have been identified in it's first four years of operation. A mechanism to address shortages, or the absence, of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included in the bill. Amendments that update and consolidate the entry, search and warrant powers in a new part to the Act have also been included, together with changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the "penalty units" classifications used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation. The bill also closes a gap in the current regulatory scheme by which illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety or efficacy, are at present not able to be removed from the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration Trust Account with the Therapeutic Goods Administration Reserve, consistent with changes to be made by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1995 and related bills that will replace the Audit Act 1901. The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This is intended to ensure that technical and scientific data sought to be relied upon in connection with a general marketing application will be properly evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the success stories of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 has been the orderly transfer of listable products&mdash;vitamin and minerals, homoeopathic, herbal and sunscreen preparations above SPF4&mdash;into the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods. Since the commencement of the legislation on 15 February 1991 some 14,000 listed drug products have been placed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, and are currently being added to at the rate of some 2,000 per annum. This very strong demand for listing new products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, reflects the keen interest in the community in having access to safe and well manufactured alternative medicines and the expectation is that the present very high level of product applications will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact on the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the very high number of product applications has been substantial, with the average approval times for individual products averaging five months&mdash;well in excess of the initial target of thirty days. To address this problem, the Government provided $.775M in the 1994-95 Budget for the development of a new streamline process for listing products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods which would cut product approval time to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products. The new process makes absolutely no changes to the policy on listed products, but does provide a fully automated document lodgement and assessment process, which will be available to industry from 1 July 1995. The new electronic lodgement facility and all supporting documentation has been developed through a steering committee with membership drawn from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the three affected industry organisations, and the Consumer Health Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new accelerated listing process continues the premarket assessment of applications which is one of the central planks of the national regulatory scheme. Responsibility for making the assessment will be vested in the applicant who will be able to undertake the assessment against published criteria and documentation and submit an application in a form which is electronically compatible with the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods data base. Applications are to be accompanied by a certificate that the goods are eligible for listing, are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, their presentation is acceptable, they conform to standards and have been manufactured by an appropriately licensed manufacturer in Australia. Goods which are manufactured outside Australia will still require TGA approval of the manufacturer before a listing application can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lodgement of an electronic application under the accelerated listing process is expected to be able to reduce the timeframe for product approval from an average of five months to approximately two weeks. Subsequent to the approval, the TGA will carry out a 100% audit of product eligibility, both in terms of formulations and claims made and will subsequently undertake a random audit of applications which are lodged annually for listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. The accelerated listing process will meet the requirements of industry for certainty in terms of product launches, whilst maintaining the existing high level of surveillance of product quality and safety. In the event that the TGA surveillance demonstrates that certification by a sponsor was false, then provision is included in the bill for cancellation to be immediate on any safety related issues, but in other circumstances, for example less serious label errors, sponsors would have the opportunity to make a submission before any decision is taken to proceed to cancel the product. Any decision by the TGA to cancel the product listing is subject to appeal to the Minister and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new provision, section 19A, has been included in the Act to provide the Government with the means to deal with acute shortages of drugs supplied in Australia or that no longer are supplied here by their sponsors, or to temporarily allow into the Australian market a drug that is not available in Australia but is required to address an emergency. The Act as it stands allows individual patients to access unapproved drugs in limited circumstances. This entails prescribers to gain individual permission for each patient from Canberra, or for a prescriber to seek the status of an authorised prescriber under the Special Access Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although both of these schemes are used with advantage to permit the supply of small volumes of unregistered drugs, they are too unwieldy and too slow to make available substitute drugs, or new drugs, on a larger scale to meet an unforeseen emergency or to permit interim supply of a product registered overseas during the period of evaluation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of reasons why approval may be sought and granted for supply of drugs under this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example a company may find itself out of stock of a particular product and wish to supply the same product as registered in the United States<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>or Canada. Recently, there has been a shortage in Australia of lithium drugs used in the treatment of mental illness. It has proved very difficult to obtain a substitute product from an overseas source because of the requirement to have the product registered prior to supply in Australia. Companies who have the product have been understandably unwilling to go to the trouble and expense of registration as a stop-gap measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although vast improvements have been made in the approval time for new drugs in Australia, it remains inevitable that companies will register their drugs in America or Europe prior to introduction into Australia and that Australian patients and their doctors may have to wait until a company applies to register a drug in Australia. Provided that an application is in place in Australia and that the </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">drug is deemed to have a unique therapeutic potential by the Therapeutic Goods Administration it is proposed to permit limited supply on the basis of one or more overseas approvals. In this context, Australia has a number of arrangements in place for the interchange of information with reputable drug regulatory agencies around the world. These include the United States, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Through its membership of the PER (Pharmaceutical Evaluation Reports) Scheme, Australia is in a position to deal with most European agencies and with South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emergence of new diseases, new treatments and medical emergencies may mandate the supply of unregistered medicines as an emergency measure. Such an occasion might be the need to immunise a large number of people against a tropical disease with a vaccine held in insufficient quantities in Australia. If such a vaccine is not registered in Australia, supply is presently cumbersome requiring individual approval from Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safety measures to be put in place will include resorting to temporary approval under section 19A when no registered substitute product is available. Furthermore, delegations under this section are to be limited to the National Manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Head of the Drug Safety and Evaluation Branch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictions and conditions relating to the supply of such substitute products may be imposed to ensure that this provision cannot be used to avoid the process of drug evaluation and registration in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interface between food and drugs has been a source of considerable confusion since the commencement of the Therapeutic Goods Act in 1991. The existing definition of "therapeutic good", excludes "food" but in the absence of a definition of what constituted "food", claims have been made for example that:-</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skin treatment products that "nourish" the skin are a food and therefore not a therapeutic good,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gelatine is a food therefore products (including drugs), in gelatine capsules are not therapeutic goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These examples demonstrate the legal complexity involved in enforcement action through the courts, in the absence of a clear definition of what constitutes a food for the purposes of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Detailed discussions have been held between representatives of the National Food Authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, State and Territory health agencies, and with the food and pharmaceutical industries, aimed at clarifying the food/drug interface. The outcome of these negotiations was agreement to introduce a definition of "food" into the Therapeutic Goods Act, which made it quite clear that decisions on what constituted a food or a therapeutic good was closely linked to its presentation and promotion and that a food could not be restricted by any specific dosage limit. The words "prescribed dose" and "frequency of administration" have been included in the definition of "food" and are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and is not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing legislation has an anomaly in that it contains provision for a product to be removed from the market if it is cancelled from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, but has no similar provision for removing from the market illegal therapeutic goods that were never included in the Register, whose quality, safety and efficacy are unknown. When such products are detected, and action is taken against sponsors, there is no existing basis whereby those products can be removed from the market, pending either prosecution or submission of an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for inclusion of the product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Provision has therefore been included in the bill to enable the Secretary to require persons to take steps to recover from the market any illegal therapeutic goods, or to inform the public in a specified manner and within a reasonable timeframe, that the product has not been reviewed for quality, safety or efficacy by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Decisions of the Secretary in this matter are appealable to the Minister and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also proposes to redraft the main offence provision in the legislation, which currently provides that offences of import, export, manufacture or supply of goods in Australia are committed by a person who is the sponsor of therapeutic goods. The definition of sponsor does not however include a person who exports, imports, manufactures or arranges for the export, import or manufacture of goods on behalf of another person who is a resident of, or carrying on business in Australia. The effect of the current provision is that TGA must undertake intrusive investigations into the business affairs of persons that still fail to establish who the sponsor of the goods is, precluding any proceedings from being instituted to deter or prevent the unlawful supply of unapproved and sometimes dangerous therapeutic goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to clear away the need for such investigations into matters that can best be established by those in possession of facts best known to themselves, the sponsors, by establishing that the offence of import, export, manufacture or supply of goods in Australia for use in humans is committed by a person, and by including a statutory defence for the person to demonstrate that he was not the sponsor of the goods at the time the offence was committed. This arrangement will protect the innocent agent from prosecution, and remove from the TGA the requirement to undertake extensive investigations into the business affairs of persons who are simply acting as the agents for product sponsors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently contains provisions for entry, search, inspection, sampling and seizure in relation to premises of sponsors, manufacturers and other premises for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the Act, ensuring compliance with standards (GMP audits and post market surveillance) and gathering evidence of offences committed against the Act. These provisions are restricted to authorised persons, are provided for both with and without warrant and are spread across a number of sections and subsections contained within parts 3 (sponsors), 4 (manufacturers) and 6 (any premises) of the Act. The bill proposes to consolidate these provisions into a new Part 5A entitled "Entry, Searches and Warrants", the existing powers have been reviewed and the provisions have been re-drafted to bring them into line with the current legal policy cited in part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914, which was inserted by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now makes it quite clear that entry without warrant to the premises of sponsors and manufacturers, cannot be exercised at residential premises unless the sponsor or manufacturer uses the premises for commercial purposes in relation to therapeutic goods as well as a residence. The bill also introduces a power of entry to enable authorised persons to enter premises where it is necessary to do so in the interests of public health so as to avoid an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury. This provision is sought to enable, for example, the prevention of extremely dangerous products from entering the market (in the case say, of toxic contamination); or the halting of dangerous manufacturing process (in the case say, of a clandestine laboratory utilising volatile chemicals).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also proposes that a number of indictable offence provisions in the Act be reduced to summary offences. Since the inception of the Act, experience has shown that these matters can be more appropriately dealt with by a court of summary jurisdiction rather than through the much more lengthy trial process. This change will convenience both the Crown and the accused as well as the judicial system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently contains forfeiture upon conviction provisions in relation to illicit goods. This provision currently applies only to summary </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">offences. The bill proposes that the illicit goods, the subject of indictable conviction, also be forfeitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments detailed in this bill largely address process and safety</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the process by which drug products supplied in Australia are listed on the ARTG, as well as providing a basis for distinguishing between foods and drug products, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">safety, in providing a mechanism to remove products of unknown quality, safety and efficacy from the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also reviews, and consolidates the enforcement provisions under the Therapeutic Goods Act, and brings them into line with the most recent Commonwealth policy in this area. As such the bill will substantially assist the sponsors of listable drug products in getting good quality and well manufactured medicines onto the market in a short timeframe, whilst improving the ability of the Therapeutic Goods Administration to protect the Australian public from sub standard, unsafe or ineffective products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes included in the bill are provisions to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration Trust Account with a new Reserve Account, consistent with changes to be effected by the new financial management package, including the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1995 that will replace the Audit Act 1901. Section 45 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 will establish a Therapeutic Goods Administration Reserve and make provision for the annual appropriation of monies into the Reserve equal to the receipts identified under that section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the appeals procedure for the review of decisions to register or not register therapeutic goods under section 25 of the Act have also been included in item 148. These changes are designed to encourage applicants for general marketing of registrable therapeutic goods to provide all relevant scientific and technical data to the Secretary before a decision on registration is made under section 25 of the Act and to ensure that any new technical and scientific material not previously before the Secretary will undergo proper evaluation before a decision on review based upon merits is made by the administrative appeals tribunal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The cost of collection, processing and analysis of data, was $182.370m in 1993-94, which was 75.1 percent of ABS expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The direct cost of the Information Services component of the ABS in 1986-87 was $6.410m, which was 3.9 percent of ABS expenditure. Costs borne by other components are not available. Note that the Population Census was conducted in that financial year and ABS expenditure was much higher than usual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The publication program of the ABS varies from year to year depending on the program of collections, new releases in response to user needs, and reviews of dissemination practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the discontinuance of one or more publications does not necessarily represent a net loss of information. Increasingly, ABS clients prefer to receive information in electronic form, and many ABS publications are cyclical, published as a result of a specific collection or survey. The Population Census publications are an example of this. Where a decision is made to discontinue a publication on other than cyclical grounds e.g. on the grounds of cost/benefit, much of the data contained in the discontinued publication will be incorporated into another title. In this context, the number of ABS titles has declined slightly. The number of listed titles in 1987-88 was 520 and 443 in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, a comprehensive review of the publication program was completed which led to the cancellation of some publications, the establishment of new publications and the incorporation of some data from cancelled publications into other existing, or new, publications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Records of the titles of publications terminated since the inception of the ABS pricing policy are not available. However, records are available for the last two years and a list of the main titles discontinued and of the titles of publications which replace them is provided at Attachment 1. A full list of discontinued titles for the same period is provided at Attachment 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Statistics previously available in discontinued publications are usually available in other publications or as special data services on request. Of the 146 publications discontinued over the last two years, 26 have to date been replaced by new special data service products which can be tailored to suit individual needs. Several of these `special data service' products have been established as an interim measure pending the incorporation of statistics from the discontinued titles into new or larger publications. These new publications will be compendium publications, designed primarily to better satisfy the needs of libraries and their clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) (a), (b) Comprehensive records are not available for replacement products for discontinued publications. However, the 26 special data service products established to replace publications discontinued in 1994-5 are expected to yield about $20,000-$40,000 in a full year, and are priced on the same basis as the publications they have replaced. None are as much as double the previous price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The ABS has only ceased to provide information in publications where there was little demand and it was not cost effective to provide the information in that form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that the ABS also provides free access to its publications via an extensive complimentary service to the media and to libraries. In particular, the ABS provides a major complimentary service to libraries through its Library Extension Program (LEP). Seventy three research libraries receive all ABS publications and 487 public and TAFE libraries throughout the country receive a core set of ABS publications.</PARA>

The Department of Primary Industries and Energy undertook a section 30 analysis of all woodchip export proposals involving National Estate places. These analyses addressed the nature of the proposal, the effect of forestry operations on National Estate places, whether there were feasible and prudent alternatives, including the adverse effects on industry of not permitting forestry operations in National Estate areas and the adverse environmental impacts of providing contractual timber requirements only from non-National Estate areas. Following his consideration of these analyses the Minister for Resources decided that the export of woodchips derived from forestry operations in National Estate areas would adversely affect the National Estate, but that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives. The analyses were referred to the Australian Heritage Commission for comment and the Minister also took into account the advice received from the Australian Heritage Commission in reaching his decision to approve the export of woodchips derived from forestry operations in some National Estate places.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Since the introduction of Fringe Benefits Tax in 1986, where an employee: (a) receives a living-away-from-home allowance; (b) is reimbursed for accommodation expenses while living away from his or her usual place of residence; or (c) is provided accommodation while living away from his or her usual place of residence; it is the employer who is liable to pay tax on the benefit. No amount is included on the employee's group certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, where an employee who is not living away from his or her usual place of residence (as determined by the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986) is reimbursed for accommodation or is provided accommodation, it is again the employer who is liable to pay tax on the benefit. No amount is included on the employee's group certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An employee will only be liable to pay tax on this type of benefit where the employee is not living away from his or her usual place of residence and is paid a cash allowance. In some circumstances, the employee may claim a deduction against the taxable allowance. If an amount is to be included on the employee's group certificate, the amount to be included is the amount of the cash allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) If the LAFHA is bona fide, that is, if at the time the employee first receives the LAFHA it is intended (as evidenced by the employer and employee declarations) that the period that the employee is to live away from home is to be 12 months or less, then there will be no need to amend any previously issued employee group certificate. This is because the employee will only be liable to pay tax on the allowance from the end of the 12 months or from the time it is known that the period will extend beyond 12 months, whichever is the earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Under the proposed changes, a cash allowance paid to an employee working at a remote area construction site for a period in excess of 12 months would be taxable in the hands of the employee. However, I am aware of the concerns expressed by some about this result and I am currently considering a number of submissions on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As indicated in my answer to Question (1), there is no need to ascribe values for accommodation provided in construction camps. This is because the value does not have to be included on a group certificate.</PARA>
