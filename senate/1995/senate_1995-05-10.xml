<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Senator Herron is well aware that without this legislation it will not be possible for doctors to enter into contracts that mean no gap for patients to pay; in other words, people will have some certainty that, when they are paying for private health insurance, that is the end of it. As you well know, without this legislation it is possible now for contracts to be entered into with hospitals. It has happened in Victoria and it happens in my own state. But the gap is still there for medical expenses, and this is one of a number of things that this bill is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people do not want to insure under those tables, or doctors do not want to participate, that is fine; the existing arrangement stays. This is why some of the lobbying on behalf of the doctors has been so damaging and so misleading. Some doctors are saying on radio that only contracting doctors will be able to work in the private sector, which I find very difficult to come to terms with, considering doctors are a well educated group in the community. Also, some of the lobbying information that has been circulated amongst some of the professions is disgraceful. Doctors have not taken the opportunity to become informed and to talk to people about this legislation but have gone off at tangents trying to convince their profession not to sign contracts, for very spurious reasons. I think some of this has been most unfortunate. If anything, the misinformation is damaging the doctors' patients because it is unnecessarily concerning them. They will have the option to stay where they are now if they wish, but this legislation is giving them an additional choice. </PARA>

I am bringing up the fact because it is one of the areas that is really worrying people in country areas.

<PARA>This amendment relates to the privacy provisions and the uncertainty about why data is needed under the existing proposals. It came out in evidence that the government, the hospitals and the insurers are divided on what data is needed and why and who should collect it. I questioned this matter previously in relation to another amendment. Section 23EA(1) was amended to authorise private hospitals to provide relevant casemix data to a private hospital independent data bureau established for the purpose of collecting, collating, analysing and reporting on all private patient data from 1 July 1995. This section would commence on 1 July 1995, not 1 April 1996, because we recognise the importance of data collection and analysis as a proper precursor to this package being implemented effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Private Hospitals Association has expressed a preference for an independent data agency. The coalition recognises the importance of data collection and the importance of privacy in relation to this data. Under the aegis of the Privacy Commissioner there are restrictions as to the availability of this data. However, we believe that there should be a statutory agency established to achieve this, even though it would still be within the scope of the Commonwealth administrative and privacy laws. We think that is of great importance in putting the collection of data at arms-length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might refer back to the pharmaceutical benefits provisions in relation to the provision of data to a public servant. This concerned a case of genital herpes in a small town where permission was being sought for the use of a restricted drug. In that case the general practitioner had to ring a public servant to gain permission for this prescription to be allowed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This illustrates the point I am making in relation to that being at arms length. Of course somebody has to know about it, but if that data can be collated and is protected by a specific agency, and the same sort of information is given to government, then the objective will be achieved while protection is provided by putting a statutory authority between the private hospitals and the government. That is an added check. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we are proposing the agency be in place by 1 January next year; although, in practice, this could be sooner, depending on how long it took to establish.

It seems to us that this, for whatever reason, has not properly taken place up until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision goes to the heart of one of our pre-conditions to entertain the bill&mdash;that is, adequate protection of privacy. There are no clear indications of why the department and PHIAC should have a central role in data collection and dissemination and how they would use this data they collect. The minister will recall that I questioned this at some length in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearings and I did not get an adequate answer to those questions. Because of that, we are submitting this amendment. We still are not convinced that we can support the government-Democrat data arrangements as they exist at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We offer this amendment as a compromise that has the best chance of gaining a consensus among the affected parties. This amendment ensures that insurers are not prevented from getting access to patient data from private hospitals for payment purposes. That still continues under this amendment. We appreciate that the chamber has accepted an earlier government amendment to section 73AB. But we cannot state too strongly that we continue to object to the arrangements outlined in that section.

You may have control over the government because you have access to it and because you have the balance of power. But from the opposition's point of view, that is certainly new information. That is a classic example of the point that I am referring to. You have got no control over the government. It will be nice to you about this legislation. As I expected, you do have genuine concern about it. But to say that, by leaving it with the government, you have some sort of control over it&mdash;Senator Lees, I know you are not ingenuous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess it is best to avoid responding to all the abuse that comes around in this place. The Temporary Chairman will put this amendment to the vote, and as this has been very extensively canvassed&mdash;it has all been discussed at length before&mdash;one way to expedite matters would be to allow that to go through. Senator Harradine seems to want further information, and we are very happy to provide this. I must say that I do think this legislation would be helped if there was less abuse. Senator Herron, just because it is pronounced correctly does not make it less abusive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers this portion of the amendment unnecessary. I find it interesting to listen to Senator Herron argue that Big Brother has got us all now, and then propose an amendment to create another brother, perhaps a little sister. Also, his argument about genital herpes would mean that there would just be more people knowing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways the best argument is that there is no justification for the creation of an additional statutory authority to handle data. The department and the private health insurance advisory council will not have access to patient-identified data and the department is already subject to stringent secrecy provisions under the Health Insurance Act, the National Health Act, the Privacy Act and the Crimes Act. Secrecy provisions as applicable to a data bureau as proposed in this amendment would not be subject to the same stringent secrecy provisions. An authority outside the Commonwealth bureaucracy would not be subject to these provisions and thus the patient confidentiality could be less protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claims have been made that the private health insurance advisory council's proposed task of collecting and disseminating information about products for their comparison is impossible. This suggests that consumers would find the task equally impossible and should hence rely on intuition, prejudice or inertia. In such an environment persons not holding insurance would find it impossible to make an informed choice and presumably would continue not to hold insurance. This is not the way to encourage insurance amongst the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been handed a copy of a letter which I presume is, if not the same, very similar to the one that Senator Lees referred to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point the minister seems to be unaware of is that the private hospitals have all that information anyway. They are dealing with the patients who are in those hospitals; they have all that data. To allege that another agency will make more information available seems to convey a complete misunderstanding of this amendment. The private hospitals have all that data. They have the hospital notes, if you like. They already have more data than is available to the government. We are asking that it be collated by the private hospitals and that it then go to an independent authority, given that all those privacy restrictions cover the data anyway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that much of this discussion that has taken place about this piece of legislation has not been full, free and open to all. The Senate committee undertook its task for the benefit of all of us. The committee reported on the various aspects that were canvassed before it. That report, as well as the material that came forward from various organisations and individuals throughout Australia, provided me with a very good basis upon which to examine my attitude to the legislation. We have here an important matter relating to privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major functions of this chamber is to ensure that the rights of individuals are upheld. For the rights of the individual to be upheld this question of privacy is essential; it is most relevant. Examples have been given by Senator Herron and other examples have come to my mind. From my discussions in estimates and on other committees, I have become of aware how the department operates. In many instances there is, unfortunately, complete obfuscation. Talk about ministerial responsibility! Have we seen it here? The minister does not know the provisions, let alone the answers to the questions that might be asked in many instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this is not the minister's portfolio but where the minister does deal with relevant information on a matter in a particular bill and that information is really essential for others who have to make up their minds on which way they need to vote, that information ought to be made available to all. The government talks about numbers in this place. It may have escaped people's notice but the fact is that if the opposition moves an amendment such as this, and it is supported by the Greens and me, that amendment is carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am inclined at this point, because I have not been given all the information by the government and because the explanation that has been given by the minister thus far is not satisfactory, to vote for the amendment that has been put by Senator Herron. I hope it is carried. This will have the effect of sending that amendment, along with the heaps of other amendments that are being agreed to, back to the House of Representatives. Then, if the House of Representatives and the minister in that place have a basic objection to this amendment, they can detail their objections and we might be able to reconsider the matter in the light of their considered objections.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, this legislation says that if people are not informed in writing of their liability for what the doctors are going to charge&mdash;that is, the difference between the scheduled fee and the actual costs&mdash;then they simply do not have to pay. To some extent we are being overtaken by the courts which have made a number of decisions along these lines in recent months. People who have taken their complaint to a number of different courts around this country have found that they have not had to pay because there was no real contract between them and the doctor for that additional amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would not have taken effect until 1 July 1998 which would have given plenty of time for greater compliance by members of the medical profession to actually let their patients have full financial information at the time of entering into an agreement with them for service. This amendment would again, I believe, help the private health industry because it would undo one of the major problems&mdash;that people have bills delivered to their home after they have left hospital which they had absolutely no warning would be coming and are then faced not only with their private health insurance but with additional gap payments of which they were not aware. </PARA>

As the underlying purpose of the compliance is to ensure that all parties contribute appropriately to community rating, any exception only imposes added burdens to the rest of the appropriately insured community.

There is a government-Democrat amendment which allows for the continuation of such schemes which were part of an enterprise agreement as at 1 July 1995 to remain in place until 1 July 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is reasonable to say that there is not a good case at all for further exceptions or delays. They would not be acceptable. If all agreements have lapsed by 1 July 1996, deferring the time before they are legally extinct for another year will only give a false optimism to some of the employers or employees or maybe will just create confusion. I think that you have almost effectively argued the case yourself, Senator Herron. It is not new to the employers; they have understood over the last three years that these changes were coming. They are covered until 1 July 1996 and I am advised that that should protect most agreements. Giving them another year will only put it out for another year and create the possibility for further confusion and even false hopes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the employer groups appeared before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee they gave evidence that they had not been consulted and that they were totally unaware of the effects of the legislation on them. By not accepting the amendments, the government is effectively penalising the employees, not the employers, because in many instances, financially, it will be better for them to get out of the schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>

In moving these amendments on behalf of employees we recognise that there was no consultation&mdash;and that was clearly the evidence of the employer organisations before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The then minister had said&mdash;as you have said, Minister&mdash;that it had been going on for three years, but we have had three ministers in three years. Who do we trust in this game?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had that debate and I do not want to waste the time of the Senate in going into the question of the failure of consultation. A screed was put out by the minister in which it was said that consultations occurred. But it appeared that all the consultations occurred between the ACTU-Caucus working party and the immediate minister, former Senator Richardson. The employer organisations left us in no doubt whatsoever that there had been no consultations in this regard. So, we forcefully move our amendments in the interests of employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Herron has mentioned, the matter was canvassed before the Senate committee and it is mentioned in the committee's report that employer groups warned that the legislation would force them to be in breech of either this legislation or the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and expose them to substantial penalties. To a certain extent that has been dealt with by the minister when she said that they will expire&mdash;except for one, I think. I am not sure which one that is.</PARA></TALK.START>

The provision of health care and health insurance to employees is contained in enterprise agreements, which have been encouraged by the current government. Obviously, if they go by the board there will need to be extensive renegotiation. I would not mind the job of representing the workers in those renegotiations, even though I would be starting from behind the eight ball. </PARA>

That is a very important point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first arrived in this place, I sat on a Senate committee looking at private hospitals and nursing homes. While it is quite clear that most private hospitals in this country are of very admirable and excellent quality, there was certainly evidence given to us about a few private hospitals where the quality of care was shameful and from where, on examination, all patients were removed and taken to a large public hospital, to be restored to good health and for continuing care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear, in case anybody wants to misrepresent me yet again, that that is a very small number of private hospitals but most of us would have known of a few over the last 10 or 20 years that were a cause of grave concern. That is why the accreditation guidelines have been established; it is a recognition of the need to set guidelines for a good or acceptable standard and then, of course, regularly review it to see that hospitals maintain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lees says, this process is not being rushed in. It is to be decided after discussion and with the cooperation of the players concerned. It is allowing a government or the NHMRC&mdash;not just anybody&mdash;to make an application to the minister. It is a thoughtful and considered way to say that if there are hospitals that are clearly below standard&mdash;not up to accreditation guidelines&mdash;then an application would be made to cease the minimal payment to those hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the hospital wants to object to that it has a process to do so. As well, if the hospital changes its standards, or if its accreditation guidelines are achieved, then there is opportunity for the payment to be restarted.

That industry brought it in; it had nothing to do with government. I understand Minister Crowley's explanation in relation to it.

I cannot think of any hospitals in my own state where this would be applicable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees referred to some particular instances where a particular service may not meet those standards. This is the fear of a certain segment of the health-care industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this may not affect a large number of hospitals, nor may it affect a large number of services in a particular hospital, it is very important. As the minister knows, and as everybody in this chamber knows, malpractice insurance is skyrocketing for doctors in this country. The number of actions that are being entered into by complainants is also increasing dramatically. While it may not be a large number, and while it may not be a large section of private hospitals that is influenced, you can understand questions relating to the guidelines that are to be used. There is a fear that this legislation may mean that some government instrumentality will determine that no default payment will be paid in that particular hospital for that particular service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is Senator Herron suggesting that a private company would say to a hospital, `If you don't sign up with us, we'll default you'? I do not understand how you could possibly imagine that this would be used as a lever. Anyhow, it is not how it would even happen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on two reports which are very important&mdash;one of which has been before the Senate and one of which supports the concerns raised in that Senate report. It is a report by a number of concerned people in my home state of Queensland. The report which has already been presented to the Senate is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drugs, money and governments&mdash;A report by the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A supporting statement of concern has been prepared by the Biala and Wacol support group&mdash;a group of people who have been not only concerned but more and more deeply concerned about the cuts in funding by the Queensland government for alcohol and drug rehabilitation in Queensland. The concern is underlined by the fact that cuts have not been equal, in any sense, to a decline in alcohol and drug abuse; rather, the abuse of these drugs continues to increase. I want to remind the chamber of some of the recommendations which were made in the report by the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia. I turn first of all to recommendations 1, 2 and 3, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding available for prevention, research, education, intervention and treatment of drug related problems should be increased and sustained.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments need to ensure that adequate treatment programs and services are available to all people experiencing drug related problems.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments must begin to involve non-government organisations, local communities and consumer groups in the process of decision making, especially in areas such as service delivery, research, policy development and planning.</PARA>
<PARA>These recommendations&mdash;and they are very good ones&mdash;ought to be set against a background of the reality of the cost of drug abuse in the Australian community. Again I read from the council's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 there were an estimated 26,335 deaths in Australia due to drug use. Of these drug-caused deaths, tobacco amounted for 71.6%, alcohol for 25.9%, and other drugs 2.5%. Legal drugs have the greatest impact on the health of Australians, and this impact is becoming more noticeable in specific populations, such as youth, women, people of Aboriginal descent, offenders and those experiencing mental illness (dual disability).</PARA>
<PARA>The report also goes on to list the performance of the various states. I want to commend, in this regard, the performance of the Northern Territory. It has obviously addressed this problem in a very serious way. The report, in relation to the territory, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Living with Alcohol Program, an alcohol levy has been introduced in the Northern Territory, which has generated an additional $4,906,000 of revenue, all of which is spent directly on drug programs and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One State stands out in funding of drug programs per head&mdash;the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has the smallest population, and spends the most funds per head on drug programs and services ($55.90).</PARA>
<PARA>I am disappointed in the performance of my own state, Queensland. I would like to put on the record just some of the results from the tables which are included in this report. Table one lists the expenditure on drug programs and services through state health departments. The funding per head in Queensland is the lowest of all the states and territories at $4.40 per head. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most States there is no clear and direct accountability of funds. In some States, where funding is provided to regions, there appears to be no requirement for these regions to either inform where funds are actually spent or to account for funds earmarked for specific purposes. Because of this, there is no guarantee that funds allocated to drug programs and services are actually being expended in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>I return to the issue of revenue from alcohol and tobacco taxes. Again, my own state performs very poorly in this area. Out of the revenue returned to drug programs, the Northern Territory is again at the top, returning 24.3 per cent of the revenue to the programs. Unfortunately, my own state returned only 2.9 per cent. I am putting this on the record not simply as a criticism but in an attempt to urge my state to address this very serious problem in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey results overall show that in many of the categories my state is last. For example, in identifying the extent of drug problems, Queensland is seventh; in the priority of addressing drug problems, it is seventh again; in ensuring that information is available to the community, it is seventh; and, in ensuring treatment programs and services are available, it is eighth. Just to show that we do perform better in some cases, in a clear strategy to address drug problems, we come second. I might add that it is not much use having a strategy if we do not fund that strategy adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the statement of concern issued by the Biala and Wacol support group. Amongst many other concerned citizens and organisations in Queensland, I am one of the signatories to this statement. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We undersigned representatives of trade unions, community organisations and church justice groups, hereby call on the Premier Mr Goss, the Health Minister Mr Elder and State Government in the interest of community and worker health . . . </PARA>
<PARA>to do a number of things. In other words, this is not simply a report which is critical; rather, it is a report that puts forward positive suggestions about what ought to be done. These recommendations include increasing expenditure on alcohol and drug dependency services, reversing the cutback to the Biala centre in Brisbane, giving a firm undertaking that the remaining six triage beds at Biala will be maintained, and reopening the 60-bed Wacol rehabilitation centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to support the report of this group. Many of the people in the group have been through drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs themselves. They know exactly the benefit of those programs to themselves, and that is why they are concerned to ensure that such programs are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me close this submission to the Senate by reading the conclusion of the report from the support group. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gutting of Biala, the closure of Wacol Rehabilitation Unit, the inadequate funding of alcohol and drug dependency services, the denial of treatment to many prospective patients while the health ministry promotes the deceptive concept of underfunded community-based referral programmes, highlights what many consider to be an emerging crisis in alcohol and drug dependency services in regions in which we are familiar namely Brisbane north and south and the west Moreton region.</PARA>
<PARA>From speaking today to one of the authors of the original report by the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia, I do understand that there is a lot of pressure being applied to the Queensland government, and there are some signs that there will be a response to this issue in the coming budget of the Queensland government. That is why, in placing on the record today the concerns that many people have, I do hope that that pressure and those concerns will result in an improvement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Including you, Senator Woodley. Congratulations! I think it is an important convention, and it is an important communique. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that over the last 12 to 18 months there has been a fairly vigorous debate in this chamber and elsewhere about the role that parliaments should have in the consideration of international treaties. This debate has resulted from growing community concern about the way this government goes about its treaty making activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of eminent Australians have strongly endorsed the view that parliament should have a greater role in the scrutiny of treaties. I bring to the attention of the Senate two papers&mdash;one by Sir Ninian Stephen, a former Justice of the High Court and former Governor-General of Australia; and one by the Hon. Justice Michael Kirby, who is the President of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales. Both those eminent people recently made important speeches which called for the greater involvement by parliament in the treaty making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time available to me, I would like to quote an extract from Justice Kirby's paper, which was delivered in February, entitled `Human Rights&mdash;The International Dimension'. Justice Kirby said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some important treaties have been ratified with little Parliamentary or public debate. The growing body of treaty law has an increasing impact on Australian law. It therefore seems legitimate, in some way, now to involve the national Parliament in the superintendence of Executive action in respect of treaties. The old rule may have been apt for a time when international law was in its infancy. But nowadays, in economic matters as well as those relevant to human rights, the growth of international treaty law is extremely significant and growing even more important. Whilst I understand the politics of resistance to Parliamentary scrutiny and would regret a move to the United States requirement of advice and consent of the legislature, which has proved such a reinforcement of isolationism, there is surely an intermediate position. Parliamentary scrutiny is not the same as Parliamentary approval. Scrutiny could be part of the larger function of raising Australian awareness of the growing body and importance of international law.</PARA>
<PARA>Similar comments were made by Sir Ninian Stephen who pointed to the democratic deficit which was growing as a result of the large number of international treaties and instruments to which governments are adhering. I understand in recent days even Sir Anthony Mason joined the debate when he called again for greater public debate on the way treaties are affecting Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three particular examples which have generated widespread public debate come readily to mind. The first one is the ratification of the first optional protocol which involved the UN human rights committee in our Australian legal system. I bring to the attention of the Senate comments on this matter by Anne Twomey who wrote a paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Procedure and practice of entering and implementing international treaties</EMPHASIS>. That paper was issued in February this year. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the treaties tabled after having already come into effect are of great importance to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the parliament was told after all the processes had gone through. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR was tabled on 26 November 1991 after the Government had deposited its instrument of accession on 25 September 1991. There was no other Parliamentary debate or legislative scrutiny before the First Optional Protocol was acceded to by Australia. Given the great impact that this treaty has already had on Australia, being the catalyst for the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994</EMPHASIS>, it is extraordinary that the Government acceded to it without any public debate or even public awareness of its existence, let alone its scope and significance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the cases which has given rise to widespread public concern. The second one, hours before the last election, was the ratification of ILO convention No. 158 on the termination of employment. That particular convention was ratified over the objections of virtually all the states&mdash;even Queensland&mdash;and over the heads of many of the business groups which were consulted, with the sole exception of the ACTU which strongly supported it. Nonetheless, it was ratified hours before the writs for the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government omitted to inform not only the parliament that such a thing had happened&mdash;parliament was presumably not sitting at that time&mdash;but also omitted to inform the community. That particular action by the government, Senator Evans and Mr Brereton has given further widespread concern about the treaty-making activities as practised by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue which has come to recent public attention is the Teoh case. Honourable senators will be aware that the High Court decided that when the executive ratifies an international treaty, provided there are no statutory or executive indications to the contrary, a legitimate expectation is created that administrative decision makers will act in accordance with the treaty. Should the decision makers not act in such a manner, procedural fairness requires that the person affected be given the opportunity to persuade them otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into the details of the Teoh case, the implications of that are seen by many people to be a matter of widespread concern. In view of the fact that there are so many treaties that Australia is now party to&mdash;some 900&mdash;the implications that this may have on the way law is administered in this country is a matter of public debate and concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communique which was issued by the conference is important because it recognised that parliament should have a role in treaty-making activities. The conference communique stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conference expressed support for greater transparency and wider consultation in treaty making processes, particularly through the involvement of parliament. Concern was expressed at the difficulty of determining what obligations Australia had undertaken through international treaty-making. There was support for the proposition that the existing register of treaties should be amended to clarify these obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clear support was also expressed for greater involvement by the States in treaty-making processes. The conference supported the proposition that a Treaties Council should be created, associated with the Council of Australian Governments, and that prior to ratification after signing, the Federal government be required to bring treaties before the Council for agreement. However, in the event that agreement cannot be reached, the Federal government should not be prevented from proceeding to ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should be a requirement that treaties be tabled in both houses of the Federal parliament prior to ratification and after signing, together with a statement of the implications for Australia of accession. The conference expressed strong support for the establishment of a joint standing parliamentary committee on treaties, with a power to conduct hearings and take evidence from the general public.</PARA>
<PARA>I point out to senators: now we not only have some of the very eminent law makers in this land calling for greater involvement by parliament in the treaty making activities, we also have a conference which has issued a communique which gives strong support to that position, that parliament should have a role to scrutinise treaty making activities more effectively. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there is one person and one person alone who is opposed to this tidal wave of support from the community for this position, that parliament should have a role, and that is our very own foreign minister, Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote what Senator Evans said to the conference. This is what Senator Evans, who portrays himself as a man greatly concerned with human rights and the democratic process, said. Senator Evans said that treaties should not be subjected to the vagaries of parliament. But I am delighted to inform the Senate that that particular position has no support. It has no support amongst some of the most eminent jurors in this land. It has no support amongst the delegates who attended the Constitutional Centenary Foundation convention in Canberra last weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, as far as the coalition is concerned, the coalition has overwhelmingly and by consensus embraced the need for greater parliamentary scrutiny and consultation with regard to the treaty making process. We have put forward a variety of specific proposals which will bring that into effect including, of course, our proposal to establish a treaties council as part of the COAG process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude my comments: it has been an important debate. It is a debate which has been in this parliament and in the wider community. In my view, Senator Evans has comprehensively lost that debate and it is now time that the government recognised community sentiment, that parliament must have a role to scrutinise and to give a view on the treaty making activities of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, during this public interest discussion, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the 50th anniversary of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition to Macquarie Island will be celebrated in 1998. I make a request to the government and the scientific community that this 50th anniversary be appropriately recognised and celebrated. Apart from the Macquarie Island expedition, there were two other ANARE expeditions and operations in 1947. They were to Heard Island and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wyatt Earp</EMPHASIS> exploratory expedition to the Antarctic continent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Macquarie Island is 33 kilometres long, five kilometres wide and lies some 1,300 kilometres south east of my home state of Tasmania. It is the last green outpost before the landscape turns to ice, although because of the climate it is treeless. It may be of interest to honourable senators to know some of the history of Macquarie Island and the reason for my request through this chamber to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first expedition to Macquarie Island left Australia on 28 February 1948. The party consisted of 13 members who travelled via Hobart for a 12-month stay in order to establish a permanent base as well as undertake scientific research. Members of the group were Alan Martin, leader, meteorologist; William Monkhouse, meteorologist; Ron Chadder, meteorologist; Geoff Mottershead, radio; Gersh Major, radio; Peter King, radio; Charles du Toit, chef; Dr Roger Bennet, medico; Ron Kenny, biologist; and Charles Scoble, who was the engineer. Unfortunately Charles died on 4 July 1948, and I will refer to that tragic incident later. Then there were Charles Leigh Speedy, known affectionately later to his many science students as Leigh Speedy, Ken Hines and Norm Laird. Leigh Speedy was not only a great academic but also a fine sportsman. He was later to become a college principal and minister of the Uniting Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Travelling on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labuan</EMPHASIS>, the party reached the island on 7 March and a camp was set up at Garden Cove. Heavy gear and equipment&mdash;such as a bulldozer, generators and huts&mdash;were landed by pontoon rafts. It took until 21 March to complete the unloading, with the loss of several rafts and one boat due to unpredictable currents, thick kelp, hidden rocks and strong winds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conditions onshore were extremely difficult with driving rain, bitter cold and deep mud to contend with. However, the first huts were completed and the party then set about establishing themselves for their 12-month stay. The work of this party was identical to that carried out on Heard Island: daily transmission of meteorological data to Australia by radio, cosmic ray studies and topographical, geographical and biological surveys of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the members, Charles Scoble, the diesel engineer, was unfortunately drowned while skiing over a frozen plateau lake. He was buried beside the lake which is now known as Lake Scoble. Charles Scoble left a young wife, Margery, and two lovely little girls&mdash;Rosemary aged four and Heather aged two&mdash;who were too young to remember their father or understand the tragedy. A number of years later the Scoble family&mdash;his widow and two daughters&mdash;prepared a plaque for his grave and it was taken down to Macquarie Island by Doug Speedy, a nephew of the first expeditioner Charles Speedy, on his second tour of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The photographer on this journey was Mr Norman Laird, the Tasmanian representative. He was one of the senior members of the Tasmanian Film Unit at the time. His colleagues described him as a brilliant still and cine photographer. He was awarded a fellowship from one of the major British societies for his photography of black-browed albatrosses on Macquarie Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a keen interest both strategically and territorially in this island, particularly the state of Tasmania. Since the establishment of this permanent base in 1948, Australia has undertaken scientific research on a continuous basis. About 20 expeditioners&mdash;scientists, weather observers and support staff&mdash;winter on Macquarie Island each year. A further group of people stay either for a summer or for a few days while the supply ship unloads cargo and exchanges personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surrounded by some of the richest waters on earth, the island boasts one of the largest concentrations of fauna in the world. In fact, in 1971 the island was declared a nature reserve. Macquarie Island is now administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in Tasmania and, in the last few years, it has had a full-time wildlife officer permanently stationed on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the significance of this region to Australia, I would hope that appropriate recognition of this important event is given. One suggestion has been that a return visit be arranged for a small party of the original expedition members. Should this eventuate, it would indeed be an opportune time to consider making a documentary film on this area. I am sure such a film would be of great interest to many people to see the significant changes on Macquarie Island since 1948 and how well it has recovered since the sealing days of the early 1900s. Fortunately, the sealing industry was forced to abandon the island in 1919 and, in 1933, it was declared a sanctuary. From the decimated stock, wildlife populations have, over the years, returned to former levels and the island once again swarms with life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A documentary would show the magnificence of Macquarie Island and its wildlife to a very wide audience who would not otherwise have the opportunity of seeing this area of the world. It would also pay a fitting tribute to those who established our presence permanently on Macquarie Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take the opportunity of stating that I was really very privileged to be taught by one of those very senior scientists from that island, Mr Charles Leigh Speedy. Mr Speedy was a scientist of great distinction and, after his time on Macquarie Island, he returned to Australia and gained a masters degree for his cosmic ray research and subsequently took up a teaching position at Scotch College in Launceston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be fitting to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition to Macquarie Island in 1948 in some very special way. I ask the minister whether, as part of the commemoration, consideration could be given to arranging a return visit for a small representative group of those involved on that first expedition to Macquarie Island in 1948. As I said, it was during that expedition that the permanent base was established on the island. With such a large lead time required for planning, and in recognising the annual changeover, I believe that my suggestion of a 50-year celebration return party could be incorporated into the normal changeover trip to Macquarie Island. This would enable those travelling to spend a short time on the island while the supply ship unloaded cargo and personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier in my address, one of the members of the original expedition, Charles Scoble, died whilst skiing over a frozen plateau lake. As I said, this lake is now known as Lake Scoble. I put it to the minister that, since Charles Scoble was buried beside the lake, it would be a particularly fine gesture to include his wife as a possible member of such a return party, to enable her to see her husband's grave and to place a memorial plaque on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that Australia has a keen interest, both territorially and strategically, because of the large amount of scientific research that has been carried out continuously since 1948, the 50th anniversary could be a significant event. I ask that members or representatives from the original party be given the opportunity of returning to the island in 1998, and that a documentary film be prepared as part of that particular celebration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to pay tribute to the important roles in Australian society that members of that pioneering party have subsequently taken. They have continued to take a most significant role in Australian life, educating young Australians, particularly in the sciences, as well as significantly contributing to the moulding of their character. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the matters of public interest discussion to talk about last night's budget and in particular its implications for older Australians. As people in this chamber know, it has been a passion of mine, long before coming to this chamber, to champion the causes and issues relating to older Australians. Australia has 4.5 million people over 50 years of age. This represents 25.3 per cent of the population&mdash;a quarter of the population. There are now over 2 million people over 65 years of age in Australia. This represents almost 12 per cent of the population. It will increase by 20,000 in the year 2031.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older Australians are an increasingly large group in the population. Many sections of that older group are quite vocal and quite powerful but obviously not powerful enough, given the budget last night. The budget handed down by Mr Keating last night virtually ignores older Australians. There are some welcome measures, to give credit where credit is due, but they do not go anywhere near far enough in addressing the crucial issues facing what is a rapidly aging Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June of last year, Professor Bob Gregory reported to the government on nursing home funding arrangements and on the recurrent funding. In so doing, he discovered that there were significant problems related to capital funding in nursing homes and hostels. His report revealed that Australia's nursing home industry is facing a crisis, and that is the only word that can be used for this. He estimated that the upgrading of existing stock&mdash;that is, upgrading what we have&mdash;would cost $520 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now one would think this would be an urgent priority, especially as it concerns one of the most vulnerable groups in our community, the frail aged. But what do we have from this government? A budget allocation for overcoming the problem of poor quality nursing home buildings, which amounts to only $33.4 million over four years. People do not have to be brilliant mathematicians to divide four into 33 to find out what the government is spending on nursing homes per annum. In view of the state of some of the nursing homes, that will not even touch the sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing is leaving a problem that is getting progressively worse; it is not going to get any better. Each year it will get significantly worse and the stock will deteriorate, yet the government is doing nothing about it. I was cynical enough to think, before the last election, that it did nothing because it thought it was going to lose and then we would wear the odium of the declining stock in nursing homes. But the government has not done much about it even now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory, in a report the government commissioned, has alerted it to a serious problem facing Australia, that there is a decline in nursing home stock. In the end, the next generation will have to pay for that because there is the baby boom coming through and there will be an increased demand for nursing home stock. Some of those nursing homes are 30 years old now and those nursing homes, even with the best will in the world on the part of the directors of nursing, and with the best will in the world on the part of the staff, are operating under circumstances which are not satisfactory. That is the sort of thing that Professor Gregory found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I found very disturbing was that people with dementia were virtually totally ignored in this budget. I do not know what people have to do to convince this government that there is a major crisis out there in the community concerning people who require residential care. As I said, to give credit where credit is due, the government has increased funding to carers. They are the people who stay at home and care 26 hours a day or 30 hours a day because that is the sort of day it is. It is night-time, too, and sometimes the carer is up two, three and four times a night with somebody who is wandering or incontinent. Those carers put in 24 hours. They cannot go to the shop because the person for whom they are caring may light the stove or may use matches. Matches have to be hidden; electrical appliances have to be put away. They live constantly with the anxiety of the person, their loved one, who is no longer capable of behaving in a rational, predictable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately the government has seen fit to have an increase in funding there which, while not sufficient, at least is a response to the obvious needs of carers. But the government has not responded at all to those people who can no longer care for someone with dementia, either because it has become too difficult or because they are ill themselves. I do not know why minister after minister in the health portfolio, such as Minister Howe, Minister Richardson&mdash;I do not think he addressed it&mdash;and now Minister Lawrence bury their heads in the sand and do not accept the fact that we need dementia specific facilities for people with behavioural disturbances with dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people with dementia who do not have severe behavioural problems, who can be integrated with older people in nursing homes. But it denies the rights of residents who do not have dementia. When there is a person with dementia who goes into someone else's room, who rifles through their drawers, who may do other things in the room&mdash;and I will not go into the details here&mdash;who is noisy, who is disruptive, who interferes with the rights of residents in the nursing home, then we have to consider the rights of the residents as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever is the block in the department or the government, wherever it is&mdash;and the government should have the will and the wit to do something about it&mdash;nursing home after nursing home after hostel that I visit all argue that they need an area where they can segregate people with severe dementia with behavioural overlay, so that they can look after them, give them appropriate care and reduce the stress on other residents. But the government will not have a bar of it, and again the budget shows that they have not heard the plea of those in the industry who give their all to caring for people with dementia, that there is a special need for people with dementia who have behavioural disturbances and behavioural overlay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I found interesting in the budget was that the government has put some money aside for health promotion and illness prevention measures. But who gets left out of that? Older people. We put them on the scrap heap as far as health is concerned. There is a plethora of studies that show that older people who exercise can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis, and that they can gain muscle strength. It is not all downhill, with exercise and with care in the prescription of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other areas where we see a decline in health is in the effects of polypharmacy, where care is not taken over multiple prescription drugs being taken by older people, and the effect that that can have on their health. We can help health promotion in that area by encouraging older people and doctors to monitor the prescription drugs that these older people are taking, plus the over-the-counter drugs that they are taking&mdash;antacids or whatever else. Older people need to be educated about the interaction of those with prescribed drugs; but older people have been forgotten in the health promotion package of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people have also been forgotten in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Those older people who do not have a health care card, especially those who are on the cusp of being eligible for one, now find that they will have to reach a threshold of $600 before they get their pharmaceuticals at the rate of $2.60. I am sure a lot of older Australians who have made every effort to provide for themselves will find that a blow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that they will find a blow is that they will now be required to pay an increased Medicare tax. None of this levy business: it is a tax. That is what it is, a tax. Their Medicare levy/tax has gone up, but I bet they do not see their waiting lists shortened for it. Many of them will struggle to pay their medical benefits, and they will also be paying their increased Medicare levy/tax. There is so much to go on about that I have lost my place for a moment. There is issue after issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that has come to light in this budget is that there will be a new pension income assessment. This is not before time. For ages, the coalition has been arguing for the repeal of the legislation which treated capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of assessing tax. I expressed my concern about this when the legislation went through the house, and we said that in government we would review it. Unfortunately for Australia and for older people we did not get into government at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To keep that promise as much as I could, I put a private member's bill in this place to have it repealed, and I argued that there should be an inquiry. We set up an inquiry into incomes and assets tests in this place through a notice of motion. The government would not agree to it. Nor would the Democrats, because the Democrats said that the government was going to have its own inquiry. So, in conjunction with the Democrats, we put a motion forward that if the government did not put down terms of reference for its inquiry into the capital gains on income being assessed for purposes of the pension, our inquiry would take place. That was a sword that we hung over the government, and it did put the inquiry into place. But, as Aged Care Australia says, it has not really responded in great detail to that inquiry. The government should not have needed to have an inquiry. That should have been done beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen many pensioners concerned about the small amount of money that they have saved for emergencies: not, as people have said on the other side, many who have got heaps of money who are trying to get the pension and fiddle the books, but many who have saved over years to buy shares. They have saved to buy shares in order to have a small income and to be able to meet the difficult things that happen in life: things like the refrigerator breaking down, the gas heater blowing up, or the roof needing retiling. They have bought shares to have that bit of money for emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have sold those shares now because the fluctuations in their income were so great that they could not tolerate them. Honourable members sitting here in the chamber know that when the share prices were going up we had pensioner after pensioner coming into our offices concerned about the fluctuations in their income. Since there has been a decline in the market there has not been as many people coming in, but it was just an outrageous thing that the government did and it has taken this long to do something about it. That is another way in which older people have been treated in a very shabby way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mature age allowance had a sunset clause on it and was to end in 1996. After this the government says in the budget there will be a modified mature age allowance. Do honourable members know why we need a mature age allowance? The answer is because there are so many older people who have been put on the scrap heap of unemployment and who have now joined the ranks of the long-term unemployed. That is why we need the mature age allowance. Many of those people do not want to be on a mature age allowance. They want to be working. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had to create a mature age allowance because of its economic mismanagement. This is another signal to older Australians of what the government has done to their country, the country that they worked their insides out to build up only to be squandered by the government. Many of these people are victims. They have to go onto the mature age allowance because they cannot get a job. There is an army of people with skills and abilities who are on the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about older Australians who thought they were going to get tax cuts? Mr Keating promised them tax cuts. There is nothing in it for older self-funded retirees. They do not benefit from any compensation in superannuation payments. Senator Sherry, tell me what you are going to say to self-funded retirees who were given a promise by Mr Keating at the last election, `You will get tax cuts.' That promise has been broken. In this budget the government has let older Australians down abominably and it will stand condemned for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Patterson has pointed out, there has been a fair amount of concentration on Mr Keating's broken promises, the breach of faith, the breach of trust and the breach of the basic undertakings given by Mr Keating during the 1993 election campaign when he said it would be intolerable and improper to introduce a GST that would raise $22 billion. By the way, the GST would have had many offsetting benefits like the huge 19c per litre reduction in the price of petrol which would have massively benefited people in non-metropolitan Australia, rural Australians, many of whom were struggling against the disaster of drought and who had no other basic form of transport to rely on other than their motor vehicles. That GST policy would have resulted in an enormous reduction in country costs, and particularly costs of transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all remember not only the breach of faith in Mr Keating's rejection now of his promises to reduce tax but also we remember him saying, `These tax cuts are not just promises. They are l-a-w, law.' The `l', the `a' and the `w' were simply misplaced. Juggle them around a bit and we find that the tax cuts have gone AWL, absent without leave. If we insert an `o' in that we get AWOL. The `o' is what Australians have got out of these l-a-w tax laws&mdash;they have got zilch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While everyone has been concentrating on Mr Keating's breach of faith in winning the last election by deception, people have forgotten what he has done. I hope people realise that the $22 billion GST, which Mr Keating said was intolerable, has now been exceeded by Mr Keating's own tax rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Mr Keating, since the last election total tax collections have increased by $25 billion. What did Mr Keating say about a plan that would raise $22 billion and be mainly offset by other tax cuts? He said that it would be disgraceful to raise $22 billion, and yet, sneakily and secretly, he has added $25 billion to Australia's tax bill since the last election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That tax rise&mdash;the evidence of it is on page 4/57 of Budget Paper no. 1&mdash;shows an increase from $94 billion in the 1993-94 budget to $119.3 billion in this budget. The figures are getting to be so incredibly large that they are almost beyond normal comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took the Fraser government seven budgets to raise its total increase in taxes by $24 billion. In other words, Mr Keating, since the last election just two years ago, has increased the tax take more than the Fraser government did over the whole of its time in office. Mr Keating is the biggest taxing Prime Minister and/or Treasurer in Australia's history, and yet he went to the people at the last election swearing not only that there would be no increased taxes but also that taxes would be cut and that it is l-a-w. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that the Opposition is disgraceful for seeking to reform the tax system to reduce many taxes and then having an offsetting GST. The Prime Minister won that election on that totally dishonest campaign which has now been demonstrated to be crooked and which has been followed by a selection of tax rises far greater than the $22 billion included in the GST and far greater than the total increase in tax revenue over the whole of the Fraser period in government. The Prime Minister could do that&mdash;this low tax and tax cuts are l-a-w Prime Minister&mdash;and he could do that in the two budgets in the two years since the March 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should recognise that it is a bit worse than that, because the Medicare levy is not counted as a tax. It is, in fact, a tax&mdash;a tax to pay for part of the cost of medical care&mdash;and that levy has gone up, too. I have not included that in the $25 billion. I have not included the superannuation situation, because that superannuation arrangement is, in effect, a social security tax. It is a social security tax aimed at reducing the cost of payouts of social security by the Department of Social Security in the long run. It is not a voluntary method of saving; it is an effective social security tax. I have not included that in the record $25 billion increase in tax collections under Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No government in Australia's history has ever increased the tax take by as much as Mr Keating has in the last two years, and yet he went to an election promising tax cuts. What level of deception is involved in that? What political dishonesty! How disgraceful that this man, having done that, promises in this budget that, ultimately, there will be further benefits to Australians: just trust him. Trust him? After this performance? Most of the so-called benefits in this budget do not take place yet; they take place in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laura Tingle has a very perceptive article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. She points out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 and 1993, Paul Keating promised us around $14 billion of personal, company and other tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After last night's Budget, he will go to the next election having introduced new taxes worth $13.4 billion over the life of the current Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to leave us about lineball but in fact it does not; it leaves us a lot worse than that. Laura Tingle continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not include about $20 billion of increased taxation, which the Government has helpfully calculated as being raised in coming years but which (thankfully for Labor) only hit in the next parliamentary term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oh, and the Prime Minister will have only delivered about $9 billion worth of the tax cuts he promised us.</PARA>
<PARA>So she makes this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than being $14 billion better off in terms of tax collections&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, under the l-a-w law promises of Mr Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we are $18 billion worse off in terms of new taxes imposed, or tax cuts not given, on an increasingly rickety revenue system.</PARA>
<PARA>Instead of $14 billion better off, we are $18 billion worse off. That is a $32 billion turnaround involved in a total tax take of about $119 billion. That is an enormous proportion; it is an incredible proportion. As Laura Tingle says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes you wonder, really, why Keating fought so passionately to save us from the horrors of John Hewson's $22 billion GST.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new tax measures announced last night will raise $2.4 billion this coming financial year and $16.7 billion over the rest of the decade. That's $16.7 billion on top of the $10.168 billion in 1996-97 flowing out of the 1993 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there have been $27 billion in new taxes. That far exceeds the total of tax increases over the whole period of the Fraser government. Ms Tingle says that Mr Keating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is finishing this parliamentary term with the tax system looking like a dog's breakfast.</PARA>
<PARA>I would think it looks more like a dog's regurgitated breakfast. This is just unspeakable. But I might say that Mr Keating has returned, as one would expect&mdash;as I understand dogs do to their vomit&mdash;to the same system, the same structure, the same style of tax deception which he has not only practised as Treasurer but perfected as Prime Minister. Laura Tingle concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a bizarre situation where the political rhetoric says the electorate will not wear higher taxes, and we have been taxed to death in new ways for the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA>What intrigues me about this is that Laura Tingle seems to be the only political analyst who is a wake-up to it. Certainly, many of the political analysts have quite properly being dramatising the fact that Mr Keating has broken his tax promises. Mostly, they seem to say, `So what did you expect? Hasn't he always?' So it is not very exciting; it is not news that Mr Keating has broken a tax promise. It is anticipated; it is normal; it is taken for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laura Tingle's article here not only dramatises the sordid extent of Mr Keating's deception, but also indicates&mdash;when backed with these figures that are available in the budget&mdash;that Mr Keating is, by design, the biggest taxing Prime Minister in Australia's history. If he set out honestly and decently along that line to say, `Yes, I intend to increase your taxes; yes, I am honest enough to come to you to say that we think there should be a bigger tax burden,' at least we could accept that he had gone to the people on that basis. If he had been honest and said, `I am going to tax the pants off you; I am going to increase taxes by more than anyone ever has in the history of Australia,' at least people could then have made their decision at the last election, knowing that was what his policy was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But his policy was exactly the opposite. His policy was to oppose tax reform. His policy was to object to a system used in almost every other industrialised country in the world and to oppose it on a dishonest basis in such a way that one was given the clear impression by Mr Keating that, not only would he not introduce such a tax system, but he had tax cuts waiting for us because they were l-a-w law. I must say that it is not simply the company taxes which are going up. That has, of course, caused an immense furore in the company ranks because, after all, he had said during the last election that the reason company tax was to be cut was to make Australian companies more competitive with Asia. Of course, that has now been cancelled. We do not have to be competitive with Asia any more, apparently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on matters of public interest, I wish to raise just a couple of matters that have come to my attention in my role as the coalition's spokesman on regional development and infrastructure matters. I might say, just by way of a preliminary remark, that last night's budget again does nothing for regional Australia&mdash;it completely ignores regional Australia. The taxes that have been imposed, which will affect every Australian, do impact more heavily on those of us who live in that part of Australia remote from the capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a budget that really is a fraud. As my colleague Senator Michael Baume and others before me have said, it is a fudge-it budget, one that attempts to use mirrors and smokescreens to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate. Certainly as far as regional Australians go, it will be pay, pay, pay and no benefit whatsoever. The joke is that the Medicare levy goes up yet again, so regional Australians pay more for a health service which is very secondary and the government does nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my role as the shadow minister for infrastructure, I am disturbed that the Labor Party has sold capital assets to balance this year's current budget, has done nothing to retire long-term debt and has done nothing to reinvest some of those proceeds from the sale of capital assets back into capital assets which will bring a return to the nation. So certainly as far as regional Australia is concerned, this budget gets the very deliberate thumbs down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise a few other matters that have come to my attention as the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure and in my role as chairman of the coalition's regional task force. Very briefly, the first one I want to mention is the drought in Victoria. For some reason, Victorian farmers who are really very severely hit by the drought have been ignored by this government. A few weeks ago, a RASAC committee inspected the effects of the drought in the central Victorian region near Seymour. I was fortunate enough&mdash;although it was very distressing&mdash;to do the same tour and I looked at the same properties as the RASAC committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the area looks a little green, it is clearly in a drought situation. There is absolutely no feed and the farmers have some very distressing tales. These people on the land have had to put up with drought and with four or five years of negative income. So far this government has turned its back. I particularly congratulate and thank Mrs Fran Bailey for arranging my visit to the area and for pointing out the plight of these people to me, so that we could raise the matter. I certainly urge the government to do something to include those people in these grazing lands in central Victoria in the ambit of the drought relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another quite separate matter that I wish briefly to touch upon is the cost of accessing electronic information, particularly by people in regional Australia. I claim to have no expertise whatsoever in the electronic dissemination of information and this will probably become fairly obvious as I continue to speak. It has been told to me by users in regional Australia that they are getting a very bad deal from the Commonwealth government. As I understand it, not all information from Commonwealth government departments is available through the information technology. Where it is available, it is available through different agencies. I understand that ABS and the Bureau of Statistics are on Ausline, which is a contract of the federal government, whereas CSIRO and the Australian Securities Commission are available from other information providers and not from Ausline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of accessing federal government information is very high, particularly for regional people compared with other available services. It has been pointed out to me that the Queensland government&mdash;and I express some surprise at this&mdash;has an information provider called CITEC which is very good. All Queensland government information is available through CITEC and some Commonwealth information is available through CITEC. But the Commonwealth information available through CITEC is cheaper than it is through the Commonwealth government's preferred information dissemination agency. For people in regional Australia, particularly people who do not often access these information systems, the Commonwealth system is very discriminatory. I am told that a joining fee has to be paid of $145. Then there is a monthly service fee of $240; there are dial-up access charges; and there is a search service. The total cost of a single inquiry or just a couple of inquiries is very high. In one instance, as much as $413 was quoted to me. That is because the joining fee and the monthly service fee have to be paid whether the service is used 100 times or just once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland system, by comparison, is simply made available on a charge basis when people dial it up. They get a 008 number to get to the service, so it does not matter whether they are ringing from Brisbane, Sydney or Canberra, or from the far-flung regions of Queensland: the cost of accessing the information is exactly the same, so it is fair to people from regional Australia who want to access it. But the Commonwealth service is on a system where the further they are from the database, the more expensive it is, because they pay more or less the cost of a trunk line telephone call. The Queensland system, which uses a Freecall access device, is much fairer for regional Australia, so I would urge the federal government to have a look at that. I have had some correspondence with Senator Cook and Mr Lee about it. I might say that the responses I have had, which I have referred to people who know what they are talking about in this area, have not been well received. It has been suggested to me that the Commonwealth government is, as usual, being its inefficient self in this very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, the last thing I want to raise again relates to regional Australians. It is a matter that I have raised in estimates committees and had some correspondence with the government about, and it relates to the little town of Cardwell, near Hinchinbrook Island, on the North Queensland coast. Cardwell is a town that has had a pretty rough trot of it all the way through. Senators would be aware of the government's insensitive and quite stupid role in stopping work on the Port Hinchinbrook development site. That project would have provided hundreds and hundreds of jobs for that little community, which is in a very high unemployment area. I was in the area last Friday night. I am told that the development is not proceeding, in spite of Senator Faulkner yelling at me across the chamber that it is all going ahead. I understand that nothing has happened since last November-December, when Senator Faulkner stopped that work and cost all those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the local council has approved it. I might say that it is a council chaired by a Labor chairman: a good fellow, Councillor Tip Byrne. He is a Labor man, but you should hear what he has to say about it! Perhaps I had better not put him into the brine so much, but he is certainly not very pleased with his counterparts in the Labor Party and the role that they have played in this, because he knows what the project would mean to his shire just as everyone else does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not really the point that I want to make&mdash;although, as I say, Cardwell seems to do pretty poorly at the hands of the federal government. Not only is there that issue, there is the issue of the Battle of the Coral Sea Memorial Park. The people of Cardwell&mdash;just a group of very ordinary Australians&mdash;got together a few years ago without any government assistance and built a magnificent park on the mainland overlooking the Coral Sea athe point nearest to  where the Battle of the Coral Sea took place over 50 years ago. They have got out and made a magnificent park with a lot of individual memorials and many dedicated trees have been planted by descendants of the people who were involved in that battle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have never sought much from the government, but what they do ask for every year is that the Commonwealth government might allow some of the defence services&mdash;the army, the navy or the air force&mdash;to march in their parade. They had been granted that in previous years. They applied again this year, but this year they had no response. I tried to get in touch with the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, to get him to authorise it, but I did not even get a response to my letters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that I really wanted to talk about in relation to Cardwell and Hinchinbrook Island is a matter of public safety: in fact, in many instances, a matter of life and death. There have been instances in which lives have been lost along the Australian coast because there were not sufficient radiophone and seaphone facilities. There was recently an incident near Eden on the New South Wales coast where lives were lost because the environmental agencies of the Commonwealth government had refused to allow transmitters to be installed. That was fixed by the Commonwealth government. We have a similar situation on the coast near Hinchinbrook Island, where there was recently a search which had a lot of trouble because of the absence of a radio communication facility. I am not going to have enough time left to me to go into it in detail because it is almost Question Time, but I do urge the government to take some immediate action to ensure that a radiotelephone transmitter can be installed in that area to protect lives of Australians. </PARA>

After the massive fuel and sales tax slugs in the 1993-94 budget, I ask: why are you now imposing a 12 per cent sales tax on home building materials; increasing sales tax on cars by five per cent, adding a thousand dollars to the cost of an average car; increasing the company tax rate by three per cent; increasing tobacco excise by 10 per cent, adding 30c to the cost of a packet of cigarettes; ditching the l-a-w tax cuts; increasing the Medicare levy yet again; abolishing the sales tax exemption on recycled paper, and increasing migrant application fees by 40 per cent?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Hill's question is based as usual on a totally false premise which was that we made a promise not to make any tax increases at all. It will be remembered, as the Prime Minister said in parliament last December, that what he said in 1992&mdash;and you are welcome to go back and check the record&mdash;was that the government will be keeping tax within the tax to GDP ratio of the previous few years. It is the case that between 1989-90 and 1991-92 the tax to GDP ratio wobbled about between the range of 22.7 and 24.7. The budget estimates last night were that in 1995-96 tax revenue to GDP will be 24.2 per cent. That will increase to 24.6 per cent next year, still within that parameter, and then it will decline. The government is accordingly meeting that undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that a number of the revenue measures that have been introduced, particularly the one on cars, for example, were simply a matter of restoring a tax rate that had been reduced as an anti-recession measure to generate and encourage more spending in that particular area. It was not the expectation of anyone in the industry, or of anyone in the community, that that particular tax cut could be perpetually sustained. It is the case, of course, that the l-a-w tax cut, as you refer to it, will in fact be delivered as it was promised to be delivered.</PARA>

We know what the public sector in the United States is like in terms of its capacity to deliver effective infrastructure and social justice to all the people in that particular country. We would not as a nation want to have our revenues reduced to that level. We are the second lowest taxing country in the OECD, the industrialised world, the traditional standard of comparison.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a widespread consensus in Australia before the bringing down of the budget that it was necessary, if possible, to bring the budget into surplus, to address the problem of national savings and to continue what this government has achieved: strong economic growth with low inflation. The budget has delivered on all those things, thus meeting the expectation hurdles that were set up before the budget was brought down last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators  will know that it delivers a surplus of $718 million in this budgetary year which is, significantly, the largest ever turnaround in the deficit, bringing the budget into surplus three years faster than was originally forecast. While much has been made of the fact that there is a substantial asset sales program included in this budget, the point is that the budget will be in surplus next financial year by $3.4 billion net of asset sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a significant structural tightening&mdash;significant by any measure&mdash;with the turnaround from deficit to surplus being a change of $12.8 billion.

That is the best possible macro-economic setting for business to operate in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, there has been some criticism from the business sector of the increase in corporate tax. Any interest sector affected by budgetary change will criticise that change. But the overall macro-setting is strongly supported by industry. In private discussions I have heard with many of Australia's business leaders, what has come through quite clearly is that, while people do not want further tax changes to affect them, if there were a choice they would prefer it to go this way than to have what many of them see as pressure being put on interest rates, with a possibility of further interest rate rises down the track.

During the heat of the last election campaign, Paul Keating gave a solemn promise to the Australian electorate: `We remain committed to maintaining a majority stake in the Commonwealth Bank.' Last night, in what must rank as the lamest excuse ever put forward to justify electoral treachery, the Treasurer said the decision was made because `it was psychologically necessary to go into surplus.' Why was cabinet not consulted, let alone caucus? Why has there not been even a whimper from the so-called Left?

The Left within the Labor Party, being the responsible economic managers they are and having the keen understanding they do of economic realities and economic disciplines, completely understand that this was a rational and sensitive policy choice to make. The truth of the matter is, as Martin Ferguson said last night, whatever status the Commonwealth Bank might have had as a people's bank in yesteryear, it certainly has not had that status for the last 10 years or so. For all practical purposes, the Commonwealth Bank has been operating as an ordinary commercial bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been generating a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue from it annually, but the contribution that it has been making to our public debt interest obligations has exceeded that. We can make a much more substantial contribution to economic management, to improving the public sector savings position, by selling it. We made the decision to sell it for that reason. It is a decision that has been perfectly well understood within the Labor movement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to welcome Senator Jacinta Collins to the Senate and thank her for this very important question. As the agenda for the family shows, this government did what it set out to do in the International Year of the Family. It listened to families and it has responded to their concerns, especially the concerns expressed during that year. One of the things that people told us was that families were the most important factor in all of their lives. They also made it clear&mdash;and we recognise this&mdash;that families provide care as no government or any other agency can. The best thing governments can do is support families in the role that they play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said in the agenda, the greatest help government can give to families is a strong economy and the jobs and opportunities that go with it. The agenda contains initiatives that directly affect the needs of families. As Senator Collins alluded to, high on that list of benefits to families is the maternity allowance that will give women greater financial support particularly at the time of the birth of a baby. It is equivalent to six weeks of the parenting allowance that is currently worth $816.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with that major initiative there are major increases to assist families in juggling work and family responsibilities. To help them do that the government has continued the growth in child care, particularly in freeing up 31,000 child-care places by better targeting child-care funding to working families and ensuring at the same time that families with a parent at home have access to significant occasional care. For many families that will be a significant increase in their occasional care.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I should say about this is that the way in which we have calculated the deficit&mdash;or, in this case, the surplus of $718 million&mdash;is consistent with the conventions and criteria laid down by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations for calculating these figures. That is the absolute truth, Senator. It is the same method by which we calculated the budget deficit last year&mdash;a deficit, as you will recall, of $12.8 billion. It puts us into a surplus this year of $718 million and a surplus the following year, 1996-97, of $3.4 billion, which is the largest turnaround in the budget in the history of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say this was done with revenue two per cent lower than when the budget was last in surplus. But the true difference here, in differentiating between the figures that you have given us and the figure of $718 million surplus, is that people take the budget deficit or the budget surplus to be what call on financial markets the Commonwealth will make. That is the important criterion. The answer to that is that we are not making a call on the financial markets because we are in surplus this financial year.</PARA>

It refers to a figure of $8 billion for 1995-96, but you ought to read the introduction to this to get an understanding of what the adjusted underlying deficit is. The important thing here though is that if you compare the year 1994-95 with the forthcoming budget year of 1995-96, what we have set out to achieve structurally&mdash;a significant fiscal tightening to take pressure off interest rates and to keep inflation low&mdash;is achieved. These figures report a $7 billion turnaround or a $7 billion reduction in that deficit.</PARA>

That is the figure that we have given in both the budget speech and in the budget papers, and it is a proper and accurate reflection under all the international conventions for the compilation of budgets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth will provide more than $220 million in 1995 to fund a range of programs in the environment portfolio. This represents an increase of 21 per cent on last year's funding for the environment. By any measure, that is an excellent budget outcome for the environment. The budget includes extra funding for a range of carefully targeted, carefully integrated new programs to protect some of our most precious natural assets.

There are also initiatives to encourage the collection and recycling of high-grade wastepaper, including a major effort to increase paper recycling from government offices. It will provide improved conservation and management for Australia's wetlands. It will provide extra research and monitoring to look after the Great Barrier Reef, which is, of course, under significant increased pressure from tourism.

The most effective thing a government can deliver for small business&mdash;the interests of the small business community are to the fore in the government's mind&mdash;is a strong macro-economic outcome and an outcome of sustainable growth. We have had to make adjustments to the taxing regime in the business area. I also point out that all of our small business support programs that go to skilling and helping business to be more competitive and giving better market intelligence are intact and providing a dividend in making small business more competitive.

That is not to mention the full tax imputation provisions, which remain intact for small business. They enable small business to effectively absorb some of the taxing costs that are occurring in this budget. All those things still create an environment for long-term sustainable growth of which small business will be a major part.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In shorthand, the government has made three changes in the export assistance area as it relates to my portfolio. Firstly, there was the announcement of continued funding of the export access program, which I have to say has been very well received by business associations and the business community. Secondly, we have introduced an export pre-qualification test for new export market development grant claimants. Thirdly, we have reduced the maximum grant under EMDG from $250,000 to $200,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Childs says, support for business in its export activities, particularly small to medium enterprises, is very important and the EMDG program is a key element of that. When you get the need for fiscal restraint imposed upon you, it requires all programs to come under review and consideration. The last thing we needed to do was have another review of EMDG in the formal sense; it has been reviewed to death over the years. So we set out to examine the options developed by those various reviews and see how we could ensure that we were getting maximum value for money out of the taxpayers' dollar and make sure the program is being focused on its principal objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review certainly made it clear in the past that we were getting big export dollars in return for outlays. As I recall, in the report that I outlined to the Senate last year, the ratio was something like 25 to 1&mdash;$25 of exports for every dollar spent on EMDG. But we always need to keep these things under review. The government will continue to give substantial support to SMEs through the EMDG scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was treating that as an interjection, which is a more proper characterisation, I think, of the nature of it. The reason we are going down this particular path and not spending the second tranche of the tax cuts in that way but rather diverting that government payout in other directions is that, taking into account all the needs of the Australian economy and needs of individual Australians, those point towards going down this particular path. Obviously it would be desirable, from the point of view of self-funded retirees, to be able to deliver them tax cuts. But there are lots of things that are desirable that are simply not attainable and not achievable. There are more immediate priorities in terms of the economic needs of this nation and in terms of the needs of other retirees in this country who have hitherto had to simply rely on pensions and who badly needed some form of supplementation of this particular kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be remembered that this is the government that actually brought forward the first round of the One Nation tax cuts and, together with the additional rebate for low income earners that we delivered in the 1993-94 budget, actually delivered substantially more to taxpayers&mdash;all taxpayers, including self-funded retirees&mdash;from the first round of tax cuts than was in fact promised before the 1993 election. That has conveniently dropped out of your rhetoric, Senator O'Chee, but that is the truth of the matter. We delivered more in that first round and this other measure than was the case in the promise before the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deferring the second tranche of the tax cuts was extremely widely understood and accepted by the Australian community because it took place against the background of an immensely difficult task of fiscal consolidation that we faced. It was stated in the 1993-94 budget that those cuts would be deferred until fiscal conditions permitted, probably in 1998. I do not think there were too many people who were looking with absolute certainty to the achievement of those cuts in 1998. Certainly, Senator O'Chee's rhetoric before this budget suggests that it was inevitable that those would disappear completely off the horizon. They have not disappeared completely; they have just been rediverted down a different channel, a channel which is far more economically responsible and a tremendously significant response to the needs of the Australian national economy at this particular point of time.</PARA>

<PARA>I am intrigued to note that Senator Gareth Evans has tried to justify the Labor Party's deception on tax. It promised no tax rises. In fact, it promised l-a-w tax cuts on the phoney grounds that Senator Evans presented; that some range of tax to GDP was not only implied but clearly stated at the time of the election. When the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said there would be no increase in tax he meant no increase in the range of tax in proportion to GDP that had existed over some vague period. That is not only bunkum, that is disgraceful bunkum; and no wonder Senator Evans looked so embarrassed in question time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me assure him he is wrong. Just as tax l-a-w has turned into tax A-W-L, absent without leave, his tax statements are w-r-o-n-g. The proportion of tax to GDP&mdash;that is, total tax revenues&mdash;in 1993, at the time of the dishonest election campaign the Labor Party ran when it said it would reduce taxes, was 22.1 per cent. That is evidenced on page 4/61 of the budget papers. That amount in this budget is now up to 24.2 per cent, a very substantial rise, despite the assurance and word of honour&mdash;I use the word loosely&mdash;of the Prime Minister that there would be no increase in tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans, if you want to say, `We meant it only as a proportion of GDP,' let me underline to you that that proportion was 22.1 per cent. You have now increased it massively to 24.2 per cent. It is not just a tax on companies or somebody else, it also hits the ordinary PAYE taxpayers who have contributed almost half the increase in those taxes. The statement by the Prime Minister at that election campaign was dishonest. No kind of fudge-it budget or weasel words by Senator Evans can avoid the fact that at the last election, this government and Prime Minister went to the polls promising no increased tax; and the tax cuts were l-a-w law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you, Senator Evans, that in the last two budgets alone you have brought about an increase in tax revenues of $25 billion, the biggest rise over two years in Australian history. It is more than the total tax rise over the whole period of the Fraser government. In the last two budgets you have brought in a bigger tax rise than you said&mdash;in your phoney claims on the GST&mdash;the GST would impose on the Australian people. You claimed&mdash;and you stood by your Prime Minister when he claimed&mdash;that the total cost of the GST would be $22 billion.

What he said in parliament last December&mdash;and he was referring to what he said in 1992&mdash;was that the government would be keeping tax within the tax to GDP ratio of the previous few years. The truth of the matter is that you do not take just one individual year but a series of years. Between 1989-90 and 1991-92, the tax to GDP ratio was between 22.7 and 24.7.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was not ever a matter of referring to the tax to GDP ratio or proportion in any particular year and saying that there will be no increase.

The 1995 outlays figure for Australia on our own Treasury estimates is 35.9 per cent of GDP, and the OECD estimate is a little larger at 36.6. The comparison is with the United States, which at 33.6 per cent is the only one below us. On the OECD figure, Japan is also lower at 36 per cent. Thereafter for other countries it ranges from Germany, on 48.6 per cent, all the way up to Sweden, on 67.3 per cent, as a proportion of GDP to outlays.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was a quite considered, detailed and statistically accurate presentation of the tax arrangements and how the tax changes have occurred. The opposition has studiously avoided reference to the major aims of the budget. While the opposition was part of a chorus of voices before budget day calling for a surplus, it is now part of a minority chorus trying to attack the level of the surplus. The reason is that this is the biggest turnaround from deficit to surplus in one budget in the history of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in answer to a question today from Senator Kernot, what the individual in the street regards as a deficit is the Commonwealth's call on financial markets. The figures set out in our budget papers show that we are in surplus in this budgetary year to the tune of $718 million. Those figures are calculated according to the criteria and conventions laid down by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. There is no rubber there. There is strict adherence to international calculations for the preparation of these sorts of statistics, and you cannot get away from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The achievement of a surplus&mdash;something that has rightly surprised the markets and something that has gained currency in the markets as trading today has progressed&mdash;is an outstanding achievement by this government. The opposition will want to tear that down. Success does not suit the opposition. Failure or inability to deliver is what the opposition craves. Agony and pain for ordinary Australians is what the opposition craves because it believes that is the basis upon which it might be re-elected. Unfortunately for the opposition, but fortunately for the rest of us, that will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major achievement of this budget is that we now have a medium-term national savings plan. We have heard precious little from the opposition about superannuation arrangements, and part of the reason for that is that these superannuation arrangements recognise the earlier promise of tax cuts delivered by the Prime Minister but come in the form of matching grants to workers' superannuation to ensure that there is a decent and respectable retirement income for ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night, when delivering the budget speech on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), I pointed out that before Labor came to office only 35 or 40 per cent of Australians had superannuation at all. They were people in white-collar jobs; they were certainly not people in blue-collar jobs. The workers of this country did not have superannuation. One of the great reforms of this government is that now 90 per cent of male workers and 85 per cent of female workers in this country have superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is now ensuring that when those people in their mid-30s eventually retire they will have their pension plus 75 per cent of their pension as a superannuation benefit. To achieve that 75 per cent, the tax cuts referred to earlier by the Prime Minister will be rediverted as matching grants to workers' contributions to superannuation, beginning year 1997. That will be an outstanding turnaround in terms of the ability of people in retirement to live at a dignified level. But in terms of the national pool of savings, it will generate something like tenfold the current $186 billion tied up in workers superannuation in Australia. So a huge pool of investment through national savings is being generated and addressing the most outstanding issue in our current account and our economic structure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point at issue in this debate is whether the government lied its way back into government in 1993, with the lies flowing through in the budget decisions that have been taken since then. That is what this issue is all about. The government went to the 1993 election with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself putting his own personal imprimatur on it all, promising $14 billion of tax cuts. That is what won him the 1993 election. People stupidly thought that he might deliver on his promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened since the 1993 election is that, instead of $14 billion of tax cuts, we have seen $18 billion of tax increases. That is the thrust of the opposition's concern about the morality of last night's budget. We should set aside the economics of it&mdash;which are rotten economics. The simple fact, and I repeat it, is that the government lied to the Australian people before the 1993 election about what it was going to do with taxes. It claimed it was going to massively decrease taxes. It has even more massively increased them. It did not just happen last night. It has happened in each of the budgets since the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might remember, Mr Temporary Chairman, that in 1993, just a few months after that federal election, the Dawkins budget increased sales tax, despite a promise to the contrary; deferred the much vaunted personal income tax cuts that had been promised; and massively raised the petrol excise. Over four years those extra imposts imposed following the 1993 election will result in increased tax revenue of over $11 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done it again this year. The Prime Minister has broken his promise on company tax. He was to lower company tax to 33 per cent. He did so for a year or so. Now it has gone up by almost 10 per cent in this budget to a rate of 36 per cent. He has broken his promise not to increase the Medicare levy. It went up last night. He has broken his promise to pay the second tranche of the l-a-w, law, personal income tax cuts. First of all, a couple of budgets ago the government deferred the tax cuts from 1996 to 1998. It did that in the 1993 budget. Now it has abandoned them altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has broken his promise to not increase indirect taxes. The government increased sales tax by two per cent in the 1993 budget. Last night, it put an extra five per cent on cars. It will now cost an extra $1,000 per car. It has broken its promise to not expand the indirect tax base. What did we get last night? Building materials will be taxed at 12 1/2 per cent, which will add something like $2,000 or more to the price of a house. All those decisions last night and in the 1993 budget are the absolute opposite of what was promised by the government before the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is trying to convince the Australian public that the deficit figure for this year is not really a deficit but a surplus of $700 million. We all know what a fraud that is. Take the underlying budget. The government is very keen on using the word `underlying'. It does it in relation to the inflation rate. Hidden away at the back of the budget papers is a figure showing an $8.3 billion deficit for this year. It is not a surplus. That is what this debate today has been about. That is what the opposition was asking about in question time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night's budget is one of the greatest increased tax grabs in Australia's history, which adds to the unparalleled list of broken promises of this deceitful Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget completely fails to tackle the essential restructuring of the government's finances. It reduces the living standards of virtually every Australian. It makes no inroads at all into Australia's huge deficit in its external accounts. It puts off into the distant future, into the never-never, some of it as far away as 30 years, any potential benefits. Of course, we all know what that means&mdash;they will never be delivered. Furthermore, and most disturbingly, the budget hit business badly, thereby endangering investment, demand, jobs and future growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the business sector, small business, the lifeblood of our economy, will be hit particularly hard. I say to you, Madam Deputy President&mdash;it is a great pleasure to have my first opportunity to call you that&mdash;that small business plays an enormously important role in this respect in the Australian economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has estimated that there are over 850,000 small businesses in Australia. That is 95 per cent of all businesses. Together, they employ over 2.8 million Australians; around 40 per cent of the total work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has absolutely nothing to offer these people. On the contrary, it contains a number of highly regressive measures which damage small business. Small business already, of course, has been decimated in many areas by the policies of this government over many years. Indeed, in the last four years alone, there have been 70,000 small business bankruptcies. As my colleague Senator Campbell pointed out last night following the budget, the damaging impact of the budget measures on small business will throttle the opportunity for employment by the most employment-creating sector, the small business sector of the economy, at a time when youth unemployment in Australia is still at tragically high levels. </PARA>

That will have a very adverse impact on all Australian companies. It will damage their cashflow and reduce their scope for investment, thereby limiting employment and growth prospects. </PARA>

That was a promise to reduce the company tax rate to 33 per cent. That rate of 33 per cent was going to continue into the distant future, but two years later it is put back to 36 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Knowles said, the government only did it to try to match our policy. The government, unlike the opposition, did it in a totally unfunded way. We said at the time that the government's reduction was not sustainable. It was another fraud because it was paid for by businesses out of brought-forward tax instalments. It was never going to be a sustainable measure. That was another lie by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Business Council of Australia is not a representative of small business, it has described the increase in company tax as `an attack on jobs which will reduce the funds available for investment and job creation. This comes at a time when there is a slowdown in business activity, especially in the small and medium sectors'. So, just when the small firms need the money from past profits, it will be taken away by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, higher corporate regulation scheme fees will also hit incorporated small businesses. Those 300,000-plus small businesses will have to pay their fair share of the $51 million to be raised over four years from this increase. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the six per cent increase in sales tax on motor vehicles&mdash;which is going to produce almost $1.5 billion in additional tax over four years, provided car sales do not collapse again; there is every prospect that they will as a result of this measure&mdash;will also hit small business very hard. It is another Labor election deception. It will add $1,000 to the price of a Falcon or a Commodore. Small firms that require the use of a car for their very survival will have no chance of upgrading their cars. This will add a further cost to business. As the Taxation Institute has said, this measure will `be an unwarranted blow against the struggling motor vehicle industry, including the thousands of small manufacturers that make components'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the new 12 per cent sales tax on building materials will hit small business very heavily. Small businesses are the backbone of the building industry; an industry that is already under very severe pressure due to the government's economic policies, particularly the surge in interest rates over the last few months. Those interest rates are once again amongst the highest real levels of interest rates in the western world. This measure will be an added blow. It will cost prospective buyers and renovators between $1,000 and $3,000 for each home.

It is a specialty. They both hate subcontractors. They have attacked them through the industrial relations system. With the might of the tax office, they are going to whack them again. Whilst no estimate of the cost of that measure is included in the budget&mdash;probably because it is not a revenue initiative but rather an ideological assault&mdash;it will, nonetheless, have a significant impact. The increased compliance revenue, the lowering of the threshold for early PAYE remittances and the banking licences and supervision fees which will add to the cost of banking and the cost of business for small businesses will also have a significant impact. </PARA>

Rather than attacking assumptions about employment growth, falling unemployment and a rise in living standards, or the attempts in the budget to reduce interest rates, inflation and the current account, we have this rather absurd matter of public importance submitted by the opposition. The MPI states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's failure to understand the critical importance of small business to jobs and economic prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the opposition has to offer on the day after the budget, at its first chance to get stuck into the government and to put its alternative propositions for the future economic directions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In reply to Senator Brownhill's contribution, I refer him to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of today's date headed `Explosion in birth of small businesses.' It is interesting to note that the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> tends to contradict some of Senator Brownhill's evidence. The article mentions a study by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu which refers to the large growth in small business in the last couple of years in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on some of the larger issues in the economic debate. I think the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are to be congratulated for making sure that the budget did address those major issues. What the opposition has failed to understand is that the major problem confronting small businesses is the cost of their inputs. The biggest problem most of the small businesses I talked to have is servicing their debt. What this budget is about is taking the pressure off interest rates for both businesses and families so that they can service that debt, borrow and allow their businesses to grow and therefore employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is targeted very much at reducing any pressure on interest rate rises that exist in the economy. The opposition has been talking about this issue for some time. I am very surprised that it has failed to acknowledge the importance of that thrust within the budget. As I said, small businesses face real pressure from any rise in interest rates. I think it has been conceded that the budget does a great deal to reduce pressure on interest rates. That will prove to be a key to business success and to its ability to generate employ ment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other input of vital importance to small business is wages policy and the cost of wages. I am pleased to say that, as part of this budget process, the government will be negotiating with the ACTU accord mark 8, which will manage growth in the economy and wages outcomes to keep sustainable economic growth. This budget is about continuing sustainable economic growth and rising employment, and keeping inflation under control. The accord mark 8 will be a boon to businesses because the two major input costs that they face&mdash;interest rates and wages policy&mdash;will be managed and will relieve pressure on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will then be able to deal better with one of the imposts that arise from the budget on which the opposition has concentrated, and that is the rise in company tax. Company tax is a tax on their profits at the end of the process and has much less effect, as Senator Schacht pointed out, than imposts on their inputs. The company tax increase will have some impact, but it is part of a package. The package has reduced the imposts on small business. I think overall it is a good result for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He wonders why we do not ask questions. There is a very simple answer to that question. It is because he simply cannot answer the questions. Everything that he has touched he has messed up. Small business is a classic example of that. In last night's budget, there was not one incentive for small business. The sales tax and company tax increases contained in this budget are the last smack in the mouth that small business needs. This government does not worry about small business. This government subjected small business to the worst recession in 60 years. Who was engineer of the worst recession in 60 years? The Prime Minister&mdash;Paul Keating. He was the one who did that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Short has said, so many small businesses have gone broke over the 13 years of Labor government. Many of them have struggled to survive, have seen five minutes of sunshine and have been hit with further increases in sales tax and further increases in company tax. Senator Chris Evans just said, `But company tax is only paid on profit. It does not matter.' What he does not understand, because he has never run a business and has never had to understand it, is that the way in which people employ and stay in business is by making a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless they make a profit they go broke but you do not understand that. You do not understand the basics. Along with the record levels of bankruptcy, of course, there were record levels of unemployment because small business, given the right circumstances, is Australia's largest employer. But does that matter to this government with this budget? No! All they have done is increase taxes on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last election, this cheating and lying government sought to match our policies to provide the tax cuts now known as the l-a-w or l-i-e tax cuts by reducing company tax and the tax on cars. All that was done purely and simply to match Fightback. The government had no intention whatsoever of keeping those tax cut promises or the reduction in other taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the aborting of the l-a-w or l-i-e tax cuts, we now see the increases in company tax and the tax on motor vehicles, which will of course affect company cars and the motor vehicle industry. And the motor vehicle industry has always been in a fairly delicate position in this country. Does it matter to this government? No! Overnight they just whack a tax on new cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will that do to the manufacturing and retailing motor vehicle industry? The retail industry is a large employer as well and there will now be many more people who cannot afford to buy a new car, to say nothing of the companies which have fleet cars and which will not be able to pay the extra sales tax that this government has just thrown at their door today. For example, those industries will be very badly affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us look at another significant employer and small business industry. The building industry has been struggling for years. Senator Murphy looks terribly puzzled. I can understand his bewilderment because he does not understand the business. The building industry is a very large employer. The building industry started to see a bit of an increase in home construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, since the interest rates have gone up and now that there is further uncertainty as to where interest rates are going&mdash;because, let us face it, you guys do not know; you do not have the faintest idea of where interest rates are going&mdash;there has already been a decline in home building. What did the government do last night? It put a sales tax on previously exempt building products that will add $2,500 to the cost of a $100,000 home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not too many places around Australia where you can buy a $100,000 home. It should be noted, for those who might read this debate at a later date or who might be listening to it at the moment, that Senator Murphy is roaring with laughter at that prospect. He obviously does not care one iota about all the young people who are desperately trying to get their foot on the first rung of the ladder to buy a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people cannot even manage to save the 20 per cent deposit, purely and simply because the under-25s are the ones that these people opposite have put into unemployment limbo. The under-25s are suffering the highest record of unemployment&mdash;and there is so much job uncertainty. Those poor young people whom we should be encouraging to buy homes have been hit again because the government has just widened the gap further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has widened the gap on the cost of the home and widened the gap on the deposit they need to get by increasing bank charges. The increase in bank charges will hit them as well but that does not matter to the government&mdash;it does not seem to care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at fuel excise, which has taken off in the 13 years of this government. Prior to the last election the government promised that we would not have any increases in tax. It is worth reminding the Senate that at the time of the last election fuel tax was 26.2c a litre; by February 1994 it was 30.75c a litre, or 31.75c a litre for leaded petrol; and by February this year and now it is 32.5c or 34.57c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not understand that that adds to the cost of everything that is transported in a commercial and private sense. But that does not matter to you. It is absolutely scandalous that this government has neglected small business yet again, does not understand the problems that it is facing and seems to care not about those who can and should be employed by the small business sector. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that small business is the major employer in this country. The majority of employment growth in the last year or two has been in small and medium enterprises. A lot of the economic upturn has been from gross domestic product generated in small business. We also know of the problems with taxation compliance that small business faces. We know about the emphasis on big business, big projects, which are assisted while small business is left to fend for itself in a system stacked against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about slowing down the economy, or cooling it off, we mean mainly we must sock it to small business. These are the people who get hit first and hardest with declines in consumer confidence and by increased interest rates. These are people, often ordinary couples, who have managed to scrape enough together to get a business going. They generally try to start these during good times, since even established small business suffers during recessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Established businesses also take an upturn as a good chance to buy stock and equipment that was run down over the hard times, or to expand. Much of this is financed through loans and so small business is heavily affected by increased interest rates, both through declines in consumer spending and through increased demands on what profits they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax regime also has a heavy impact on small business. It is not so much the rate of tax, although there are equity issues here, since small business often has far less opportunity to take advantage of tax minimisation schemes, while big corporations can employ several tax experts just to work out ways to do so. What is more important is the cost, often in time and effort, of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the tax regime moving increasingly towards self-assessment to reduce government expenses and employment. We now expect each small business to comprehend and act with perfect assumption of knowledge in regard to the mess that is our tax legislation. If they fail, or make a mistake, they are held entirely responsible. This budget estimates the ATO will make the government an extra $150 million this year in compliance improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While no-one wants to excuse or tolerate tax cheats, we have the situation where big business has the opportunity to minimise tax, while small business is expected to be a tax expert and is ruthlessly pursued and treated as a cheat if it makes a mistake. Not only does small business spend eight, 10 or more hours a week at the book, it lives in terror of a tax audit, although it may be trying to do everything properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also little doubt that if the federal government were serious about enabling regional and rural communities to seek out viable solutions to their economic problems, it would not be cutting back spending on local employment and training initiatives. It would realise that the cargo cult mentality of paring down costs and standards to the bone to attract international investment from overseas in capital intensive resource extracting industry is not likely to solve these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The least any federal government should do is to acknowledge local initiatives that are working to create economic diversity and new employment opportunities even if they are breaking the rules by producing for the local market. </PARA>

One measure of confidence is the fact that in 1994&mdash;this is not something we have made up&mdash;the level of business investment was at a record high. That is forecast to increase by 18 per cent, in year average terms, during the remainder of 1994-95 and by 13 per cent in 1995-96.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report looks unambiguously to the future of Australian-Vietnamese relations. It endeavours in all respects to be constructive, deliberate and purposeful. It seeks to influence policy, not only in this country but in Vietnam, on a range of issues&mdash;political, economic, social and cultural, particularly in respect of human rights&mdash;and it seeks to carry opinion, not only within the legislature but beyond, to the broad Australian community, having particular regard to the Australian Vietnamese community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a privilege to have led the delegation. It is a very great privilege to deliver this report this afternoon, particularly in respect of the fact that I know there is much interest in it here and beyond, but also because the report is a unanimous document. It represents a consensus view arrived at by the delegation, which itself reflected all shades of opinion within the Australian parliament and within the community beyond. It was a very able delegation and it was a pleasure to lead it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative to send an Australian delegation to Vietnam to obtain a balanced and objective picture of developments in that country and, in particular, to initiate a substantial dialogue on human rights issues, stemmed from a meeting on 27 May 1993 between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Vietnamese Prime Minister, Mr Vo Van Kiet. While an earlier planned visit was unfortunately cancelled due to circumstances at the time and as a result of major changes to the itinerary originally planned for the delegation, negotiations were able to be resumed and the 1995 delegation was the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian parliamentary consultative delegation to Vietnam was the first of its kind. It has succeeded in opening a dialogue between the two countries on matters of common interest and concern. The delegation was a framework delegation, exploring a range of political, economic and cultural issues, especially human rights, in an effort not only to outline Australian perspectives but also to make a realistic contribution to the development of ties, institutional and otherwise, between Australia and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that our hosts were at pains to make sure that we had access, at senior levels, to official channels through which to pursue those matters which we wished to discuss. This enabled our delegation to raise a range of issues across the broad spectrum of concerns, interests and aspirations. From time to time exchanges were robust but discussions were always valuable. No issue was regarded as too difficult, either by the delegation or by our interlocutors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anyone think that we were confined to official channels, our delegation was able to make contact with a wide range of people, well beyond official structures and who were independent of government channels. In that respect I would like to thank my fellow delegates but I pay particular tribute to the Vietnamese members of the Australian delegation&mdash;Professor Trang Thomas, Ms Mai Ho, and Mr Phong Bui&mdash;who were outstanding in broadening contact. In respect of the contact we had with the dissident family in Ho Chi Minh City, Ms Mai Ho and Professor Trang Thomas were again instrumental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As people may conclude, we were able to discuss issues with critics, intellectual and otherwise, of some aspects of Vietnamese government policy. Our delegation also found it possible to mix with representatives of international agencies&mdash;for example, UNHCR and UNICEF&mdash;with the Australian business community, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City, and with the diplomatic corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This wide range of contact has enabled the delegation to make a comprehensive assessment of the changes which are occurring in Vietnam and just what those changes mean for the future, not only for our bilateral relationship but also for the region. It has also allowed the delegation to focus on Australia's approach and the role which we should continue to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full program of the delegation is attached to the report which I am tabling this afternoon, but I will just give the Senate some idea of the range of discussions. There were discussions with the ministries of foreign affairs, interior, justice, labour; the Supreme People's Court; the Chief Procurator of Ho Chi Minh City; government committees for religious affairs, children and ethnic minorities; the General Confederation of Labour; and the Women's Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited a prison at Phu Son, talked with prison officials and, perhaps more significantly, with a number of prisoners. The delegation also met with representatives of the Catholic and Buddhist churches, private lawyers, intellectuals and political critics. Importantly, as I have mentioned, Vietnamese-Australian members of the delegation were able to move freely without escort and to meet and talk with ordinary Vietnamese citizens in all walks of life. We were also able, of course, to talk with expatriate Australians in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of the report is as outlined. It looks at an overview of the objectives and at the historical, political, legal and economic context, which is essential for an understanding of the current situation. It looks then at specific issues. We then move to particulars, with the visit to the Phu Son prison. We look then, in great detail, at the circumstances of returned asylum seekers&mdash;the delegation having spent a day in Dong Nai looking at those particular situations. Again, I mention the contact that we were able to have with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the conclusions which we were able to draw as a result of our experiences, contact and discussions, there is no doubt that the war years remain a significant feature of Vietnamese political culture. In everything from expression, by way of the contact with the national assembly through to the literature. It has resulted in a strong sense of independence and national pride and a reserve in respect of any suggestion of dictation by outsiders. But, having said that, there is no question either that Vietnam is very much a country in transition. Since the initiation of the doi moi economic reform program, there have been major changes in Vietnam's approach to economic management. The doctrines of Marxism and Leninism, as they apply in terms of the economic future of Vietnam, are in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there has been some relaxation of political control over private behaviour, but there is a very long way to go in terms of a number of human rights issues, and we deal with those in detail in the report. We focus, in particular, on the consequences of the international instruments to which Australia and Vietnam are both signatories&mdash;and I am thinking in terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that which applies to economic, social and cultural rights and the ILO conventions&mdash;and also in respect of international instruments which Vietnam has not yet signed and which appear to be under some degree of consideration within Vietnamese government circles at the moment. In particular, I draw attention to the convention on torture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a general belief that, in so far as the transitional circumstances are concerned, economic reform is irreversible. There is an expectation that social and political changes will also continue to take place. The specifics did not always emerge but the general trend was very clear. It appeared to my mind that the Vietnamese government and those in leading positions in political and economic offices had looked very carefully at the collapse of the Soviet bloc and had looked even more carefully at other experiences in Asia. In expressing the personal view, as distinct from the view of the delegation&mdash;although Senator Bourne might agree&mdash;I think that the Vietnamese government appears to have embraced something akin to a Taiwanese model for future economic development and political circumstances. There appears to be a degree of tolerance in respect of private expression of political or other views, but there seems to be little tolerance of public or organised dissent. The cases of imprisonment, for example, a degree of harassment of which the delegation was made aware, demonstrate that fact beyond satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In respect of the legal system overall though, there is no doubt that there is a great deal of change occurring and Australia will play a role in overhauling the code that applies to investment, the labour code and other aspects of future legal circumstances. We argue in our conclusions for a future cooperating for justice program. We argue that very specifically. We believe that is a very purposeful role that we can play. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Loosley's motion. I, too, was on the delegation, and I must say I found a very different Vietnam to the one that I found when I was there about three years ago. The differences I found in Vietnam&mdash;and I must say I am not an expert on Vietnam, and please nobody listening take me as such&mdash;are that in those three years Vietnam seems to have become far more bustling, more open, particularly in the south as we were coming from the airport into Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, as almost everybody still calls it. They say it because it is shorter than Ho Chi Minh City. As we were coming in, we saw Telecom phone boxes which had been put there by Telstra Australia and which took phone cards, and that was something completely different from what I expected, having been there three years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic liberalisation that began with the introduction of doi moi in 1986 has led inexorably to a different Vietnam. Along with Chris Sidoti, one of the other members of this delegation, I was a member of the two Australian human rights delegations to China, which took place, I think, in 1991 and 1992. The differences between our reception in Vietnam and our reception in China on the first instance were very marked. In Vietnam, for instance, on this side the Vietnamese accepted that what we were doing was appro-</PARA>
<PARA>priate. They accepted that, when we mentioned human rights, that was a legitimate matter for discussion. It was part of the bilateral relationship and, in fact, much of the program, as Senator Loosley has said, did focus on human rights. By comparison, when we went to China, the first time in particular, at almost every meeting we were told right at the beginning for a considerable length of time why we really should not be there and why what we were doing was totally inappropriate. If we heard that speech once, we must have heard it 20 times. That did not happen on this visit, and I was very pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, even though there have been rapid and dramatic economic changes, there are still, of course, basic problems in Vietnam, and we address them, I think, probably most succinctly in conclusion No. 9.6, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there appears to be no repression of the private expression of political or other views at variance with those of the regime&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Loosley has said, and I really want to agree with him on this, views were expressed in many places. I do not want to get our Vietnamese-Australian members of the delegation into trouble for saying this, but they were instrumental in going out and talking to people on the streets and in shops. They included dissidents and a lot of people that we otherwise would not have been able to have contact with. They were able to speak with these people, and I hope I am reporting them accurately when I say that they found people in the majority were willing to speak about political differences in private. But when you look at what happens with public expression of dissenting views, there are very harsh penalties. There are gaol sentences. Amnesty International tells us that there are still at least 60 prisoners of conscience and possible prisoners of conscience being held in Vietnam. These people are in gaol in Vietnam because they disagree with the views put forward by the communist party of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal system treats dissidents very harshly. Penal provisions are broadly worded, so in many cases people are not quite sure whether they are going against the law. The judicial system gives little scope for acquittal. Once people are in court, in 99.9 per cent of cases they will be convicted. When they are convicted, the gaol terms are really quite lengthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The churches form the other area that we looked at most considerably. Basically, people must strictly adhere to a religious faith. For example, it is fine for people to go to mass in the Catholic Church as long as it is a really traditional mass. That is of great comfort to many people in Vietnam, and so it should be. It is also fine for those who want to follow the religious faith of Buddhism quietly to do so in the proper Buddhist church. Those who go across the line could get into very big trouble, and many people do. Religious observance is one area where many people get into trouble in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take too much longer. I will say a few things about the people on the delegation. Senator Loosley led our delegation extremely well. I have always found him to be very good on human rights. I felt that he was very good on this delegation. I must admit that before I went I really was not quite sure what I would find, but I was very impressed by the way that Mr Downer also led the delegation. Both men were sensible, conciliatory and reasonable at all times. We all got on very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Nancy Viviani was also on the delegation. I think I can say the same of her; she was sensible. Nobody went beyond the line. Everybody on that delegation knew exactly where the line was. They pushed it occasionally, but they never went beyond it. Mr Chris Sidoti and I are the only two people who had been to both China and Vietnam on similar delegations. He is an asset to any human rights undertaking. Senator Loosley will agree with me when I say that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that our two Vietnamese-Australian members outside the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were under a lot of pressure in Australia before they went. It did not make it easy for them. When they went to Vietnam, they behaved absolutely impeccably. In a couple of cases, I would even say that they behaved heroically. They said things that they did not think would be treated comfortably by our hosts. In a couple of cases, people were surprised at their forthrightness. But they never went beyond the line. They were always very strong in what they were asking and in requiring an answer. In the end, they got the answers. I was very proud to be on the delegation with them. It was probably more difficult for them than for the rest of us. They were a real asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade people that we had with us were, as usual, very good. I know that I say this every time, but it is true. I believe that we have one of the best departments of foreign affairs in the world. It is under-resourced. We do not give it enough credit for exactly how well it does, which is very well. It is excellent and deserves more of everything. The officers who were on the delegation with us were very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish by saying that Vietnam is changing for the better. But I believe that it will take a long time. As economic changes take place, inevitably other changes will follow. But something that both the Vietnamese and Australians have to look at very closely is how fast those political changes occur. I still recommend to the Vietnamese government that it look very closely at those prisoners of conscience and the amnesties that are coming up on 7 September. It should consider very strongly whether prisoners of conscious should be included en masse in those amnesties. </PARA>

I would like to raise a couple of things that are of some concern to me. Over all, I certainly welcome it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is probably Senator Loosley's last major contribution in the Senate before he leaves for other better, probably more lucrative, climes. As the chairman of the delegation, I congratulate him on this and all the work that he has done in this area during his time in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Loosley and Senator Bourne have said, the delegation was a very good one. I pay particular credit, as they have, to the two members of the Vietnamese-Australian community who were on the delegation. Both Professor Trang Thomas and Ms Ho Mai are well known to me. They are leading members of the Vietnamese-Australian community in Australia, and certainly in my state of Victoria. As Senator Bourne said, without doubt they had the most difficult role of all. They went with a great deal of pressure on them from the Vietnamese community in Australia. There was a great deal of expectation from the community as to how they would perform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure Senator Loosley and Senator Bourne are aware, some concern has been expressed within sections of the Vietnamese community in Australia that the delegation did not achieve all that it would like it to have, particularly in the area of human rights. I was very pleased to hear Senator Bourne point out the firmness with which Trang Thomas and Ho Mai approached their task. That is a very valuable point to have on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley said that this was the first delegation of its kind to Vietnam. I guess that is right when one takes into account the overall composition of the delegation and the fact that it included more than just politicians. I was a member of a small parliamentary delegation to Vietnam in October 1993. We did many of the same things that this delegation did. In some respects, we had some greater success in the human rights area than this one did, although it has obviously had success in other aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that this delegation was prevented from meeting any political or religious prisoners of conscious. The October 1993 delegation, through some considerable persistence on our part&mdash;we probably did not endear ourselves to officialdom there&mdash;managed to have a meeting with one of the leading religious prisoners, the most venerable Thich Quang Do. It was not a terribly satisfactory meeting, but at least it broke some considerable ground. I note the recommendation in the report that it ought to be a high priority of any future delegation to Vietnam that there be the opportunity to meet people such as him. It is very important. If that does not happen, it is not possible to come back and say with as much confidence as one would like that it covered the field to the extent to which it did. I am sure that both senators would agree with that comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also sorry that the delegation appears to have not met with representatives of the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam. There are two Buddhist churches in Vietnam. The Vietnam Buddhist Church is the official government church. There is also the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the members of which have been persecuted and imprisoned over many years now, including Thich Quang Do and many others. It was unfortunate that the delegation was apparently not able, for one reason or another, to meet representatives of the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam whilst they were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am unable to comment on how the delegation went in relation to the meeting with representatives of the Catholic church. Two months ago in Parliament House we had a seminar on Australia-Vietnam relations conducted by the International Committee for a Free Vietnam of which I am one of the three Australian co-presidents, along with my colleagues Philip Ruddock and Ted Grace from the House of Representatives. So both sides of the main political spectrum are represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that seminar, which was held in the Main Committee Room on 24 February, one of the speakers was the chairman of the Vietnamese Catholic community in Sydney, Mr Joachim Nguyen Van Thine. In a submission to that seminar, he spoke of the ongoing restrictions and persecutions in Vietnam in relation to the Catholic church. In particular, he mentioned, and had tabled, lists of priests and seminarians who are still being imprisoned by the Vietnamese government. We might have occasion for further debate on this subject in this place in the future. That is something that I would certainly like to hear take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in Washington I attended an international conference on Vietnam which was convened by the International Committee For a Free Vietnam. It has chapters in the United States, Canada, Australia and in some countries in Europe which we are trying to develop further. We are concerned about doing what we can as an international community to further, by all peaceful means, the democratisation of Vietnam. There is no doubt that whilst there have been important economic reforms and that the policy of doi moi that has been pursued since 1986 really has worked in many economic aspects, I remind the Senate that Vietnam remains one of the poorest nations on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out that before the communists came to power in 1975 in Vietnam as a whole, Vietnam was one of the more affluent nations in the South-East Asian region. The fact is that the communist regime absolutely devastated the Vietnamese economy. It subjected countless millions of its 70 million people to grinding, abject poverty which should never have arisen. It is a fact that there is no way that Vietnam is going to meet its full economic potential, international community potential and the rightful place it should take in the councils of the world unless it moves, in political terms, along the same lines as it is moving economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will never be a full development of the Vietnamese economy whilst Vietnam remains a totalitarian, one-party state. The process of economic reform will inevitably lead to political reform. We have to be very careful that we do all that we possibly can to ensure that that happens rather than see economic reform stalling because of the continuation of a totalitarian political regime. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment adds a new paragraph to proposed section 82ZSB(2). It provides that, if the commissioner refers a complaint to a fund for investigation, and a report to him or her, the agreement between a hospital or practitioner in the fund remains in place until a decision is taken on the investigation report. The purpose of this is that it should obviate the need for affected parties to seek temporary remedies, such as an injunction, pending the outcome of the decision. It would also prevent a patient from being out of pocket because of an investigation. Essentially, it allows the continuation of the status quo until a report from the commission, and that would seem a logical thing to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that. The agency has jumped the gun, I suppose, in that regard. That also poses the interesting question of when it thought the legislation would go through and whether those changes were to be announced saying, `Here we are, we have responded very quickly to the passage of legislation and we have introduced new tables'. Minister, can't you see that, in essence, by allowing that to occur, the community rating principle is destroyed. If some things can be excluded from tables&mdash;I think one in seven Australians in a lifetime can expect to get some serious mental illness requiring care&mdash;you are already chipping away at a community rating principle, if not destroying it because that opens up competition between funds in relation to tables that are provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

Another example I can give is the exclusion of knee replacements. That is one of the very expensive items. </PARA>

The government may well say that the funds can have national registration under the legislation. Most funds do not have it now, but they can have it under the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the minister's attention to the fact that the previous amendment that she proposed, and which was passed, refers to the averaging, and it is referred to in the legislation itself.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of benefit payable in respect of an episode of hospital treatment under subparagraph (i) of the condition set out in paragraph (bf) must equal or exceed the average level of benefit payable by the organisation in respect of an episode of hospital treatment of that kind in the hospitals or day hospital facilities with which the organisation has hospital purchaser-provider agreements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Herron, your proposed amendment sets the default benefit at half the average contract payment for the type of episode in question.

It would require a great deal of data across the full range of cases.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendment achieves the intention of your amendment in a much more flexible way. It allows the minister to set different benefit levels for different patient groups, as well as to take other factors into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has already said that in the emergency situation it will need that data anyway. As to the point that the amendment is complex, I do not see that it is any more complex than the government's proposal. The argument put to me by one of the officers is that there would be outlays at the extreme end of the range. The reality is that the majority of things that occur will be common situations. With the introduction of casemix, I do not see that this measure is any more complex in averaging out than taking 50 per cent of a fund's average for a particular type of episode. The complexity of the measure is not a strong argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, you then used the argument that the figure of 50 per cent would be well above the basic table. That is something that will need to be checked but my information is that at the very most it might be 7 per cent above what is being proposed in the legislation. We do not know that for sure because we do not have the data, although the government must have some idea of what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have previously accepted averaging in relation to emergencies. It may be that getting that data might impose a somewhat greater cost on insurance but that is balanced by the benefit level being set by the market place rather than by determination of government. Surely that is in the best interests of the patients. The points you have made about complexity, the fact that the benefit might be well above the basic table and that you do not accept averaging are negated by the points I have made in moving this amendment. </PARA>

The information provided to me says that benefits will be well above the basic table.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This illustrates my point that the government is concerned that it will not encourage coverage through the proposals in this legislation. The level imposed is being arbitrarily set by government rather than being determined by the market place. The minister has already accepted that averaging occurs in emergency situations. I cannot see why the government does not let it occur in non-emergency situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has already stated that the government has had to revisit what constitutes an emergency. She might be leaving the door wide open for the applicability of this legislation to a default benefit lower than 50 per cent of the average. That in turn would mitigate against people taking up private health insurance because, using her argument, the refunds could be lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the whole purpose of this exercise is to kick people out of private health insurance. I have heard nothing that would attract people to taking private health insurance. The minister is saying that the government will not average the default level of benefit to 50 per cent of the fund average for type of episode; it will make it lower by decree. The budget has given us an increase in the Medicare tax. People with private health insurance will pay five times for their health care: through the Medicare tax, through general taxation, through state tax, through private health insurance and then through out-off-pocket expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By not accepting our amendment, the minister is saying that, in a situation requiring a default level of benefit, these people will get a lower refund than that which the market determines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably not, Senator, since you start off by being absolutely clear that you know what this legislation is for&mdash;to drive people out of private health insurance. I am perfectly prepared to hear you say that you do not think that this bill will encourage people, but you do not stop there. You are saying that this government is determined to drive people out of private health insurance. Your attitude means that we cannot expect to come to an agreement. You are determined to know something contrary to what the government is saying. I will certainly give you an explanation but it is not assisted by that clear statement of your attitude to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only reiterate the points I have already made. The other point that needs to be made is that it is the intention of this legislation that there be contracts. We do not expect that all hospitals will be allowed to come and go, cheerfully accepting your definition of market forces applying to the basic target. The idea of a 50 per cent averaging out being defined as letting the market run its course is straining the definition of letting the market run its course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite clear that we want that flexibility in setting the different benefit levels. We want that flexibility as much as possible to keep the cost down because that will keep the cost against the funds down&mdash;that is, the claims against the funds&mdash;and it will certainly encourage people not just to take the basic cover, to risk it, but to take the more comprehensive cover that happens under contracts. So, Senator, there is nothing further that can be said.

<PARA>On the other hand, if that is the reason for the legislation&mdash;and we can but believe the minister's own words&mdash;by not accepting this amendment, you are also going to reduce the refund to the patients.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no requirement for outpatient care in item No. 46. I know that Senator Lees said in debate that it would enable that. It specifically refers to all kinds of hospital treatment. There is certainly an overlap, particularly in these three areas. There is an overlap with regard to other situations as well. As I understand it, it is unlikely to be offered within tables developed by private health insurance organisations. Those three areas are not ones that any of us can predict we are likely to need, so they can be excluded from tables. As I mentioned previously, it chips away at the community rating principle in so far as, by excluding items such as these from benefits tables, insurance companies can certainly compete with each other. That was the purport of the statement by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to the insurance organisations, when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It very much depends on the extent to which now that they don't have to be price takers, the funds can genuinely negotiate a better deal, because we have seen a rapid escalation in the cost of private health care and premiums and out-of-pocket costs way out of line with input cost increases and I think any reasonable assessment would reach the conclusion there is room for the funds to get a better deal for their holders.</PARA>
<PARA>As Dr Duckett said before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, if they do get a better deal for their shareholders, then that better deal can either go to reducing premiums or to reserves. It can go to wherever they like; it will not necessarily lower premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment ensures that where there is an overlap in this regard between, on the one hand, hospital care and, on the other hand, completely outpatient care provided by medical practitioners, obviously there will be no contract, as I see it. If it is totally outpatient, then there is no provision in amendment No. 46 moved by the government and the Democrats for that situation. It may well be that there is an opportunity for hospitals to have an outreach situation. Certainly, it gets very complex when you get into that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, specific Commonwealth grants are given to hospitals to provide, for example, post-acute care in the home situation so that patients can be discharged earlier from an acute hospital and looked after in their homes. But they are specific grants that on the one hand may be part of Commonwealth-state agreements but on the other hand may be directly from the state governments to specific hospitals. I instanced in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee a particular patient who was unable to get domiciliary care. Because she had come from a private hospital, gone back to her home and had not come from a public hospital, the nursing association that provided the domiciliary care had no funding from the private hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for an amendment such as this to allow for outpatient coverage not specifically related only to hospital treatment. That is but another example of the same thing. It may be in relation to psychiatric care, rehabilitation care, palliative care or even acute or post-acute care as an outpatient. It does not seem that these particular matters are covered in either the original legislation or amendment No. 46. If I am correct in that assessment, and I believe that I am, I ask the minister: how does a patient get covered for care outside the hospital as an outpatient?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke about this matter last time we discussed this bill five or six weeks ago. I have done a considerable amount of work on it in the intervening five weeks. I am assured by the various parties concerned that, if it is a medical decision that people are better cared for in their homes, the funds will do everything they possibly can to facilitate the hospitals and support them through that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state, one of the funds is looking at the moment at working with a home nursing service&mdash;the biggest one in South Australia; it has been running for six years&mdash;and is starting to set up processes. It will get from the home nursing service its recent data on who it has been caring for. I have looked through some of the de-identified data which shows they are indeed caring for people who are very seriously ill, such as people needing intravenous drips and people with burns that have not healed properly and which need high intensity dressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds are looking at helping the hospitals access these services by providing the hospitals with greater information, as we move to casemix, on what is available. In my home state there has been some reservation in the public sector to move into this because of the geographic nature of some of the trials in other states that have not worked. We need to be looking at a far greater area covered by these nursing services. The one in Adelaide covers the entire city. It has now worked successfully, as I said, for six years, with many nurses being employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron mentioned competition. The funds want this for that reason alone, as well as wanting to work in the best interests of their patients. They get a negative reaction from people who are insured through them if those people learn later on that they could have been treated at home instead of being stuck in hospital. So they want this because they want to give the patients what they want and also for competitive reasons, because treatment at home is obviously a lot cheaper. With regard to this nursing service, if they only need to make one visit a day it is a matter of $60 or $70 at the most, depending on the level of nursing, compared to hundreds of dollars in a hospital bed. They have assured me for both those reasons that they will be working with the hospitals through the options available as they move to casemix payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their reason for not wanting a separate payment to go to nurses directly from the funds is that you will end up still with your six days in hospital and nursing, rather than looking at what the actual episode of care needs to be and the doctor making the decision, `Okay, that person can go out after four days but then will need another four days in the home.' So it is a matter of basically going back to the medical practitioner to make the decision in line with the hospital. Then, whatever mix of service is considered desirable will be funded through the casemix payment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the statements from Senator Lees. We did have that objection, particularly in Adelaide, because I think it is the only city that has one dominant group of nurses providing domiciliary care. But at present the major incentive for people to get out of private hospitals is the cost. I can assure you that there is no difficulty in discharging patients from a private hospital. They want to get out of the place as fast as they can. Provided they are not so ill that they need to be there for their own benefit, and they can be persuaded on occasion to stay in a hospital, it does become a medical judgment and it is of necessity a medical judgment.

It is something the hospital is going to have to discuss with the doctor and the fund. If the hospital has the payment on the DRG basis for that episode&mdash;and maybe it is a five-day episode&mdash;surely it would be a very strange hospital that pocketed the money. That is in spite of the fact that the hospital did not want the patient to go home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that that is a rare and uncommon occurrence. I am not introducing this just to throw up a theoretical example. However, there is no requirement in this legislation for outpatient coverage to occur. It certainly would be desirable that that whole episode was covered under casemix funding and that the care in that particular instance would be covered by arrangements made with the health insurance association entity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us can predict what will occur to us in relation to health matters. My amendment covers the outpatient situation specifically and not, of necessity, as part of the inpatient acute care. I suppose we have to know what goes on in the market. Not uncommonly it is the public hospitals that have the problem, particularly under the current government, with waiting lists increasing and people dropping out of private health insurance. I take it the minister is trying to keep people in private health insurance to take pressure off the Medicare system in relation to public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the public hospitals that discharge people often prior to their medical requirements. It is not uncommon for the medical superintendent of a hospital to go around the hospital and say, `We need 10 beds. We have 20 admissions coming in. Turf people out'. That is very common. It is one of the major problems for public hospitals. It is a matter of trying to find beds for patients coming into hospital the next day because of operations that have been booked perhaps six months ahead&mdash;in fact, it is two years ahead in relation to knee replacements and three years ahead for tonsillectomies at Royal Brisbane Hospital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war the dramatic and unexpected comments of the former US Secretary of State, Robert McNamara, have inevitably taken centre stage, inflaming once again the deep-seated arguments for and against Australia's involvement in that war. In doing so, those headlines have tended to set aside our first duty as a nation and as individuals at this time, whatever our view may be or may have been of that conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first obligation on the occasion of an anniversary of a war is to pay tribute&mdash;just tribute&mdash;to all the men and women who served in our defence forces in that war. The quality and dedication of their service are not to be measured by the success or failure of a particular conflict, or by the final judgment by history, or otherwise, of the cause. We do not fail to pay tribute to the Anzacs at Gallipoli or to the 2nd AIF in their involvement in Greece in World War II. Indeed, for those comparatively distant battles, the length of the telescope of historic judgment may not yet be long enough. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our democracy our servicemen and servicewomen obey the decisions of their elected governments. Our regular defence forces are there to respond to any call upon them, as they do today in many conflicts, controversial or otherwise, well planned or grossly mismanaged, which encircle the world&mdash;Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Somalia, to name a few. Whether they are conscripts or volunteers, that same commitment has always been made. In New Guinea, as in Vietnam, Australians worked and fought together in no way differentiated in their commitment and in their valour by the method of their recruitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, in the Vietnam conflict all those whose names came out in the so-called `birthday lottery' were given the choice of going to Vietnam or serving part-time in the then forces for five years&mdash;a form of conscience release. All Vietnam commanders have acknowledged the unity of purpose of both the regular soldiers and the conscripts. All have paid tribute, without distinction, to the fighting qualities of both. Indeed, there was abundant evidence that, working alongside the South Vietnamese people and learning from them of their cause, the great majority of our Australians on the ground believed in the justice of that cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, it is our duty and, indeed, it should be our pride as a parliament and a people to express to everyone who served in Vietnam our great indebtedness and our deep sadness at the sacrifice in suffering and death paid&mdash;and still being paid today&mdash;by them. They did their duty in both spirit and quality of commitment. No-one can ask for more. They stand today in full equal merit alongside those who fought in two world wars, in Korea and in Malaysia. Let no-one denigrate their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Vietnam war was a particularly ugly and dirty conflict by the nature of the jungle, the booby traps, the guerrilla type fighting and the difficulty&mdash;often inability&mdash;to distinguish friend from foe is true. And true it is that innocent civilians&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;were caught up in the slaughter; sometimes, however inadvertently, in our own fields of fire. But all wars are ugly and dirty no matter how hard we may try to sanitise them by international conventions on human behaviour. We must not detract from our tribute to our defence forces by wrongly condemning them for the unavoidable ugliness, accidents and tragedies of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one who was not in Australia in those years and who was not caught up in the debates and the emotions of that time, may I make some comments on the broader issues&mdash;not in an attempt to be judgmental, but to raise matters for some future reflection? Firstly, many Australians and others were led to believe that the Vietnam conflict was simply a civil war within one nation of people, and therefore one which did not merit external influence or have any external consequences as to its outcome. But, as I read history, North and South Vietnam were never, in the past 2,000 years or so, essentially one country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the textbooks tell us that North Vietnam for a thousand years was a province of southern China, absorbing the culture and the religious characteristics of that country. As far as I am aware, the only times North Vietnam and South Vietnam were joined together were for short periods by the force of arms of the French and the Japanese. The history books are full of attempts by the north to invade the south in order to get to the richer river deltas. Vietnam, sometimes described as a necklace of pearls, has its richer treasures, like pearls, below. From recollection, the south in past centuries had built a wall across its centre to resist invaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The textbooks tell us also that the south had developed over the years a distinctive culture and religion of its own, influenced by Indians and by other travellers. I have read, for example, that the south had adopted Small Wheel Buddhism, as distinct from the north. Again, I read that after the rout of the French by the Viet Minh in 1954 and the international attempts to settle the conflict&mdash;the Geneva Accords&mdash;a dividing line was drawn. Subsequently, the media tells us that more than one million people fled from the north to the south&mdash;a modern day Rwanda. Today, in searching our consciences as we do in relation to Rwanda, we ask the same question: are we our brothers' keepers or are we simply an international grouping feeding and medicating those who are to die while we watch?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is so complex today and so far from clear cut, why have the revisionists painted the issue of Vietnam as so black-and-white? What parallel today is there to the request by Cambodia for the supply of Australian military trainees?  How will history judge the role, the intentions and the horizons of Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the north? Was he simply and wholly a fervent patriot of his country or were his motives more influenced by the extensive and lengthy training and commitment to international communism in Peking?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, with the USSR, the Warsaw Pact and the Cold War no longer a serious world threat, and with Russia's military expenditure and exploitations limited by the economic collapse in that country, it is very difficult to realise the measure or the reality of the domino theory which, if honourable senators remember, predicated a steady downward march of international communism into the Pacific and through Vietnam to Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty years ago there was abundant evidence of Russia's desire to increase its military presence in the Pacific&mdash;a desire greatly frustrated by the fact that its eastern naval base, Vladivostok, locked into the Sea of Japan, was icebound for the major part of the year. In that context, how attractive was the warm water port of Haiphong in North Vietnam? Certainly the Russians were quick to use that port after the end of the war. Only history will judge the full extent of Russia's intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What, too, of Chinese communism? What of the PKI and Indonesia? What would have been the consequences to us here if the PKI's attempted coup in 1965 had succeeded and all Indonesia had come under international communist control? What effects would communist rule in Irian Jaya have had on the stability of Papua New Guinea? What a slender thread determined the success or failure of that coup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General Nasution, Suharto's fellow general in the 1965 uprising, when asked why the non-communists had stood against apparently overwhelming odds, is reported as saying that he and his colleagues assessed that the one chance they had of resisting international communism was while America was maintaining a shield against communism in Vietnam. A fortunate decision indeed for Papua New Guinea and for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government of the early 1960s had been warned of the danger of a successful PKI coup. Indeed, I believe it was a major influence in the decision to order the then state-of-the-art F111s&mdash;the only aircraft with the range and quality capable of long-range interdiction. Again, does the PKI coup support the domino theory? Only history will judge. Was Vietnam from the outset an unwinnable war or was it eminently winnable but lost by the restrictive and unimaginative decisions of its politicians and its generals? If the war had been won, would the slaughter of more than one million Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge have occurred? Again, history must judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not competent for any Australian service man or woman to have such foresight or final judgement. Decisions are made on the events of the day. For our defence forces there was simply a commitment to be discharged. The massive effort and the sacrifice of the South Vietnamese troops in defence of their freedom must not be forgotten. Their sacrifices were immense and the wounds and divisions with the north have not be settled fully to this day. The boat people themselves are a message to history in themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The neglect of the returning Australian servicemen from Vietnam and the utterly wrong association of them with the justice or otherwise of the war created a psychology of guilt which in many ways has caused more suffering and more casualties than the war itself. This anniversary gives us all, in a totally bipartisan way, the opportunity to draw the line on the argument for the moment and to make a unanimous judgement on the quality and dedication of every Australian who served in Vietnam. That judgment is very clear. They deserve, one and all, our praise and our gratitude for their commitment and our pride in the quality of their service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech I wish to give tonight is rather too long to give in 10 minutes and it may have to be given in episodes. I want to raise a number of issues in relation to the conduct of CSL over a number of years and the failure of its manufacturing process to guarantee safety of its products to the Australian community. Ultimately, a parliamentary inquiry of some sort is required to ascertain exactly what has been going on and the risks to which the Australian public has been exposed. Moreover, I believe that, when CSL was sold, a lot of information was kept from the public and possibly from ministers and also was certainly not disclosed to potential shareholders through the prospectus which CSL published.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the question is: is the public interest adequately served by CSL Ltd as manufacturers of biological products such as blood products, growth hormones and vaccines and by the federal health department as the chief regulator of CSL? I believe the answer is no and that this question demands an open and very full inquiry. I believe the parliament has been misled on a number of occasions concerning the manufacture of these biological products and has been denied information it needs to keep a watch on this activity. It is also very likely indeed that government ministers have been kept deliberately in the dark, including during the debate over the sale of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of their value to individuals and to public health, products of biological origin are supplied to millions of Australians annually under Commonwealth community service obligations. They are quintessentially public interest services, because human blood plasma fractions are used by millions of Australians. Blood is indeed a very scarce national resource. For instance, there are only 144 million litres of human blood available from the whole human population of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blood is supplied to the Red Cross by unpaid donors. In a democracy, public trust in the delivery of and the regulatory systems for the surveillance of the quality of biological products must be extremely well founded. Biological products must be of the highest possible quality. They must be affordable and available when needed. But when mistakes are made&mdash;and, as I will indicate later on, considerable mistakes have been made&mdash;government and manufacturers must take full responsibility for these mistakes. Government and manufacturers must be open, accountable and subject to regulatory scrutiny and scrutiny by the parliament. The commercial-in-confidence provisions which apply to some information provided by pharmaceutical companies&mdash;that is, private pharmaceutical companies&mdash;cannot be applied in the same way to the products of biological origin supplied free to the government in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blood is not a standard material. Every sample from every donor is different. This has enormous ramifications when donations are pooled to make blood products. The use of blood and blood products, therefore, carries some risk. There is no completely foolproof laboratory test or screen for disease. There can be no absolute guarantee that virus-inactivating techniques will always work. There are diseases which cannot be detected in blood. The Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, for instance, is one such known disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is axiomatic, therefore, that there must be other unknown and yet to be discovered diseases. The point at which the blood donor goes into the blood bank to give blood is an important point. Those who give blood should be carefully scrutinised as to their general health, the presence of any diseases and, as far as possible, the quality of the products which go in and are then pooled. Blood products should be protected at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons it is fundamentally important that blood banking material at the point of donation must always be of the highest possible quality. The way to achieve this is to harvest blood from regular donors who are themselves tested and carefully questioned concerning their state of health. The lack of familiarity with these facts has made it difficult for the media and the public to sort out fact from fiction during recent discussions following disclosures last year about dangers associated with the use of human growth hormones, blood products, and the fate of CSL's anti-venom production which was cast off shortly following the sale of that company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a brief sample of the events, practices, omissions, specific allegations and unanswered questions which have arisen recently and which raise extremely serious doubts that the public interest has been and is not being adequately served by CSL, CSL Ltd and the health department as its regulator for biological products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL and the health department have resorted to secrecy and cover-up to avoid accountability for past practices and the limits of its virus inactivation techniques. The practice of CSL and the health department when faced with information which could bring public criticism upon them and incur liabilities for past product failures is too often to withhold important information from the public and those who have been exposed to risk. There are many examples of this secrecy and I wish to offer only a few in this brief delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within an hour of CSL and the health minister's office being informed of the imminent publication of last year's major independent report criticising CSL, the department and the minister for their part in failing to regulate blood products, a whispering campaign of lies about the author of that report had been seeded in Parliament House and in the financial sector. This had the effect of casting doubt on the integrity of her motives for publishing the findings of her five-year study. The source and motive for this whispering campaign of lies should be uncovered. The assertion&mdash;and I make this point very strongly&mdash;behind these rumours had no basis whatsoever in truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Allars reports that the terms of reference for her inquiry did not allow her to examine CSL's product liability and the information in CSL's material therefore could not be properly assessed. Further, the Allars report, which triggers many unanswered questions about the role and liability of CSL over hormone products, was scheduled to be tabled in parliament on the day of the sale of CSL&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Alert</EMPHASIS> document to which I referred a moment ago. Yet it is CSL as manufacturer which bears ultimate responsibility for the products and the harm which they cause. Does this suggest complicity on the part of government or, indeed, a cover-up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could the following facts, known to government and provable, along with others, in an inquiry setting, have influenced its decision to leave CSL out of the picture? For example, during the period of manufacture of human pituitary hormones, CSL did not subscribe to the code of good management practice, as with all of its products. CSL did not submit a manufacturing protocol or product standard to the health authorities for human pituitary gonadotrophin and human growth hormones. CSL did not carry out an assay of its follicle stimulating hormone or its luteinising hormone ratio. The failure to do this was blamed for the excessive number of multiple births, including nonuplets&mdash;that is, nine children being conceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL claimed to determine the follicle simulating hormone potency but did not have an authenticated standard substance for the assay and so did not carry out one valid assay. CSL distributed hormones that were subpotent in their specification. There was no proper selection or screening of glands; pituitary glands were received from overseas and unknown sources and pooled with glands from known sources. A microbiologist was not part of the team manufacturing the hormones, as required under the good manufacturing practice code. This led to a number of unsterile and pyrogenic batches, many of which were distributed. CSL distributed hormones that were known to be contaminated with the hepatitis B virus. I will continue my remarks at a later time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister might wait as I think he might learn something. I have spoken on previous occasions about the importance of the Senate and its position as the only forum for true debate on and scrutiny of legislation. Some may allege that this can be taken a bit far. I could give no better example of what is occurring in relation to the health legislation at the moment. The government introduced 54 amendments and the opposition 42, when obviously that should have gone to one of the standing committees. Instead we are doing it through the Committee of the Whole House. That notwithstanding, the committee of the whole has a very legitimate place in the overall procedure of the Senate, as do the other committees, the Selection of Bills Committee, for example, and the select committees that I have referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the importance of the Senate&mdash;and there is no question about the major role it plays in relation to the Australian constitution&mdash;equally, it is important that we consider the quality of the senators who are here. Specifically, I refer to the Liberal senators from Tasmania who are up for pre-selection at the next pre-selection procedure. The three that I refer to include Senator Jocelyn Newman, the shadow minister for defence. She is a member of the shadow cabinet and is the most senior woman in the history of the coalition occupying a position within the shadow cabinet. Secondly, I mention Senator Paul Calvert, who is deputy whip and chairman of the waste watch committee. He is the opposition's spokesman in the Senate for Commonwealth-state relations and privatisation. He is also an expert on local government and rural and regional affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I mention Senator John Watson, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. He is our expert on taxation and superannuation matters. In fact, he was part of the lock-up on the budget yesterday, from the opposition's point of view&mdash;a very unusual situation for a senator to be in. It is certainly an acknowledgment of his importance to the party and the weight that we place on him, as does the government on many occasions; it certainly listens to what Senator Watson has to say in relation to these matters. I am proud to say that these three senators are colleagues of inestimable value to the opposition. I look forward to the continuation of their representation of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, they are now being challenged by one Robin Gray. Mr President, I stand before you today as a victim of Robin Gray. Nearly 12 years ago I was president of the Liberal Party in Queensland. If you cast your mind back, Mr President, you will remember that this was before the Fitzgerald inquiry which revealed the corruption that existed in government. The then Premier, Bjelke-Petersen, refused to recognise the leader of the Liberal Party, who had been duly elected by the Liberal Party as its leader. Of course, that then broke the coalition agreement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 30 March 1995, the Spectrum Manager determined an annual fee of $51 for an amateur apparatus licence, which came into force on 3 April 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) On 8 December 1993 the then Minister for Communications, the Honourable David Beddall, MP directed the SMA to hold a public inquiry into the apparatus licence system and to advise him of the outcomes of the review by 31 May 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SMA inquiry included an extensive process of public consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Ministerial Statement to which the Senator refers is the fifth in a series of annual reports to Parliament on Australia's development cooperation program. The purpose of these reports is to inform Parliament of significant developments in the aid program and to provide an analytical discussion of current aid and development policy issues. The statement is not intended to provide a detailed list of each and every aid activity. AusAID's reporting to Parliament on all aid activities, including those of ACIAR, is done through a number of other documents  the DFAT Portfolio annual report; the budget related paper on the development cooperation program; and, in 1995, the program budget statements which now report at all sub-program levels, including ACIAR. I should also point out that ACIAR is, for the purposes of government administration, a statutory authority and as such provides its own annual report to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent policy paper addressed two areas carrying important implications for Australia's development assistance. These are, firstly, the range of social development issues such as population, health and education which have, over the last year, been the subject of concerted international attention at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development in September 1994 and the World Summit for Social Development which took place at Head of Government level in Copenhagen in March 1995. Secondly, the statement focused on new directions in humanitarian relief which built on the findings of a review undertaken early in 1994 in response to the complex humanitarian emergencies in Africa and Europe. That review has led to a new initiative to help address humanitarian needs, the details of which will be announced in the forthcoming budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous Ministerial policy statement, which took as its theme the reduction of poverty, noted the important role of ACIAR and the contribution of international agricultural research to raising production above subsistence, stimulating employment, slowing rural-urban migration, raising incomes and expanding national wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Agriculture is clearly one of those sectors where Australia has internationally competitive goods and services to offer and where our expertise in research is widely recognised. The fact that ACIAR has received real increases in funding in each of the past four budgets and, indeed, has received an increased share of the total aid program, testifies to the importance the Government attaches to agricultural research and the regard in which it holds ACIAR.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government has been concerned for a number of years about the UK Government's policy of not awarding cost-of-living increases to its pensioners in Australia. Many Australian residents formerly lived and worked in the UK and paid contributions to the UK National Insurance Fund. These people can qualify for a British retirement pension and, subject to income and assets tests, also to an Australian age pension. As the real value of British retirement pensions declines over time, British pensioners have had to rely more and more on the Australian age pension to support them during their years of retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It costs the Australian taxpayer about $80m a year in making higher Australian pension payments to British pensioners than would be necessary if the level of UK pensions was maintained through cost-of-living increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UK Government's policy is discriminatory in that it awards cost-of-living increases to its pensioners in some countries such as those in the European Union, USA, Turkey, Barbados and the Philippines, but expects its former dominion countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa to assist UK pensioners in those countries with income support payments. The average UK pension paid in Australia is about $30 a week below the fully indexed level it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There is a social security agreement between Australia and the UK which dates back to 1958. The Agreement gives people, who move permanently between Australia and the United Kingdom, accelerated access to the social security system of the country to which they have moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) At 30 June 1994, the following pensions were paid to UK born residents:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The UK makes no financial contribution towards the cost of the above pensions. The UK pays pensions to about 159,000 people in Australia at a cost of approximately $364m a year. The UK Government estimates that it would pay an additional $231m a year to British pensioners in Australia if it awarded cost-of-living increases to its pensioners here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia pays pensions to about 3,800 pensioners in the UK at a cost of $23.5m a year. The smaller number of pensioners who have returned to the UK reflects the migration pattern between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Australian Government wants to negotiate a social security agreement with the UK under which the two countries would share the responsibility for a person's social security coverage during their retirement years, according to the length of the person's connection to each country's social security scheme. Under such an agreement, rates of pension would be regularly adjusted in line with cost-of-living increases. To date, the UK Government has refused to enter into negotiations on such an agreement with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The reference to the financial drain on the Australian social security system referred to the decisions of the UK Government. The Government appreciates that it is not the fault of UK migrants that their former Government has left them without adequate retirement income by freezing the rate of their pensions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was simply reporting on a UK Government policy which is of major concern and is causing considerable financial outlay to the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) It costs the Australian taxpayer about $80m a year in making higher Australian pension payments to British pensioners than would be necessary if the level of UK pensions was maintained through cost-of-living increases.</PARA>
