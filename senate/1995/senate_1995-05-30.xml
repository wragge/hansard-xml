<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Cook representing the Treasurer. The minister would be aware that the Business Council of Australia's latest survey of its member companies shows that imports are expected to grow from an annual rate of 7.8 per cent in the half year to March to 11.9 per cent in the half year to September. That is a 50 per cent increase in the import growth rate. It is more than three times the forecast rate of GDP growth in the budget papers. I ask the minister: won't this put more downward pressure on the Australian dollar and thus lift prices and wages, and won't you then force up interest rates to control the current account crisis in exactly the same way as you did before the recession we had to have?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has to be kept in mind is that this is a survey of business expectations; it is not a report on business performance. Indeed, when we look at the forecasts of activity in the budget, we see that the projected growth in the Australian economy is 3 3/4per cent; we see that unemployment is falling; we see that the interest rate, and particularly the underlying rate of interest, is low, and consistently low, in relation to our major trading partners; that the budget itself&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our inflation rate is competitive with and below that of our major trading partners. If you want me to do a survey of our major trading partners to establish that point I will do so. But the other factors of the economy are that the budget is in surplus; we are growing a pool of national savings, and that puts downward pressure on interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that Senator Hill should raise the question of interest rates because the reaction in the market after the budget came down was for interest rates to fall. That is a positive response to the budget. It reflects as well the fall in unemployment and the growth in employment in Australia. All of those things come together to indicate a strong business investment climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other elements of our forecast is continuing high investment particularly in capital goods for major companies in Australia. Often that means, with regard to goods that cannot be made here or for which there is no manufacturer here, importation of those goods from overseas and, therefore, a higher level of imports. But the important thing to remember about those goods that are capital goods that are imported is that they add to the industrial capacity of the economy. They create an ability for the economy to increase its productivity, to compete across a range of other areas, and  they create a favourable climate for the competitiveness index in Australia to rise. In other words, they strengthen our economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are, when you quote them, a big import bill. Indeed, on the current account figures we saw yesterday, there is still some growth in capital imports. Although, interestingly, on the current account figures from yesterday, there is a greater increase in exports than there is in imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate what the Business Council says in its forecasts. However, the situation for the Australian economy is one of still solid growth, of greater growth than that of most other countries in the OECD. And the fundamentals of the economy do indicate the continuance of a sustainable level of good growth that maintains Australia at the top level of the OECD and continues to improve the business climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will, in fact, comment on this because we have been at a very high level of growth in the last year or so and, coming off a very high level of growth, the growth prospects are a little less than they were the year before. Some interpreters will say that is a reflection on the economy but, indeed, the levels of growth we are talking about are sustainable and the underlying factors are strong. Therefore, we can look forward to, we believe as a government, good business conditions and a continuance of employment growth, economic growth and low inflation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I am not sure whether it is complacency or the minister simply does not understand the issue, so we will take him through it again slowly. The government anticipates a current account deficit of $27 billion next year&mdash;the same as this last year&mdash;and now the Business Council is forecasting, with all its expertise and experience, that we will be in fact sucking in the imports in the second half of this year at a much greater rate than what the government believes. What effect will that have on the current account? It means the crisis can only worsen. Does that not mean that you will do exactly what you did before the last recession, and that is, in an effort to dampen demand, push up interest rates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this is a question that asks me to comment on interest rates, I am not going to do that. But I might say that there is no reason why the government should change its forecasts for this economy. The economy is of good, strong solid growth, continuing low inflation, high employment growth, a high profit share and, in surplus, the growing of a national pool of savings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Given the decision by federal cabinet last night to extend exceptional circumstances drought assistance to areas of Victoria for the first time and to additional areas of New South Wales, can the minister advise how many farm families are now in receipt of this vital assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the Senate that federal cabinet last night endorsed a package of further assistance for farming families who are caught in exceptional drought conditions. The additional support will cost up to $40.3 million. This takes the Commonwealth government's commitment to drought assistance now to in excess of $560 million. The National Farmers Federation, in welcoming this package today, said, `No-one can doubt the Commonwealth government's commitment to drought assistance.' Before last night's decision, 10,500 families were accessing this vital assistance&mdash;that is families, not individuals. In fact, over 30,000 rural people are now receiving this assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just answered that question, if you had listened. The decision extends assistance now to an additional 4,000 farm households in New South Wales and Victoria. This will take the total number of farm households receiving or expected to receive drought relief payments to nearly 15,000 in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. In addition to the drought relief payment, the exceptional circumstances package includes interest rate subsidies on up to 100 per cent of the outstanding debt, basic family payment, health care cards and Austudy eligibility. Cabinet also agreed to provide an additional $480,000 to enhance rural counselling services in Victoria and New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's assistance has been provided through the drought exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme. In addition to the sum of money I have just mentioned, the federal government will be providing $256 million over the next four years through the rural adjustment scheme to primary producers. The provision of investment allowances for drought proofing&mdash;that is, for water and fodder subsidies&mdash;and for the significant enhancement, with very generous tax incentives for farmers, in the farm management bond scheme have already been announced as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, as you would expect, last night's decision has been welcomed in some quarters and criticised in others. That is perfectly natural when you consider the nature of the scheme and the judgments that have to be made. There has been considerable debate about the transparency of the criteria to deal with the scheme. I want to advise the Senate that there is a high degree of transparency between the Commonwealth and the state governments on this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government accepts&mdash;and I have made this point before&mdash;that we need to continue, and we will continue, in consultation with the states to continually refine the scheme in terms of that criteria. I make the point that we established this scheme halfway through what is without question now the worst drought in living memory in Australia. Had we waited&mdash;as some wanted us to, let me tell you&mdash;to dot the i's, cross the t's and refine it down to the nth degree, we would possibly be now considering making our first drought relief payments. I consider that would be iniquitous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say, as a result of taking that decision and delivering the scheme immediately&mdash;despite the fact that there are huge disparities in how drought relief is conducted across the states in Australia, and still is, and we are continuing to work to bring that together&mdash;10,500 farm families have been receiving this assistance now for a considerable period of time. The decision taken last night will increase that by 4,000 additional families who live in the worst hit areas of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to yesterday's report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that he ignored written advice by the Director-General of ASIS that a group of aggrieved former ASIS agents were about to go public and that in order to protect national security it was necessary to hold an inquiry into their complaints. Why did the minister place Australia's security interests in jeopardy by failing to heed the warning of the Director-General? Is it not a fact that had the minister acted in accordance with the advice he received from the Director-General there would have been no public disclosure by the aggrieved officers, no breach of ASIS security and a fair hearing for the officers concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already answered that question at the time of the release of the ASIS initial public report, both in a press conference in response to detailed questioning and also, I think, in a TV program that night. The truth of the matter is that, although there was a suggestion that came to me just a few days before the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report on the ABC that maybe it was time to consider the public inquiry being initiated, we had discussed the possibility of that on and off over the previous six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I did receive such a report from the Director-General, I had not, in fact, acted on it&mdash;yes, that is perfectly true&mdash;at the time that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program went to air. It was under consideration by me, and I was prepared, in fact, to more or less go down that particular path. None of us had any anticipation at that stage that the whole thing would blow publicly in the way that it did at the time that it did. Certainly the Director-General did not indicate that there was any immediate urgency in the sense of some deadline attached to the consideration of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the benefit of hindsight, it may well have been the case that, if we had initiated the report a few days earlier, it might have served the desired purpose. Yes, that is perfectly possible. It was the case, as I have already frankly publicly acknowledged, that the actual decision to initiate the full-scale royal commission inquiry was made finally as a direct response to the extreme and outrageous disclosures, or purported disclosures, that were made at the time of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these things one does have the benefit of hindsight. My judgment at the time was that the grievances that the particular officers were expressing had been the subject of an extraordinarily extensive process through all the mechanisms that had been established for their consideration with the consent and enthusiasm, in fact, of this parliament&mdash;in particular, the mechanism of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There had been an internal grievance process. That had run its course. That had then been supplemented by an extremely extended further grievance process culminating in what were essentially favourable reports&mdash;in some significant respects anyway&mdash;in so far as the complainants were concerned. It was a matter for judgment, which I repeated at the time, that I thought their grievances had been justly attended to. It proved not to be, and after another 40 days of inquiry and hearing there were some marginal additional justifications for possible compensation or redress that were identified by the commissioners. That is not surprising when a further process of that extended kind is entered into.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apology for the judgments that I made at the time. They were fine, balanced judgments; they always are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope it is not being suggested by you, as it seemed to be by your shadow minister, Alexander Downer, that simply because a threat is made about disclosure of something that is preferably not disclosed, governments should rush and leap to attention with royal commissions and all the various expensive paraphernalia that go with them. Were such to be the case, we would be hostage to fortune over and over again. Government is always a matter of making fine judgments of this kind. I made the judgment I did at the time on the balance of all available evidence. I certainly had not rejected the recommendation at all of the Director-General. It was still the subject of discussion at the time that events overtook it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, he did not write to me in stark terms; it was suggesting a course of action on balance. Secondly, I cannot recall any other occasion on which he similarly urged an inquiry upon me. That is not something directors-general of intelligence and security are usually very often minded to do. I do reject the suggestion that I acted in any way which is misleading in what I have just said, because I had not rejected the possibility of an inquiry addressing questions of accountability and management of ASIS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did think that an inquiry into revisiting all the particular circumstances of the individual grievances, in fact rehearing the grievances as a grievance procedure, was unnecessary. In fact, the commissioners of inquiry did not go down that particular path. They treated the grievances as examples of the kind of thing that was involved in ASIS administration and what accordingly might be necessary by way of a revised grievance or redress procedure. In the course of making those policy judgements they did revisit a number of aspects of the grievance and made some recommendations accordingly. That was not within their terms of reference, however.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do know the opposition is a policy free zone. Because it does not have any policies, it is worth while comparing its record with the record of our government. We have had strong, sustainable growth in the Australian economy. We have had growth for the past 14 consecutive quarters. That is three and a half years of economic growth. The economy grew by five per cent through the year to the December quarter 1994. This makes us the second strongest growing economy among the 15 major OECD economies, and that is according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine on 26 May. Growth is expected to be very strong in the 1994-95 year, growth to be 4.75 per cent. The budget forecast, as a said earlier, is 3 3/4per cent for this budget year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does that compare? The average rate of economic growth under Mr Howard when he was Treasurer was 2.6 per cent. Under us the average growth rate has been 3.3 per cent. Looking at the quality of that growth in terms of the level of inflation, the growth of employment, the level of interest rates and the level of taxation, some other comparisons can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average rate of inflation when Mr Howard was Treasurer was 9.7 per cent. When he left office it was 11.4 per cent. The average rate of inflation under Labor is 5.5 per cent compared with the 9.7 per cent of the Liberals, and only 1.9 per cent on average since June 1991. The current underlying rate of inflation is 1.9 per cent, which compares with the underlying rate of inflation when Mr Howard left office of 10.5 per cent. I remind the Senate that the budget forecasts the underlying inflation rate to be maintained at around two or three per cent over the course of the economic cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the measure of employment. Employment has grown by 5.1 per cent through the year to April 1995. That is around 640,000 new jobs created since February 1993. Furthermore, the budget sees continuing strong employment growth of three per cent in 1995-96. The Howard record certainly will not be repeated by this government. The average number of jobs created per year under Howard was 51,300 compared with the average number of jobs created under us of 163,540. I repeat those figures: 51,300 under Howard; 163,540 under us. That is the average rate of employment growth by comparison. Unemployment when Mr Howard left office was 10 per cent. The current rate of unemployment is 8.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On the issue of taxation, government revenue as a share of GDP was 26 per cent under Howard compared with 24.1 per cent under this government. That is to say, the tax burden under us is much lower than it was under the coalition when it was in power. It means that there would have been an extra $9 billion of government revenue collected in taxes and charges if Mr Howard was in office and had continued his level of taxation. In other words, the Labor government has saved Australia $9 billion worth of taxation, given the tax rates that applied under the coalition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Can the Minister inform the Senate of how proposed changes to the child-care assistance scheme will assist workers with family responsibilities and families with a parent at home with a small child?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="516" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to answer this question because it goes to one of the significant initiatives in the recent budget. Since this government came to office it has made it quite clear what the status of child care is. Child care has been elevated to an issue central to our major economic programs. It is no longer a welfare issue. What is more, with its increase in child care, this government has increased the opportunities for women to participate in the labour force and, at the same time, we have recognised the needs of women who are at home through our occasional care program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families have told us that they want affordable, flexible and responsible child care that caters for the changing nature of work. It needs to be particularly flexible enough for part-time and casual work. It also reinforces respite and other needs for parents at home or those where one or other parent is no longer in the paid work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major change to child-care assistance in the budget changes eligibility for families with one or both parents at home to 12 hours of subsidised care a week. That is equal to about two or three preschool sessions and equal to the current median usage by parents who are at home with young children. Importantly, this budget initiative will come into place by next April. It will provide a much more equitable spread of occasional care for families with a parent at home. It will free up places to meet further demand for occasional care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We anticipate that 31,000 extra families will be able to be assisted in this way. It builds very much on our emphasis on reinforcing and reminding the child-care industry that the priority of child care is to assist families where both parents or the one parent are in the work force. At the same time, we want to recognise and achieve a balance for occasional care. We do not want, as has happened in some areas, a very significant amount of the child-care assistance and usage to be going to families with no work relationship. So it is important that this balance between the requirements for work related care and the requirements for occasional care be restored. If a few families are using occasional care for very long hours, that denies many other families the opportunity to have some respite and assistance for their occasional care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we can say about this government is that its commitment to child care is absolutely clear. Its commitment to continuing growth in child care is written in the budget. Ongoing expenditure for child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate help keep child care affordable for most families. But there is a big concern about what on earth the opposition would offer in the child-care policy area. The opposition in this area, like every other area, has a policy&mdash;</PARA>

Technology Australia is an initiative of the Industrial Research and Development Board. It has some 100 exhibits from 75 different companies and represents between 10 and five per cent of all grants or approvals that the IR&amp;D Board has given.

One exhibit which is probably worthwhile commending to the opposition is the artificial neurone network.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and it is actually not difficult at all to reconcile the two points, for reasons which I will come to in a moment. Let me clarify, firstly, this absolute fantasy that somehow or other the decision will affect the price of CDs by, it is now said, $9. It was alleged for some time that it might have been $4. Figures which I have seen most recently from the Minister for Communications and the Arts suggest that the difference between the wholesale price for CDs in Australia and the United States is less than $1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that it is impossible for the parallel importation of CDs to affect the margins of retailers&mdash;it only operates at the wholesale level&mdash;it cannot affect the relative price by more than the wholesale price difference which, on the last figures I saw, was less than $1. The other thing to remember is that the statistics, as they were provided most recently, suggest that there is no correlation between countries which have parallel importing and countries which have low-priced CDs: in fact, the evidence is to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point to remember in dealing with trade law and the appropriate trade policies with regard to the parallel importation of CDs is the question of ownership of intellectual property. The major exporting countries of intellectual property&mdash;including Australia&mdash;are very concerned that we have proper laws and regulations that protect the intellectual property of producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to protect that intellectual property and the capacity of the customs service effectively to protect it against piracy, and for the owners of the intellectual property to have the right to protect the circumstances under which their property is sold, that we have pursued the policy we have with regard to parallel imports. I believe it will also have domestic industry policy benefits. That is not an area for my policy concern, but I believe it will. But for the proper protection of the rights of property owners&mdash;in this case intellectual property owners&mdash;to gain reasonable return from their property and to control the circumstances in which their property is sold and distributed, it was a proper policy for.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A drought exceptional circumstances package cannot simply be used as a package to cover all of the risks associated with running a farm in Australia. The amounts of money would be running into billions if it were simply an underwriting scheme that did that. Rather than talk about generalities, I will detail the particularity of the concerns about the criteria in those two areas&mdash;first, extending the criteria to take account of a whole range of other problems that have, without question, reduced farmers' incomes and, second, not using rainfall as the threshold criteria for determining whether or not there is an exceptional drought. I will not change my position on those issues, and neither should I responsibly. One thing I would point out to Senator Brownhill&mdash;and I did a calculation on this last night&mdash;is that, in respect of the opposition's only policy published on drought relief by the shadow minister John Anderson and which has not been changed since, there would be only 13 rural boards in New South Wales receiving assistance&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a very important part of the question that the minister should have been able to answer because it dealt more broadly with the inadequacy with which AQIS has been looking at imports of materials which can import diseases into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very serious outbreak in the pilchard population of southern Australia which began in the region off Port Lincoln. It then spread very quickly in the course of some weeks as far west as Cape Leeuwin, right along the southern coast of Australia, around Victoria and a fair way up the east coast of Australia, including the southern part of New South Wales and as far as Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one learns that those carrying out aquaculture in the Port Lincoln region had been importing foreign pilchards to feed the tuna, one becomes extremely suspicious. As one who has had a considerable experience in human epidemiology, this looks very much like a disease which has been imported from a population in which the disease is already well established and well able to cause a very specific disease in a specific population and it has been imported into a virgin population which has had no experience of that disease. Those are the hallmarks of a classic, rapidly spreading epidemic and this, of course, is exactly what we see in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one finds, after some weeks of investigation, that indeed viruses have been found on the gills of the pilchards that have died, one is then very suspicious that this is indeed the cause of this quite alarming outbreak. It does raise the question then of whether, in allowing the importation of the frozen blocks of pilchards from the northern hemisphere, AQIS carried out adequate investigations at two levels. Firstly, to find out whether the Australian population carried particular viruses and had particular immunities; and, secondly, what viruses were carried by the pilchards that were being imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the minister did not answer that part of the question&mdash;and I hope he will eventually provide an answer to that question&mdash;it is highly suspicious, in view of all the circumstances, that AQIS did not carry out those investigations. Indeed, it is just part of the way in which this government has run down public interest research and is not carrying out adequate research on the animals and plants of Australia, including the important viruses which are carried by indigenous species which potentially could then pose a risk to animals elsewhere or conversely bring diseases into Australia. It simply underscores the total inadequacy with which we are protecting the animal populations of Australia from these sorts of imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the question asked later by Senator Calvert. It seems to me that here we have a situation where at least AQIS might be going through the process of an inquiry. I think Senator Calvert, in his question, outlined a number of diseases which may well be imported into Australia which could have devastating consequences for, again, in this case, an imported population but one which is being bred under aquaculture. In this case we have a native species which has been decimated, I believe, by the importation of fish from overseas. I believe that one of the reasons why the minister may not be able to provide an answer is that there may indeed be a massive cover-up in this investigation. AQIS and the government do not want to reveal their ignorance and the incapacity with which they have handled this whole situation. </PARA>

Mr Fountain asks in his letter whether anybody has been able to identify how these diseases have spread from country to country. This is where Senator Coulter raises the question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish that some on the other side had taken the opportunity to actually read the draft risk analysis report, because there is an extensive summary with regard to how the 24 diseases that Senator Calvert mentioned  come about and, indeed, how they can be transmitted, et cetera. Also, he should have acknowledged the fact that under the GATT arrangements we have an obligation with regard to requests from other trading countries who are members of GATT. A request has been made of us, and it has been made on the basis that since 1975 we have had these restrictions in place, which I agree with, I might add, and have stated so publicly. But it is not proper to come in here and misrepresent the facts with regard to the position that AQIS has put in its draft report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AQIS draft report does recognise that some risk exists, but has made an analysis that the risk is minimal. That is a question that Senator Collins has indicated with regard to the importation of products generally and the question raised by Senator Coulter relating to pilchards. If that is the case, that also gives us cause for concern. But it is also worth noting that AQIS has been making some assessment with regard to other products, including the importation of aquarium fish and other fish that are already imported into this country and that may well contain disease. As I understand it, some of the fish can carry some of the pathogens that are part of the 24 diseases listed in this draft import risk analysis. </PARA>

<PARA>The government's recent decision not to allow the parallel importing of CDs is really a travesty and something that this government should be utterly ashamed of. The bottom line is that it means Australians&mdash;mostly young Australians and those on the lower socio-economic end of the scale&mdash;will continue to pay a lot more for CDs, the normal form of music recording. They will probably pay the highest prices in the Western world. They are paying $30 for the normal top of the shelf CD now, which is about $9 more than they would have to pay but for this government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA did a survey last month of six recent releases by major contemporary artists. It showed that Australians were paying almost $8 more per disc than CD buyers in the United States. It showed that New Zealanders were paying, on average, $1.60 less for their CDs, even though they are manufactured in Australia. It found that the average gap between US and Australian CD prices was more than 39 per cent. This decision is nothing more than a tax, mostly on young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's argument about intellectual property has also been shown to be a complete furphy, as I said in my question. Michael Stutchbury had this to say about it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review </EMPHASIS>recently:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parallel importing would allow US wholesalers who legally stock this CD to sell it in a foreign market, such as Australia, as well as in their domestic American market. This is nothing like "piracy" or illegal copying. The US wholesaler would only be exporting product it had bought from the US copyright holder.</PARA>
<PARA>So this copyright excuse is nothing more than that; an excuse which the government scrambled together after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;or Dr Keating, as he is now known&mdash;told the government and cabinet that he wanted to protect the big six and keep this protection racket going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It flies so much in the face of the government's trade liberalisation rhetoric.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contemptuous cynicism implicit in the decision demonstrates a lack of commitment to the concepts of liberalised trade that the Australian Government claims to champion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very accurate condemnation of this disgraceful decision. It really is the continuation of a protection racket for the big six companies that produce and sell CDs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine that many ALP members are ashamed that this is about protecting five big multinationals and one other company that happens to be owned by Rupert Murdoch, who keeps popping up in all sorts of issues nowadays in which the government has a hand. So the big six companies are all being protected by those opposite. They are supposed to be the friends of the worker and the friends of youth. They are supposed to want to look after consumers. They are protecting the big six record companies and making us and our children pay 50 per cent more for their CDs than we would have to but for the government's decision. </PARA>

<PARA>I thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) for his relatively quick response to this very critical issue. At the outset, it is important to place on the record that the actions of Mr Tim Visscher, the officer on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> who initially raised concerns about the potentially unsafe actions on board, and the Greens, in raising the issue in the parliament, were designed to avoid similar occurrences and not to initiate a witch-hunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to note that the government's response acknowledges the important role played by Mr Visscher. As the response states, `Mr Beddall strongly endorses Mr Visscher's role in this incident and emphasises that it is essential for everybody working in the petroleum industry to have a commitment to safety'. I am sure, however, that Mr Visscher would disagree with the finding that `the possibility of an explosion occurring was unlikely, due to the absence of a source of ignition', as evidenced by his detailed submission to the inquiry on that point. But I am also aware that he is pleased that other findings of the investigation have addressed some of the broader issues relating to safety in the petroleum industry and, in particular, in relation to the procedures within BHP Petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given time limitations, I will not discuss the details of the joint federal-state investigation into alleged unsafe acts aboard BHP Petroleum's FPSO<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Griffin Venture </EMPHASIS>on 29 May 1994, but will limit my remarks to the four recommendations and the government's response. I am pleased to see that the government has accepted recommendation 1 and is seeking state and territory government assistance in organising audits of all floating production storage off-loading vessels'&mdash;FPSOs&mdash;operational procedures to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations 2 and 3 have been referred direct to BHP Petroleum for action in relation to conflict resolution procedures and field management systems. During the course of a discussion with senior officials from BHP Petroleum yesterday it appeared that these issues will be treated, we hope, very seriously and action will be taken to avoid similar incidents. The final recommendation is a commendation for Mr Visscher taking action to draw attention to potential incidents. In many cases it takes a lot of courage for someone to stand up, as did Mr Visscher, and draw the attention of his company to an incorrect procedure. If the complaint is not taken seriously enough by the company there is always the risk that such an event will happen again, and next time they will not have a Tim Visscher on board in order to avoid what could have been a catastrophic incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that Mr Visscher is a hero, not a pariah. Unfortunately, BHP Petroleum treated him like a pariah. It is true loyalty to stand up and tell your company what it needs to know. There must be recognition of the necessity that no employee feels unable to speak up on these issues. A hold-up in a cleaning process may cost money, but what would be the cost of an explosion&mdash;human cost and environmental cost, not to mention the public relations cost to BHP if it was responsible for such a disaster. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Ian Macdonald, in a debate on small business, claimed that I had said a number of things. I certainly have no objection to him making value judgments about my performance; that is a matter of public debate. But he said that, at a meeting in Townsville, I had told a group of small businessmen `such as builders and cabinet-makers that this tax on building material will add only $400 to $600 to the cost of a house'. That is not correct. I told a meeting of about 20 small business people in the building industry that I had been advised that the increase in wholesale sales tax on certain building materials would increase the cost of a house from between $400 and $600&mdash;at the bottom, for a more average house&mdash;up to $1,000. As Senator Macdonald was not at the meeting, I think he was misled by information provided to him about the nature of that meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter on which I claim to have been misrepresented by Senator Macdonald in the debate yesterday relates to the same meeting. He said that I did not understand the input of labour in the cost of building materials. I wish to point out that I did understand. I had explained to the meeting that some estimates made about the cost of building materials on the cost of a home were at such a high level that the cost of labour may have been included in the cost of those materials, when in fact it would be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, as a result of people quite rightly seeking information in the discussion that took place over the next half hour, I arranged, with the assistance of Mr Lindsay, the federal member for Herbert, who was present, to have a phone hook-up with officials in Canberra. This would allow the builders present to put directly questions relating to the wholesale sales tax on building materials, and any further queries relating to kitchens and fitouts could be dealt with specifically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in his remarks yesterday, Senator Macdonald said that I misrepresented the facts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to the people of South Australia by deliberately saying to them that the Labor Party was giving regional development $160 million per year each year for the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>To my knowledge and my recollection, I have never knowingly said anywhere in South Australia that we were giving $160 million per year for the next four years for regional development. I may have been reported inadvertently by somebody. I may have said from time to time that $160 million is available for regional development across Australia, but as far as my recollection is concerned I have never said that. I  certainly have never deliberately said that $160 million is available for regional development each year for the next four years. I wanted to put on the record the true facts of those discussions. As Senator Macdonald was not present at any of those discussions, I think it only appropriate that I put the true facts on the record. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill and the associated Dairy Produce Levy No 1 and No 2 bills, is to implement replacement domestic market support arrangements for the Australian dairy industry, to operate from 1 July 1995. The passage of these bills will fulfil the government's commitment to the Australian dairy industry that it will deliver the same levels of support or as near as possible to that which would have been delivered under the 1992 dairy plan, had it continued, including the phased reductions of levels of support, to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to change the domestic support arrangements is a direct and unavoidable consequence of obligations incurred as a result of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current mechanism, involves an `all milk levy' on the production of all milk, which in turn is paid as a `market support payment' on exports. This has the effect of raising domestic prices and therefore facilitating a consumer transfer to producers of manufacturing milk. The `market support payment' has been deemed an export subsidy under the uruguay round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new World Trade Organization agreement, Australia is obliged to reduce its export subsidies in terms of both the volume receiving the subsidy and the total amount paid in dollar terms. The existing mechanism does not allow for practical or acceptable reductions of volumes of exports receiving subsidies. Consequently it has been necessary to change the policy to meet our World Trade Organization membership commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new plan will eliminate export subsidies completely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of executive council conventions, we have already amended the 1992 dairy plan to terminate market support payments by 1 July 1995. This was achieved with the passage of the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Act 1994 last December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the implementation of a replacement mechanism of domestic support to producers of manufacturing milk, making it clearly a domestic support arrangement under the Uruguay Round commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In continuing the phase out of the previously agreed levels of legislated domestic support, the bill provides a secure framework for further dairy industry adjustment, investment, and rationalisation. To date the industry has responded positively to the process of deregulation and lowering levels of support. By any reckoning, the 1986 and 1992 schemes have been extremely successful in assisting with the improvement of the competitive capability of the Australian dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government dairy policy has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, adjustments at the farm level as well as improvement to the competitive operations of manufacturers and processing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a strongly performing and competitive industry. It has recovered from the depressed years of the 1970s but it is now enjoying strong growth as one of our top performing rural industries. The industry is achieving improved economies of scale at the farming and manufacturing level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a very important improvement in the level of research and innovation utilised. These factors taken together are producing an unprecedented level of industry efficiency, product diversification and a period of substantial investment in new plant and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry is now very well positioned to continue to expand and to capture an increased share of the growing Asian markets. Exports of dairy products have set new records of about $1.3 billion in both 1992/93 and 1993/94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new domestic support mechanism this process of restructuring and industry growth will continue and it will place the industry in a very sound position by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new mechanism and arrangements covered by the bill have industry approval and I commend industry for joining in close consultation with the government, in developing them. The main features of the new policy are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current levy imposed on market milk will continue and provide an intra industry transfer from the market milk sector to manufacturing milk producers. It will be paid by producers but collected by manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An additional levy will be imposed on milk manufacturers on the milk used in the manufacture of dairy products other than market milk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This levy will be paid by manufacturers and will subsequently be either reimbursed by a rebate of the levy component of the export, or passed on to domestic consumers through the pricing mechanism on the domestic market. In effect the manufacturers, by passing on the levy component to consumers, achieve the same level of consumer transfer, and no more, than would have resulted had the arrangements negotiated in 1992 been able to follow their course to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imposition of the levies is addressed in the accompanying levy bills and the respective second reading speeches. All dairy levies will be changed to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis for payment by manufacturers for milk received from producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consumer transfer is limited by the maximum levels specified under the 1992 plan which phases down to the year 2000. Our preliminary estimates, and these will most probably be revised, indicate that the level of consumer transfer and the intra-industry transfer together will total around 140 million dollars for 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure the cost to manufacturers of running this new scheme is minimised, manufacturers will be able to offset their levy rebate entitlements for exports in any given month, against the levy liability for that month. In the case of downstream manufacturers who do not pay levy, but who export dairy produce on which levy has been paid, a rebate will be paid by the Australian Dairy Corporation. These downstream manufacturers are responsible for about 5 per cent&mdash;10 per cent of exports. There are no resultant costs to other sectors of society as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that these rebates, of the levy component in exports, whether offset against levy liability or paid direct, will not exceed the levy that would be imposed. In other words, as there is no net benefit to exporters, there is no export subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administration of import offsets will be improved by moving to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis of levies and support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Receipts from the manufacturing and market milk levies over and above the amount needed to reimburse for export sales and administration costs will be paid directly to manufacturing milk producers by the Australian Dairy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor-General will prescribe the rate for the manufacturing levy after taking into consideration a recommendation made to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics after the bureau has consulted the Australian Dairy Corporation. The level of support and thus the manufacturing levy rate will be calculated on an annual basis for the life of this new plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned earlier, the level of support under the new mechanism will be unchanged from that which would have been provided under the 1992 dairy plan had it continued. The impact on domestic prices will be unchanged. The new policy will in fact be an improvement on the 1992 dairy plan as it will be clearly identifiable as a solely domestic support scheme and not an export subsidy which delivers a domestic support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After 30 June 1995, manufacturers will not be able to claim an export support payment on any of the 30 June 1995 stock on hand, which might be exported. Industry practice has been to prepay the expected consumer transfer resulting from the market support payment in the price paid to the producers of milk, on delivery. As market support payments are not paid until produce is exported, manufacturers stand to be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid any disruption to the market and allow manufacturers to recoup this pre-payment, stocks on hand at 30 June 1995 will attract an export rebate at the manufacturers levy rate applicable when exported or the consumer transfer when sold on the domestic market. The export rebate on these stocks will create a debt to the domestic market support fund which will be financed by borrowings by the Australian Dairy Corporation and be repaid by producers of manufactured milk over the life of the scheme, through a reduction in support payments. The Australian Dairy Corporation will be charged with administering the market support fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manufacturers will be allowed an additional one month grace in the deadline for payment of the manufacturing levy so as to offset the increased inventory cost associated with moving to the new scheme. These costs would otherwise have been incurred because manufacturers would have had to pay the levy well in advance of receiving the rebate of the levy on exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For administrative reasons the lagging will have to apply to all the industry levies including the market milk, corporation, research and development and promotion levies. This will not mean a loss of one months receipts from these levies, simply a delay in payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To wind-up the scheme the levy component within all stocks on hand as at 30 June 2000 will be paid out by the fund managed by the Australian Dairy Corporation. In the event of a positive balance in the domestic market support fund, after payment for stocks, the remaining funds will be distributed to the promotion or corporation administration funds to be used in the interests of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event of a deficit balance the Australian Dairy Corporation will draw on the corporation's promotion or administration funds or borrow against those funds to extinguish the debt. Any borrowings will be repaid by an increase in the corporation and/or promotion levy. Either way, there will be no cost or liability to the Commonwealth arising from the completion of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new bill before the house further amends the Dairy Produce Act 1986 as amended and related acts to institute new arrangements which will continue to provide a framework for dairy industry adjustment and a phasing down of support to 30 June in the year 2000 when legislated support terminates. As a result of this bill the capacity to expand and develop the industry will continue and it will be well placed to capture market opportunities as they become available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian dairy industry should then have a competitive edge on all its competitors and be well placed as the natural supplier of dairy product to the expanding markets of the Asia, Pacific rim in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also demonstrates Australia's firm commitment to both the letter and spirit of the world trade organisation agreement, its obligation and the global benefits of trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No. 1) AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives effect to the levy aspects of new dairy market support arrangements beginning on 1 July 1995. These arrangements were outlined in the second reading to the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995. This complements the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1995 all dairy industry levies will be based on the milk fat content and on the protein content of milk consistent with the basis on which manufacturers pay producers for milk supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current all milk levy will be replaced by two separate levies; one imposed on market milk and the other on manufacturing milk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The market milk levy will be imposed on milk received by a manufacturer, as defined in the bill, for processing for consumption as liquid milk in Australia and paid by the producer. This will provide a continuation of the intra-industry transfer from market milk producers to manufacturing milk producers which is inherent in the present scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manufacturing milk levy will be imposed on all other milk received by manufacturers and will be paid by those manufacturers. This levy is the cornerstone of the new support arrangements whereby manufacturers effectively pre-pay a consumer transfer, through the Australian Dairy Corporation, to producers of manufacturing milk and recoup it from consumers in the price of dairy products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the market milk and manufacturing milk levies will be appropriated to the Australian Dairy Corporation for payment to manufacturing milk producers after allowance for various payments described in the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Producers will continue to pay the corporation, promotion and research and development levies which are imposed on all milk received by manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manufacturers will be able to obtain rebate of the manufacturing levy paid on exported dairy products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements manufacturers will be able to reduce their monthly gross manufacturing levy liability by the milk fat and protein rate of levy applied to the respective components of the dairy produce that they exported in that month.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Tierney said in a notice of motion a little while ago, I welcome the fact that the government has belatedly done something about exceptional circumstances in the Hunter and has done a little about exceptional circumstances in other areas. I also note that, in answer to a question today, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) said that there will be something like 14,500 families now being assisted by exceptional drought assistance, including the 4,000 families added to the list as of last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also said that there was a transparency between the New South Wales government and the federal government as to the funding. I hope that transparency extends to supporting the advice of the Premier of New South Wales at lunch time today that, if there were farmers or areas that thought they had been further disadvantaged by last night's announcement, they should contact him and he would put their case to the federal minister. I hope the federal minister is going to listen and not wait until RASAC makes one of its line decisions where it says that a person on one side of a line can get exceptional circumstances and persons on the other side of the line cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all appreciate that, like all droughts, we realise how severe it is only once it is here. I have said that once already today in taking note of the minister's answer. But there has to be some flexibility in the arrangements extended, particularly in the early stages of the drought. Some of these people have been absolutely at their wit's end for quite a time, waiting to know what was going to happen to them and whether they were going to get any assistance or help at all. But we are not in the early stages of this drought. Some areas of New South Wales were first drought declared in 1991, and they still are. They are still not regarded as being serious enough to be included for exceptional circumstances funding. It is high time the government had another look at how RASAC is coming up with the decisions that it is making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go into a little detail. In New South Wales, the Rural Lands Protection Board of Mudgee has just had division B included. Excluded are divisions A, C and D. But they are regarded by the local Rural Lands Protection Board as being as bad as, if not worse than, the one that has been included. I advise the minister that the only difference between divisions B and D is one month of drought declaration. That is how difficult it is and why people feel as though they are being dudded. One person on one side of a line drawn on a map gets help and the other person does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That one month was in May 1993. In other words, two years ago division D was not included in drought declaration but division B was. In the following month, division D was added from June 1993 to September 1993. From June 1994 to June 1995 it has remained drought declared just as division B has&mdash;but B is in and D is out. People out there, the people who are right at the coalface, cannot quite understand that and neither can I. A line on a map does not mean that that is where the rain stops and starts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument given is based on rainfall. That is what the minister said today in answer to a question. Parts of division B are something like 2,400 feet above sea level; whereas division D is 3,000 feet above sea level&mdash;but in both places we are talking about some of the coldest areas in the central west. Nothing will grow in those particular areas before maybe September-October, no matter how much rain they get or have got, because it is just too cold for pasture growth to be promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nyngan is another anomalous area. Nyngan division A is out while Nyngan divisions B, C and D are in. Nyngan A is surrounded by exceptional circumstances areas. This morning I spoke to farmers in the area of Nyngan A who have had one successful crop and two successful lambing crops in the past four years. One farmer's last lambing was 10 lambs from 1,900 ewes. In case honourable senators do not know, that means that that person has forgone a complete income for the year; yet these circumstances are considered not serious enough to be included in exceptional circumstances. His neighbours are in the same position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant Rural Lands Protection Board is completely bewildered. It believes its A division was one of the worst areas in the entire state. The Rural Lands Protection Board is stunned that the balance of Dubbo, Merriwa and Mudgee are not included in exceptional circumstances. The Rural Lands Protection Board in Dubbo is similarly bewildered and angry because it is evident that its advice was not taken. That is where the big concern and the big worry is&mdash;that the advice of people on the ground is not being taken any notice of, and people who are coming from outside are not really understanding the depth of despair and the problems in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When members of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council met with the Rural Lands Protection Board officers, farmers and the Rural Assistance Authority in New South Wales, it was agreed that the inflexibility of the Rural Lands Protection Board boundaries needed to be changed and that there should be grey areas where individual properties could apply to be individually assessed. In other words, as I have already said, rainfall does not stop at the line on a map: it will go in a little further and vary quite considerably over that map. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that you understand the land, even if you live in the city. Even if you live in a place like Canberra, you will know that sometimes rain will go over the southern parts of Canberra and will not go over the northern parts. I do not think any notice has been taken of the Rural Lands Protection Board advice, and it is clear to me that RASAC has not taken any notice of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How long must we wait before assistance is given? We are pushing farmers beyond the levels of viability. In many cases, it is too late to offer the olive branch of assistance to them now. That is basically what has happened here. The minister is doling out assistance like a dripping tap when it should be full bore. He says that the cheque book is open, but it is obvious that the finance heavies in cabinet are getting the better of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to the people out in those farming areas? They have had the drought; they have had commodity problems; and they have had high interest rates. Of course, now we have just had a budget which actually slammed them again with higher fuel costs, wholesale taxes and all the other things that impose costs on the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the minister has once again completely ignored the advice of the Rural Lands Protection Board in New South Wales, and I know that the boards are the ones which determine drought. They determine drought in the first place. If their advice is good enough to determine drought in the first place, why is it that they are ignored when it comes to assessing serious drought? Surely they are the people on the ground who should be able to give a lot more advice, rather than a group called RASAC which comes in from outside. Surely the Rural Lands Protection Board officers&mdash;not RASAC&mdash;are the appropriate people to take advice from. RASAC was set up for rural adjustment. It was not set up to look after drought application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken my office less than 12 hours to basically determine the areas most seriously affected by drought. Why did it take RASAC three months and many on-farm visits to make a decision which it still did not get right? Senator Tierney has already mentioned the Hunter Valley, and I am quite sure that he will add some remarks on the problems there. It is just not fair for the people out there. The minister has to take notice, and it is time that he actually started to get it right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of Senator Brownhill and also to shed some light on the areas of New South Wales that have been greatly disadvantaged by the delays in this government's policies. The $40 million that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) announced today is most welcome, particularly by the deeply distressed families in areas near Scone, Singleton and Merriwa in my area. But one would wonder why on earth it has taken this long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has it taken the minister and his advisers eight months to work out that there is an extreme drought up there? Any travelling through the area, flying over the area, talking to the people, or walking in the paddocks would tell people that this is an extreme drought circumstance. But the minister has left these people in a desperate situation for eight months, going further into debt and having no cash flow at all. This would not happen to people in the cities, but it did happen to people in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happened because of the department's ineptitude in working out a suitable rainfall criteria for drought. In areas like the Upper Hunter you cannot just take total rainfall figures. One farmer on his property showed me the effects of 10 inches of rain in a period of 24 hours. It filled his dams with mud and destroyed his fences, and two weeks later the area had totally dried out again. But on an average rainfall over the month that looked like a good figure. It was not. The intensity of the rainfall has to be taken into account. The other thing that must be taken into account in the Upper Hunter is the distribution across the area. It can be raining in Merriwa and in Scone there is no rain at all. That happened earlier this year in January when there were some good rains in some areas of the Upper Hunter and others got nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government had a criteria that drought had to occur in 24 out of 36 months. What is magic about 36 months? It is totally arbitrary. If the government had gone back 48 months in the Upper Hunter, it would have found that the area had another 12 months of drought that it was not even including. So because of these arbitrary measures, because the federal department and RASAC could not get their act together on the correct criteria, people in the Upper Hunter have been suffering unnecessarily and not receiving drought assistance when many of their cousins in other parts of the country who were in relatively better circumstances were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should have been obvious to this government much earlier that there was a major problem with the way in which it was going about these things. Yet in September the government did not include the Upper Hunter. When the December figures came out and we thought, `They must get in this time,' they were not included. We took a delegation to see the minister in early February and he said there would be a decision by the end of March. Here it is the end of May and we have finally got a decision out of this minister. It is welcome, but it is incredibly late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the effects of this late decision on the people of the Upper Hunter. Many of them were actually debt free producers. Great numbers of them are now $250,000 in debt. If you are a primary producer, if you have lost your herd, if you have sold your herd, how on earth are you going to generate the income stream from rebuilding your stock to make that a viable business again? It is a matter that will take years. Many of them have had to rely on Farmhand. The  Samaritans were spending 90 per cent of their rural money in the Upper Hunter. That should have said something to the government, but it did not. Of course, there are more widespread effects. It is not just farmers, but also small businesses who supply farmers who are also experiencing severe poverty. But what was this government doing about it? Absolutely nothing until today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would not treat people in the city like this. If people do not have any cash flow, they are entitled to jobstart benefits. They are entitled to Austudy and health cards, but this did not happen in the Upper Hunter. Now that they do have this sort of assistance, the minister has only promised it for six months, but, of course, the recovery, as I have indicated, for breeding herds and other related farm generation of income will take a lot longer than that. We really need the minister to promise to keep this aid to the Upper Hunter for at least one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be watching very carefully what happens with this money. We will be investigating exactly how much money has been paid out so far. It is not as much, we suspect, as the government has announced in various figures. We must support the rural industries of this country. They have been the backbone that has led to the great prosperity of this nation and when they do reach a time of need, it behoves the government to support them properly and in a timely way, to come in early enough so that they have an opportunity to build back quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened as a result of this government's policy has been too little, too late. It has forced these people to the point of bankruptcy and they will have great difficulty in recovering. Let us hope that what comes out of this is that the government will develop proper mechanisms, a proper way of assessing what is extreme drought, and will respond in a more timely manner than it has done this time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The federal government agency responsible for domestic meat inspection in the USA under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 1906 is the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). FSIS did introduce additional measures in response to the so called `Jack-in-the-Box' incident in north-western USA that occurred in January/February 1993. These measures were part of FSIS's Track I and Track II Pathogen Reduction Program (PRP) initiatives. PRP included a requirement for zero faecal/ingesta contamination of beef carcases to be evident after dressing. AQIS subsequently responded to an FSIS request for information on initiatives taken in Australia to maintain comparability of the Australian system with the revised US requirements. AQIS advised FSIS that it had taken action to implement the zero contamination requirement at dressing, had tightened boneless beef re-inspection requirements, and industry had begun microbiological monitoring programs of meat contact surfaces at all USDA-listed abattoirs and boning rooms. This action was taken through a work procedure notice to AQIS staff and industry in July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. In September 1994 FSIS did introduce a requirement for monitoring of boneless ground beef for E.coli O157:H7. However, essentially all beef exported to the USA from Australia is cartoned boneless beef and is not ground; hence the particular requirements of the ground beef program do not apply. In the event that an Australian processor does wish to export ground beef, the new US requirements will be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Inspection standards at domestic abattoirs are the responsibility of State Governments. At the last Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) meeting on 3 March 1995, State and Territory Ministers agreed that adherence to those parts of the current Code of Practice for the Hygienic Production and Inspection of Meat for Human Consumption in Australia relevant to health should be required in legislation, with appropriate sanctions for non-compliance, by December 1995. The Ministers also agreed that officials should review the above code and other relevant codes of practice to ensure that they remained relevant and contemporary and to report back to ARMCANZ 6 in August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia exports meat to over 100 countries, many of which may not have the same regulatory requirements for the health and hygiene of domestic meat processing as Australia. Almost all meat exported from Australia has been inspected in accordance with the Australian export inspection standard. There are minor quantities of meat exported as small non-commercial consignments (less than 10 kg) and certain other instances where exemptions have been given from the provisions of the Export Control Act, 1982 and subordinate legislation and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The standard of domestic meat inspection in the States and Territories of Australia should be consistent with the Code of Practice for the Hygienic Production and Inspection of Meat for Human Consumption. The review of the code sought by ARMCANZ referred to in the answer to Question 4 seeks to establish a health standard for the domestic meat that is reflective of Australia's excellent animal and public health situation and provides health protection to an equivalent level to that of the export sector. The export standards contained in the Export Control Act 1982 and subordinate legislation must take account of additional requirements imposed by importing country authorities and therefore differ in detail from the domestic standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. There are no certification requirements for domestic meat. Legislative provisions are directed at requirements for hygienic production, storage and transport of the product and its inspection at ante- and post-mortem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) State and Territory Governments are responsible for adopting and enforcing meat inspection standards within their boundaries. The ARMCANZ review referred to in answer to Question 4 is directed at a national standard to be enforced by relevant authorities in each State and Territory.</PARA>
