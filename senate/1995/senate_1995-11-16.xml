<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Public Service Determination 1995/58, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 21 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Determination was made on 16 June 1995. Clause 4.1, which commenced retrospectively on 1 March 1995, provided for salary increases for named unattached secretaries, one of whom was Mr C C Halton.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4.2, for which no commencement date is specified, provides for the deletion of Mr Halton's name from the list of relevant secretaries. The Explanatory Memorandum advises that Mr Halton retired on 5 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for your advice on when Mr Halton ceased to be entitled to the salary provided for him by this Determination.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 22 September 1995 about Public Service Determination 1995/58 which amends Determination 1984/24.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 82D(4) of the Public Service Act 1922, provides that determinations may make provision for salaries of officers, including unattached officers, of the Australian Public Service. Determination 1984/24, in part, provided a personal rate of salary for Mr C C Halton, an unattached officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Halton ceased to be an officer on 5 May 1995 on his retirement from the APS under section 76B of the Act. As a consequence, Determination 1984/24 ceased to apply from that date and the effect of the amendment made by Determination 1995/58 is to remove an already redundant provision.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for your advice on whether such mandatory reports are required by legislative authority or whether they will be obtained by administrative means.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 22 September 1995 concerning the Determination of Technical Standard Notice TN5 of 1995, End-to-End Performance Network No. TS 27&mdash;1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You sought detailed advice to clarify some aspects of the proposed Standard, in particular the nature of the authority for Carriers "to regularly report to AUSTEL to demonstrate compliance with the standard" (Clause 5 of the Explanatory Statement), and also the avenues of review in the case of AUSTEL identifying non-compliance with the standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTEL has power under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to require regular reporting by carriers on their compliance with the Standard. Under s45 it has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, the performance of its functions. Sections 46 and 400 of the Act provide AUSTEL with power to direct carriers to provide it with information or documents relevant to the performance of its functions. Section 401 similarly enables AUSTEL to require the same of persons other than carriers. Relevant AUSTEL functions under the Act include the protection of the public interest [s38(1)], and reviewing and reporting on carrier performance [s4O].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also a condition of the Service Providers Class Licence that suppliers comply with AUSTEL's requirements relating to the giving of information and documents to AUSTEL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the review of any adverse AUSTEL decisions about compliance, it has been AUSTEL's practice to attempt to deal with any compliance problems by negotiation before taking more formal measures to enforce a licence condition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legally, it is a licence condition that carriers comply with technical standards about network matters under s245. In order for AUSTEL to conclude that that condition had been breached, it would need to investigate under Part 15 of the Act. This could be either in response to a complaint, on AUSTEL's own initiative, or at the request of the Minister. As a result of such an investigation, under s343 AUSTEL can direct a carrier to remedy the licence condition contravention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two types of appeal open to a carrier if it wishes to have an AUSTEL decision reviewed, namely through the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (AD(JR)) or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). The nature of the appeal will determine which is the appropriate avenue for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of AD(JR), aspects of AUSTEL's decision that could be subject to judicial review include: the decision to investigate, any aspect of the investigation, AUSTEL's findings, and the decision to give a direction under s343 of the Act. This review would relate to questions of law, not to the merits of AUSTEL's decision. The Act does not provide for merits review of such a decision by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to service providers who are not carriers, it is a condition of the Class Licence that they comply with technical standards about network matters [clause (5)]. Where a supplier breaches a condition of the licence, AUSTEL could take action to declare the service unlicensed under Subdivision E, Division 3, Part 10 of the Act [as per clause (9)]. Subdivision E incorporates natural justice requirements and a mechanism for AUSTEL to reconsider its decision to give such a declaration. AUSTEL can also go further and direct carriers and suppliers to disconnect or not to connect a service the subject of a declaration under Division 4 of Part 10 of the Act. Any of these AUSTEL decisions, that is: to give a declaration; to confirm a declaration upon reconsideration, in connection with its investigation; or to give a direction; would also be reviewable under the AD(JR) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s397(i)(d) of the Act there is provision for the AAT to review a decision made by AUSTEL under s230 concerning a decision to make a declaration that a service is unlicensed in the circumstances outlined in the above paragraph. However, the Act does not provide for AAT review of other AUSTEL decisions under Divisions 3 and 4 of Part 10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTEL has confirmed that there is a typographical error in paragraph 18 of the Explanatory Statement. The paragraph should refer to paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Statement as the Committee has suggested.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Employment Services (Participants) Determination No.2 of 1995 and to the Employment Services (Terminating Events) Determination No.2 of 1995, made under s.25 and s.26 respectively of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Employment Services Act 1994</EMPHASIS>, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 21 September 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the Participants Determination refers to the Disability Reform Package Strategy and to other strategies, packages and initiatives. Clause 4 of the Terminating Events Determination also refers to the Disability Reform Package Strategy. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether the Determinations refer to these strategies and other instruments as in force at the time the Determination came into effect, or whether there is legislative authority for them to be applied as in force from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Determinations provide for the exercise of discretions which may have serious adverse effects on individuals. For instance, under the Participants Determination people may be assessed as being at high risk of becoming long term unemployed, of being substantially adversely affected in employment as a result of a decision not to release a forest coupe from a protection list and of having a capacity to work certain hours. Under the Terminating Events Determination the Employment Secretary may decide whether a client has unreasonably delayed entering into a Case Management activity agreement or taken reasonable steps to comply with the terms of such an Agreement. There is no indication in the Explanatory Statement of review of the merits of adverse decisions. The Committee would welcome your advice on this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above, the Terminating Events Determination confers specific powers on the Employment Secretary. The Committee asks whether there is legislative authority for these powers to be delegated and, if so, to whom?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 22 September 1995 in which you seek advice on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances about the Employment Services (Participants) Determination No. 2 of 1995 and the Employment Services (Terminating Events) Determination No. 2 of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Determinations were notified in the Commonwealth Gazette of 17 July 1995. The changed Determinations take account of Budget decisions relating to seasonal and part-time workers to enable these workers to choose to become participants in the case management system and a number of other changes which clarify and formalise existing policy, including access to case management for people covered by the Forest Industry Special Assistance Package and Labour Adjustment Packages (LAPs).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I provide the following information for the Committee's consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Status of strategies, packages and initiatives references in Clause 4 of the Participants and Terminating Events Determinations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted on the status of the Determinations in relation to their reference to particular strategies, packages and initiatives. Its advice confirms that such references are to the strategy or initiative in existence from time to time and that such references are appropriate within the terms of the enabling provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The exercise and delegation of a Discretionary power under the Determinations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You noted that the Employment Services (Participants) Determination provides discretionary powers to classify a jobseeker as being at high risk of becoming long term unemployed, of being substantially adversely affected in employment as a result of a decision not to release a forest coupe from a protection list and of having a capacity to work certain hours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions made under these powers provide jobseekers with early access to DEET labour market programs and case management. It is hoped that with this early intervention any identified barriers jobseekers may have to finding employment will be overcome and they will not become long term unemployed. I believe that decisions classifying jobseekers in this way are not ones which could be considered adverse to them. In fact, the changed determinations extend the classes of persons who can obtain case management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar provisions relating to the assessment of at high risk status were included in the Employment Services (Participants) Determination No. 1 of 1995 which the present Determination replaced. The provision for access to case management services by former forest industry workers and their partners is an additional measure in the present Determination. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You make reference to the Participants Determination in respect to a person having to work a certain number of hours. The only reference in the Participants Determination is to a part-time employee. In this regard the hours are a matter of fact and are either 20 or 35 hours for part-time workers. There is no exercise of a discretion on the part of the Employment Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the reference was meant to relate to the provision in the terminating events for participants in the Disability Reform Package this reference was included in the Employment Services (Terminating Events) Determination No. 1 of 1995 which the present Determination replaced. The Determination reflects arrangements and decisions which are made, independent of the case management arrangements, through the Disability Reform Package Panel which is convened by the Department of Social Security and includes specialist membership from the Department of Human Services and Health and the Department of Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4.10 of the Employment Services Act 1994 (the Act) provides for internal and external merits review of certain decisions made under the Act. The external reviews are to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal which is established under the Social Security Act 1991. Section 145 of the Act provides that a "reviewable decision" includes a decision of the Employment Secretary or the CES under Part 4.2. Therefore, a decision taken in relation to the status of an individual as a participant in the case management system or in relation to terminating events affecting the individual is subject to merits review if the person is dissatisfied with the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have also inquired about the reference to the powers of the Employment Secretary in relation to the Terminating Events Determination, in particular paragraph 5.1(1) which provides for a terminating event to apply to a person not in receipt of job search allowance, youth training allowance or newstart allowance who:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)unreasonably delays entering into a Case Management Activity Agreement (CMAA), or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)has not taken reasonable steps to comply with the terms of a CMAA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a person in receipt of allowance, a failure to comply with the above requirements may result in the imposition of a deferment period (see section 45 of the Act) and if the deferment period is of a certain length of time then a terminating event applies (see paragraphs 5.1(e), (f) and (g) of the Terminating Events Determination). A terminating event, however, is required for the situation where a participant is not in receipt of allowance and is unreasonably failing to comply with his or her reciprocal obligations. This is the purpose of paragraph 5.1(1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to subparagraph 5.1(1)(i), the decision about unreasonably delaying entering into a CMAA is, in effect, similar to that taken under section 44 of the Act which deals with the failure to negotiate a CMAA. The Employment Secretary's powers under that section are specifically delegable under section 47 of the Act. There is no specific provision concerning the delegation of the powers of the Employment Secretary under the Determination. However, I am advised that powers of the Employment Secretary under the instrument would be taken to be delegable under general law principles in that he or she would not be expected to exercise this power personally in each case and may appoint others to act for him or her (otherwise known as the Carltona doctrine from the case of Carltona Ltd v Commissioner of Public Works [1943] 2 A11 ER 560).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to subparagraph 5.1(1)(ii), the decision about unreasonably delaying entering into a CMAA is not a decision taken under the Act (similar provisions in relation to persons in receipt of allowance are taken via the application by the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 by the operation of section 45). Again, the powers of the Employment Secretary would be taken to be delegable under the Carltona principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether decisions under paragraph 5.1(1) are, in effect, taken under the Act or the Determination, they would be subject to merits review under Part 4.10 of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 22 September 1995 indicating the concerns of Committee with new regulation 1.04(4B) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations (`SIS Regulations'). That regulation was inserted into the SIS Regulations by r.2.01 of Statutory Rule No. 240 of 1995. The Committee has queried whether the new regulation is inconsistent with the restriction on prescribing matters in regulations by reference to other instruments contained in s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (AIA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that that on 16 October 1995 you lodged a notice of a motion to disallow Statutory Rule No. 240 of 1995 (of which regulation 1.04(4B) forms a part).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Schedule 1AA of the SIS Regulations lists a number of `exempt public sector schemes'. Such `exempt' State and Territory schemes are not required to comply with the SIS legislation per se, but rather with the principles it reflects (as set out in the Heads of Government Agreement entered into with respect to `exempt' schemes). The schedule is arranged by jurisdiction with schemes being identified by reference to the legislation under which they have been established (under the heading `schemes established by or under') or by name (under the heading `schemes established under trust deeds').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 1.04(4B) states: `If a scheme listed in Schedule 1AA is re-named, the reference to that scheme includes a reference to the scheme as re-named'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of s.49A of the AIA on proposed regulation 1.04(4B) was considered by the ISC and the Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney-General's Department during the course of the drafting process. The Attorney-General's Department considers that because regulation 1.04(4B) makes no reference to the instrument from which a changed name derives but refers, instead, directly to the fact of the name of the scheme having changed (an objective fact) s.49A is not infringed. For example a reference in regulations to a registered medical practitioner would not infringe s.49A while a reference to a person whose name is on a specified roll of registered medical practitioners would.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the Attorney-General's Department view that regulation 1.04(4B) is valid, I seek your confirmation that the notice of motion to disallow Statutory Rule No. 240 of 1995 (of which the regulation is part) will not, in this case, be pursued.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Prawn Export Levies and Charges Regulations, Statutory Rules 1995 No.245, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 21 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 4 provides for the measurement of ships for the purposes of the prawn boat levy. Subregulation 4(2) provides that if the length of the ship is disputed, the length may be determined by a surveyor employed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority with the costs being borne by the owner of the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reasons why such reviews are to be conducted by a paid employee of a statutory authority and why the costs are to be met by the owners. In this context, section 8 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990</EMPHASIS> provides that the Minister may give written directions to the AMSA, although these may only be of a general nature. The appearance of independence may be enhanced if the review, or an appeal from a review, could be undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 22 September 1995 concerning the measurement of the length of a ship under the Prawn Export Promotion Levies and Charges Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations were framed on the basis that a majority of the boats concerned are registered under the Shipping Registration Act 1981. In the small number of cases where there is likely to be a dispute over the length of a boat, it was considered equitable that the matter be settled by the authority which had already measured a majority of the boats that are subject to the prawn boat levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, the Regulations were drafted with a view to keeping the dispute settlement procedure simple. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is a Commonwealth agency whose charter enables it to provide, on request, services to the maritime industry on a commercial basis. If the Regulation contained a broader definition of the agencies entitled to carry out the measurement function, arrangements would need to be made through AMSA or other accredited organisations to confirm the credentials of the surveyor carrying out the task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that AMSA operates on the basis of cost recovery from the users of its services and I understand that any other Organisation performing the same function would similarly charge for its services. The requirement that the boat owner meet these costs is consistent with the `user pays' principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 8 of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 refers to the powers of the Minister administering that Act to give directions to AMSA. There would appear to be no need for any action of this type in relation to prawn boats as AMSA has indicated that it would carry out the abovementioned function as a routine service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regarding the insertion of an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) provision in these Regulations, my understanding is that the primary point of reference for the measurement of boats is the Shipping Registration Act, which does contain AAT appeal provisions. However, in light of your Committee's concerns, I would propose that the matter be put beyond doubt by including a right of appeal to the AAT when the Regulations are next amended.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter was referred to the Attorney-General's Department.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">A BILL TO AMEND THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION ACT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN SPRING SITTINGS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose of Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To increase the flexibility of the Commission's operations by three minor amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment allows for Commissioners to be appointed on a part-time basis in addition to the current full-time basis. This will increase the Commission's chances of attracting suitably qualified people on a permanent part-time basis. The Commission has had difficulties in attracting a more diverse range of applicants. In particular, these changes will allow the Commission to recruit more women Commissioners and those who hold other positions and are unwilling to become full-time Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment will increase the maximum number of Commissioners, other than the chairman, from eight to eleven. This necessarily follows the first amendment, as the Commission will need to maintain the same level of resources at the Commissioner level, requiring more Commissioners in total if there are to be part-time appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment will allow one Commissioner, in emergency situations, to constitute a quorum for public hearings rather than the current two. This will allow the Commission to continue its normal public hearing processes where two Commissioners cannot be present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for seeking introduction and passage of the Bill in the 1995 Spring Sittings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The urgency of this Bill is related to the amendment which allows the Government to appoint Commissioners on a permanent part-time basis. Due to a serious illness, a current Commissioner is having great difficulty sustaining full-time appointment. Under the current Act, this Commissioner is only able to work part-time by being downgraded to an Associate Commissioner, with very detrimental effects on work entitlements, including superannuation. The proposed amendment would allow the Commissioner to be reappointed on a part-time basis. This would reduce the Commissioner's workload&mdash;with benefits to health&mdash;but without any significant erosion of existing employment conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the serious nature of the Commissioner's illness, it is essential and time critical that this amendment be introduced and passed in the Spring Sittings to ensure that this person is not penalised simply because of the inflexibility of the relevant provisions of the Industry Commission Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will contain provisions to amend the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal so as to enable it to deal more efficiently and directly with complaints regarding life office superannuation products and medical evidence complaints involving life office decisions. The Government has made a commitment that the Tribunal will be able to deal effectively and efficiently with medical evidence complaints from 1 November 1995 and wishes to honour its commitment by ensuring that the necessary amendments to enable the Tribunal to deal with such complaints in an effective and efficient manner are in place by that date;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also `transfer' a number of temporary modification declarations made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner under Part 29 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) into the actual body of the SIS Act itself. The SIS Act provides that these temporary declarations (which in effect represent part of the Act) will cease to have effect from 30 June 1996. Unless legislation to replace these declarations is included in the SIS Act well in advance of this date then serious disruption could be caused to significant parts of the superannuation industry. For example, many small (less than 5 member) funds would suddenly, and inappropriately, be classified as `public offer funds' and the trustee of such funds (which is often `mum or dad') would need to become a corporate trustee, be approved by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and meet stringent financial backing requirements (such as having $5 million in net tangible assets). It is considered essential that these amendments are passed in the Spring Sittings to avoid problems of this sort emerging and to provide the necessary comfort to industry well in advance of the 30 June 1996 cut off date. This will ensure industry does not (to the likely detriment of members) begin rearranging its affairs because of a belief that the amendments will not be in place by 30 June 1996.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Customs Tariff Bill 1995 will give effect to the extensive classification changes in the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System of the World Customs Organisation. The changes affect  1/3 of the current Customs Tariff Act 1987, and this Bill will effectively introduce a new Tariff Bill, in much the same way as the current 1987 Tariff replaced the 1982 Tariff following a similar international harmonisation exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary consideration of the Bill this Sittings is necessary primarily because of the 6 month lead time which this legislation requires before its commencement.

Australia has indicated its preparedness to have the new system in by 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To accommodate that mid-year commencement, the Bill will need to be in place by at least 1 January 1996.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a close correspondence between the job search allowance provisions contained in the Social Security Act 1991 and the Youth Training Allowance provisions contained in the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. The Department of Social Security administers both payments, the Youth Training Allowance on behalf of DEET. These factors necessitate that the provisions operate in the same manner and that any changes to one set of provisions are taken up in the other set at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional youth training allowance measures are to be included in the Bill which would also mirror a number of Budget-related proposals being put forward by the Minister for Social Security and contained in the proposed Social Security (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which is in the Program for the Spring Sittings and scheduled for introduction and passage. That status will enable as early passage of the Bill as possible so that the development of supporting administrative systems can be finalised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure honourable senators and many other interested parties will be relieved to see that the committee has finally been able to present its report on this matter. This report has taken some considerable time in gestation. That delay is not necessarily the fault of the committee because originally, senators will recall, the committee was required to consider the outcome of the auditor's report on ANL as well. With that constraint placed upon us, we took the responsible attitude of starting our proceedings after the auditor's report was made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In receiving evidence, we were able to compile, and the report reveals, a chronology of events surrounding the conduct of the sale of ANL so far. I would say in passing that the matter is not yet concluded either. That chronology is presented in the report and may serve as being illustrative to some people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter the committee was able to address was what it actually is that is being sold. That is not as simple as it might first appear. To say that what is proposed for sale is the Australian National Line does not necessarily mean anything because several different people can have different ideas as to what the Australian National Line is. That fact brought on a great deal of discussion about what was the actual value of that property. At page 9, in conclusion 2.17, the report records:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agrees that the various valuations of ANL that are available are not necessarily directly comparable, in that they are based on very different assumptions. The Committee does not intend to comment upon the validity of these assumptions, other than to say that there appears to be scope for disagreement among commercial experts.</PARA>
<PARA>I might interpolate that disagreement there certainly was, and that provided the committee with some degree of difficulty in determining the different assumptions and the different bases upon which those assumptions have been made. Our conclusion continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not appear, however, that the relevance of any one valuation can only be determined within the context of the assumptions upon which it is based. In the view of some members of the Committee, the `fire sale' assumptions of PWSB may have had a negative influence in determining the value of ANL and its assets.</PARA>
<PARA>That in some way gives a hint to the direction of the entire inquiry. We were presented with evidence from experts which was not always directly comparable. It was very challenging for the committee to have to deal with those differing opinions and, in many cases, facts based on different criteria, and resolving those differences was a matter the committee took very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report consists of a report of the evidence that was given to us and an indication as to where further evidence can be examined by interested people. We drew conclusions from that evidence. I will highlight to the Senate this morning just a couple more of the conclusions that the committee was able to draw. At page 12, conclusion 3.16, we concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that a decision was made to sell ANL, the Committee is concerned that the sale process has lasted for over four years.</PARA>
<PARA>I think everybody should be concerned about the length of time this process has taken. Further, our conclusion reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee appreciates the point made by Stephen Sedgwick, Secretary of the Department of Finance, that, in the initial stages, the Government may have needed to refine its options, and that this was the purpose of the scoping study. Nevertheless, the process was initiated via the scoping study in 1991. For a variety of reasons, the sale clearly has not proceeded in a timely fashion.</PARA>
<PARA>There are other conclusions that we reach about the process, the length of time that it took and how it was conducted. But another highlight, for example, is our conclusion 3.20 on page 13, where the committee agrees with the point made by the Australian National Audit Office that the board should have been provided with the PWSB report prior to its release. That is symptomatic of the problems that the committee was able to identify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During its examination, the Australian National Audit Office found many instances where, if communication had been improved and if information had been shared, then some of the criticisms levelled at the process would not have applied. The committee could only but agree with those findings of the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take too much more time on this because I think that the report is particularly clear and plain and not particularly lengthy, so if any particular senator wanted to pursue it any further, he or she would be well rewarded with reading the report in its entirety. However, I point out that under our conclusions and recommendations in part 5 on page 15, the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that there is little to be gained from an assignment of `blame' for each difficult circumstance throughout the ANL sale process, although most members agree that more could have been done by the Department of Finance TFAS, and that both the actions of the Minister and the protracted decision making process of the Government were not helpful. The Committee believes that the Government can and should learn from this experience.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the proposed sale of ANL is one of the more important reports produced by the Senate. I congratulate my colleague Senator Gibson for initiating this inquiry, as he did, some 11 months ago and congratulate the secretariat, in particular the secretary, Sue Morton, on its production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has, as the chairman said, been long in gestation but very valuable and I think is something that will be referred to for many years to come. I am pleased to see that it is, in fact, a bipartisan report with members of all parties signing up to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important report because it documents for all time an extraordinary saga of incompetence on the part of the Labor government&mdash;incompetence over a four-year period of real soap opera proportions. Four years have elapsed since the government made the proper decision to sell ANL, yet this company is still not sold, which compares most unfavourably with the actions of various state governments, most of them Liberal, in their disposal of government assets properly, in due time and for good returns to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry, of course, was prompted by the remarkable comments by the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, back in, I think, August of last year where he said, `You couldn't give it away', when he referred to ANL, a taxpayer owned asset. Of course, Laurie Brereton, Minister Brereton, as usual, is quite wrong. In fact, the government is giving ANL away. What will happen, presumably, some time around the end of this month is that P&amp;O will take over ANL for virtually no return to the taxpayer whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Mr Brereton is wrong. We are giving ANL away. The taxpayer will get nothing for this company. The minister's statement back in August of 1994, which really was the catalyst for this inquiry, was incredibly improper and irresponsible for the person charged with the ownership and control of a major government asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bolitho, the former chairman, said the following. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the actions and statements of the Minister were a deliberate and substantial devaluation of the work of ANL and impairment of its sale prospects, and were deliberately and substantially damaging to the commercial reputations of the directors of the Board of ANL at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very hard to disagree with that. The report says in its conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the view of the majority of members&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I note that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the statements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>made by Minister Brereton&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">carried the potential to have a negative influence on the interests of the Commonwealth and they question the prudence of the Minister's conduct in making statements which were potentially damaging to the sale process without providing the full documentation relied upon to support those statements.</PARA>
<PARA>The real import of this report is how irresponsible Minister Brereton has been in his handling of this whole saga. He has been utterly incompetent in the handling of so many issues. We now have a major waterfront strike largely as a result of Minister Brereton's incompetence on industrial relations, his incompetence on the airport, et cetera. The sagas that are attached to this minister are unbelievable. I am amazed that he remains a minister in the government. It can only be as a result of particular friendships he has in New South Wales. His treatment of the former board, in particular, was disgraceful. That was referred to by Mr Bolitho. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we congratulate the former chairman, Mr Bill Bolitho, on his courage in taking a public stand on this issue. He could have just withered away after the extraordinary debacle back in August 1994 when the whole board was sacked. Instead he took a public stand. He stood up to this bullying government and this bullying minister and pointed out the drastic consequences of what the minister had done, the damage the minister had done to this national asset, ANL. He and his colleagues on that board have been treated in a most appalling way by the minister and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear to me and to other members, from both sides of the chamber, on this committee that Mr Bolitho is a man of great sincerity and integrity, a man who devoted many years of his life to building up this public asset. He took it over back in the early 1980s when it was obviously in a very sick state and devoted a decade of his life&mdash;full-time for what was a paltry part-time chairman's remuneration&mdash;to building up ANL. But ever since the government made the decision to sell the company back in 1991 it has been a downhill run for that company to the point now where we will get absolutely nothing back from the investment which people like Mr Bill Bolitho made in the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be tragic for him, in particular, to see what has happened to the company he chaired. It must be particularly galling for him to see what occurred after August 1994 when Mr Brereton's good friend the Hon. Neville Wran QC was made chairman of the company for what was initially six months but was then extended to 12 months. He was paid $300,000 for one year's part-time work to chair this company. As we learnt, poor old Mr Bolitho got $40,000 per year to work probably 80 hours a week to try to resuscitate the company. It must be very painful for Mr Bolitho to see what has occurred in the 12 months since he was summarily dismissed. The total bill for the Wran board was $816,000, which is nearly 20 per cent of the best we might get for the company. It will probably end up being about the same amount we will receive for the same company&mdash;an extraordinary amount of money doled out in one year to one board, two of whom coincidentally happen to be good friends of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry is a manual on how not to sell a government business. That is why it will stand in good stead for many years to come. Anyone who wants to know how you do not go about selling a business should read this report first. It documents the extraordinary saga. It is a dramatic example of this government's incompetence. There are many lessons to be learnt by the government, but this government will only be here for a few months, so it is a bit late for the government. There are many lessons to be learnt by the bureaucracy in how to go about a proper sale process under a responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst part of this whole saga is the extraordinary cost to the taxpayer. Millions upon millions of dollars have been washed away by the incompetence of the government largely as a result of its sordid and unhealthy relationship with the trade union movement in this country. Much of the problem derives from the relationship with the union movement, the government's incapacity to act in the national interest because of its regard for the special interests of one trade union in this case. Now we see the government standing on the sidelines in the face of the trade union movement shutting down the whole country. ANL is a particular example of this government's lack of regard for the national interest and its undue regard for the special interests of the trade union movement. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major interest of the Greens in giving support to the inquiry was to see whether it was possible&mdash;this is one regret that I have&mdash;to enable the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee to look at the wider public interest in dealing with the application of a government business enterprise. Unfortunately, that was not able to happen in this committee. There were obviously particular interests in the financial dealings of the committee. There was also a problem, as was mentioned, in relation to the tabling of the Auditor-General's report. It was always under the assumption that the inquiry would meet and have hearings after the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all realised that part of the problem was getting the Auditor-General's report authorised. A limited Auditor-General's report was able to be authorised because the minister would not allow a full Auditor-General's report to be undertaken. Eventually, after the sale of the ANL, we might get a full ANL report. It is unfortunate that there was not the cooperation of the minister at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the late arrival of the Auditor-General's report, the whole working of the committee was delayed. This means that some people in various maritime communities that I know in Western Australia who are concerned about the quality of the shipping issue were caught off guard. By the time the Auditor-General's report came out, the deadline for placing submissions to the committee had passed. Although there was a willingness by the committee to accept submissions after that, it really caught people off guard. There perhaps were not as many public submissions. The committee was then unable to organise to take those kind of concerns fully into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I continue to hope that we do not always continue to separate issues of the accountability of the public interest from the dollar interest. I hope that at some stage in the future this might be continued in another sense. A public administration and finance committee in this place should be able to factor in the possible social costs of the public interest into the way that they deliberate on an outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along the way, I had concerns with the way that the figures in the books of ANL have been used and manipulated. It was a real pity to see the lack of information that was provided to the people who ought to have known along the way, including the taxpayer. This is a government business enterprise. It brings into sharp focus the concerns that I and other people in this chamber have had about the level of accountability of government business enterprises to the parliamentary process; that is, back to the people who are the stockholders of such enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that there is mention of concerns about shipping standards and safety. I am not saying that ANL was the best run shipping line in the world or perhaps even in Australia. My concern is that, if we lose any benchmarks for standards in Australia, the benchmark of good standard shipping becomes that of the best available. We have had a growing number of single voyage permits issued in Australia because there was no other available shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a competing down of standards. The consequence will be a competing down of the level of construction of ships, the crewing levels, the crewing standards, roster times for crews, ballast water treatment, use of oily waste or other standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the shipping industry throughout the world is part of the internationalisation process as a result of the Uruguay Round of GATT. Ironically, the outcome will not mean greater competition internationally. The outcome seems to be fewer and fewer major players, whom we may well be held captive to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will have an impact on Australian shipping. It will have an impact on the services available. It means we may not have the choice of a benchmark for standards of environmental quality. As one of the witnesses said, to rely on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is a bit like our relying on AQIS once the rules of international trade and international quarantine are adopted. It is like one person standing at the floodgate. That person has the choice of allowing things to happen and hoping for the best or letting things change and destroy the industry that exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the inevitable. I am very sad to have to accept the inevitable. I hope my attempt at incorporating the wider public interest provisions in such an inquiry is not seen as an exercise that was tried and failed. I hope it will be repeated some time in the future and that we do not just plonk public interest into another committee and forget that everything we do economically has other implications and that we need to take them into our equations when we are making decisions such as the sale of our national assets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the proposed sale of ANL. The first thing I should do is commend Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette for supporting the coalition on 8 December last year to get through the Senate the motion which resulted in this report which followed the investigation and uncovering of all the evidence of mismanagement by the government through this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very well documented by my colleague Senator Minchin and by Senator Bell, the chairman of the committee. Even though the Australian Democrats did not support the original intention, I should also commend Senator Bell for the way in which he did that job. As Senator Minchin said, we ended up with a unanimous report setting out, perhaps in more bland language than the coalition would have liked, the facts about what went wrong in this shameful process of trying to sell a government enterprise over many years. I look across at the other side of the Senate and see that there are no government members of the committee to speak on this matter today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point I stress to the Senate and to the Australian community is that this Labor government has been good at making noise and rhetoric but absolutely hopeless at managing the community's money. This classic example of endeavouring to sell an asset, going back well over four years, is an absolute indictment of people's mismanagement. The sad thing, and the evidence turned up by the committee shows this, is that the old board of the company basically indicated to the government back in November 1992 that there was a good chance of selling the company, probably for a figure greater than $100 million. The coalition has been in favour of selling ANL for many years. The community&mdash;the taxpayer&mdash;would have done well if that decision had been made then. Due to incompetence by the government, it was not made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then over $100 million&mdash;by my estimate, about $111 million&mdash;of expenses have been incurred by the government and by the taxpayer; that is, losses by ANL, plus government inquiries, consultants, et cetera. So the total of over $200 million has gone down the tube, has been lost to the taxpayer, over this period of time.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BX5">Senator GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over $200 million. The key thing is that the process of managing the sale was absolutely flawed. A good example is the way the government managed the board that was charged under the Corporations Law with managing the company. The government set up a bureaucracy, the asset sales task force, to manage the sale. The chairman of that asset sales task force changed four times during the period of the Bolitho board. There was obvious conflict between the bureaucrats and the board, and the government did nothing to sort that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bolitho board kept pointing out to the government that, under the Corporations Law, they had a duty of care to look after the company and operate the company, and that they were trustees for the assets of the company; yet the government did not understand, because most of them have not been in business. Certainly, the bureaucrats involved did not understand. They went ahead trying to organise the sale without understanding the intricacies of the shipping industry and without conferring and being honest and open with the management and board of the company. Perhaps they were under direction from the ministers. We infer from reading the evidence that the ministers responsible have messed this up. But what has happened over several years has been an absolute indictment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the Senate one classic example of the perceptions of mismanagement between the government and the board. I refer to the decision made by the government on 1 June 1993 to drop the condition of the sale of the company that there be Australian crewing and to drop it off the Australian register. The government made that decision on 1 June 1993, it now turns out, but it did not inform the board of the company until several months later. The government's agencies gave the committee advice that they believed they had given the advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer anyone interested in this to the documentary evidence set out very well in the submission by William Bolitho of 1 November this year, just recently, to the committee commenting on the Department of Finance's last submission to the committee. The documentary evidence by the previous chairman, Mr Bolitho, sets out very clearly that there were rumours around that the government had made this decision and there were hints to the company that the government had made this decision to drop the condition of Australian crewing. It turns out&mdash;and I quote page 6 of his submission&mdash;that `changes would be formally advised as soon as the unions can be locked in'. In the meantime, the government had been telling us that the board had been formally advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the chairman do? He wrote to both Minister Willis and Minister Collins on 25 August 1993 seeking clarification. What was the real situation? The board needed to know the real situation. There never was an answer; no answer from the ministers was received by the board. That is just a classic example, and there are many more. They happened all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson out of this is that this government is absolutely hopeless at managing the economy, hopeless at managing taxpayers' resources and absolutely hopeless at organising a commercial sale. As Senator Minchin said before, in the bill that is still before the chamber it looks as though we will be giving money to a company to get rid of the ANL shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wanted to make is that the decision by the government in February 1994 to change the articles of association of the company effectively meant that Minister Brereton was the chief executive of the company, because the articles were changed such that any decision by the board which effectively altered the value of the company had to have the minister's approval. That meant that the minister was the chief executive, if you like, and chairman of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen through this whole process that communication between the board and the minister was hopeless. He was not responding to correspondence or to requests for urgent decisions on what was happening with the company. So we have seen the company run downhill and taxpayers' money&mdash;by my estimate over $200 million&mdash;has been basically wasted over a four-year period because of the incompetent management of this asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very sorry for everyone involved in the ANL saga, particularly the previous chairman Bolitho and the rest of his board which were doing a good job, but also the management of the company and all the employees. They must be extremely disappointed about all this process because if the sale had been effected cleanly and neatly early on, all Australians, including all employees of ANL, I am sure would be much better off today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the committee, I too would like to make some brief remarks on the tabling of the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The proposed sale of ANL Ltd</EMPHASIS>. As Senator Margetts said during her contribution to the debate, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), at the time when Senator Gibson very sensibly proposed that this matter be a subject for inquiry by the finance and public administration committee, went quite berserk, quite mad. He was not at all impressed that the house of review, the Senate, with its very well established and world renowned committee system should dare to even have a cursory glance at the sale process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Mr Brereton and his good friend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) do not particularly like the Senate and they certainly do not like the idea of a Senate committee looking into one of their bits of executive action. During the inquiry I tried to tally up what this has really cost the Australian taxpayer. Senator Gibson has made the point today. He has had a very long and successful career in private enterprise. He is a respected company director and understands corporate finance a lot better than I do and probably better than most other senators. If he tells the Senate that the figure is in the order of $200 million, I will accept that as being a very accurate figure. In my own back of the envelope type additions on what it has probably cost the taxpayer, I estimated that it was well in excess of $100 million. But I do not say that those back of the envelope type calculations take into account all the losses and potential losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point for one reason; and Senator Margetts has made a very good point about the social impact of these sorts of decisions. Privatisation during the 1980s, particularly the early 1980s, was painted by the Australian Labor Party as some sort of international right-wing conservative conspiracy to sell off great national assets. I well remember&mdash;and Senator Minchin will remember them&mdash;the sorts of advertisements that the Labor Party ran during the 1985 South Australian election. They were very successful by the Labor Party and peddled outright misinformation about the privatisation policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the television advertisements during the 1987 federal election when the government had Graham Kennedy lampooning privatisation. They were very effective political advertisements, of course, but they bore no resemblance to the truth or the facts. If privatisation is handled properly it can achieve very important social benefits for the community but when it is handled badly the opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the sale of ANL had proceeded in an efficient, sensible and competent manner&mdash;if we had a competent minister or series of ministers in charge of the sale process&mdash;the Australian public could have been $200 million better off in terms of net assets. That is a lot of money. That amount of money can do a lot of social good for the community. Senator Margetts and I may disagree on how we would spend that $200 million. That would be a very worthy discussion and is part of the mainstream debate in any democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could use the $200 million to repatriate debt, thus reducing the ongoing interest costs to the Commonwealth accounts and reducing private taxation. We could reduce the pressure on interest rates because the Commonwealth's borrowings would be lower. As a result, we would reduce the home loan repayments of thousands of individuals&mdash;particularly those on low incomes who cannot afford the massive interest rate increases that this government's policies have placed upon them. We could use the money to assist Aboriginal communities with much needed infrastructure to allow them to have clean water and improved environmental health. There are a whole lot of things that we could do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this $200 million has effectively been flushed down the drain. This is not the only occasion on which this government has flushed hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain. It is not so long ago that I stood up in this place, as a result of another inquiry by another Senate committee and by the Auditor-General, to reveal that even on one of the government's building construction projects&mdash;the Casselden Place building in Melbourne&mdash;the government had lost in excess of $100 million. The Senate has identified $300 million which has been wasted by this government in less than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shudder to think of other examples that we have not been able to see. The Senate does a remarkable job in scrutinising this government's waste and inefficiency. I am sure that the people in the gallery today would be horrified to know that this government, by the actions of three ministers&mdash;Laurie Brereton in the case of the ANL sale and Senator Bolkus and Senator McMullan in the case of the Casselden Place building&mdash;has flushed $300 million of their money down the drain. The government takes this money from the back pockets of taxpayers and flushes it down the drain on these sorts of wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important, as my colleagues on both sides of the chamber have said, that these sorts of reports stand on the public record. Unfortunately, very few people will ever get to read this report. Unfortunately, I suspect that the media may not give it the sort of attention that it deserves. We have only to look at Labor Party administrations in states like Western Australia and South Australia. Isn't it amazing how quickly we forget? Only a couple of years ago we had this lady, Dr Carmen Lawrence, as Premier of Western Australia, sitting at the cabinet table while decisions were made that cost Western Australian taxpayers billions of dollars in waste.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time I got the gong last night, I was talking about the fact that in Australia we are competing with companies which hire labour at a very low cost and impose exploitative conditions on seafarers. I suppose we could interpret better conditions for Australian sailors as inefficiency or uncompetitive conditions. I know some people may cast doubt on the assertion that I have just made, but I note there is a bill before this house that would give shipping companies a subsidy in relation to seafarers in recognition of the competitive difficulty of having to meet basic standards in relation to treatment of workers, when competitors do not, and where competitors engage in what can be only considered as extremely exploitative practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been an issue I have raised a number of times in different contexts; that is, that international competition and deregulation is often a mechanism for increasing corporate profit by increasing the exploitation of workers. The fact that there are no international labour standards means that the most exploitative allowable standard is the one that will be most profitable, hence, most competitive&mdash;that is if you do not take the possible implications of a major marine accident into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that seafaring suffers the additional burden of essentially non-national ships being operated under flags of convenience means that shipping lines are often effectively under no obligation to anyone in relation to seafaring workers. It is not just a case of lower standards becoming the de facto international standards; it is a case of elimination of any standard at all. The imposition of standards by a nation like Australia is seen as a burden for which industry must be compensated if it is to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, standards on the actual ships are an issue. We have seen that maintaining a regime of inspection and standards for ships operating in Australian waters is a very hit-and-miss affair, and a number of rust buckets seem to operate here, and occasionally, like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, they go down in our waters. I suppose that if ANL actually tried to maintain their ships at a reasonable level this would also impair their profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: if the government cannot operate a shipping line profitably because it must assure a reasonable standard of workers' rights, crewing levels and ship maintenance, what does that say about the shipping industry and about competition and about the ships operating in our waters? Is the solution to sell ANL so that labour, safety and environmental standards can be abandoned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the problem something else? We have heard that one of the issues is that it is hard for ANL to find back loads from countries like Japan because of policies in those countries which restrict the ability of Australian ships to back load. If this is the case, or there are other reasons or barriers to effective trading, why not do something about this more directly instead of seeing this as a reason to abandon ownership of the shipping line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that Australia's negotiators, before we got down to the bottom line of the Uruguay Round of GATT, were just so keen that Australia be seen to be promoting the purest of pure free trade motives that we did not actually go in there fighting for the interests of Australian industry, the Australian environment and Australian jobs at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it peculiar indeed that Australia, surrounded by ocean, placed between the Pacific and the Indian oceans, with very direct access to Asia, the west coast of the Americas and India, and the east coast of Africa, with substantial social and political links with the South Pacific and the Indo-ASEAN area, cannot operate a shipping line. Yet English shipping companies can operate so successfully that they can buy ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this bill will pass, ANL will be disposed of, and the government and opposition will be delighted. I also know it really does not have anything to do with profitability, since both the government and the opposition want to sell off government owned businesses, whether or not they are profitable. I ask: is the supposed failure of ANL to operate profitably due to a problem with ANL or of government operated enterprises, or is it due to a failure of government to have any commitment to the idea of a shipping line as a public asset? If I could see what our government's shipping policy is, in order to be able to judge how well we are doing on it, that would be great, but I do not think anyone in the last few years has seen it or has seen any evidence that we have a shipping policy or that we actually see the benefits of having the ability to use shipping for our own transport throughout our mostly coastal communities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do the Greens (WA) feel that it is important to have a shipping line as a public asset? Shipping is important. It is certainly one of the most environmentally friendly and energy efficient means of long-haul bulk freight transport. There is no reason that is not used extensively to tie together the coastal communities of Australia, and we should recall that the huge majority of Australians live on the coast, generally in a few large communities. Instead of reliance on shipping and rail links, we see an increased reliance on and government support for the long-haul road freight. I might add that certainly overseas, even in ASEAN countries, we see a lot of reliance also on air freight, which from a greenhouse perspective is, of course, disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason shipping should remain a public asset is that it is one of the best ways to assure that an adequate and appropriate level of support for shipping can be maintained. It is a way of assuring consumer choice by assuring there is an option for shipping at a reasonable cost. Instead, we see the sell-off of Stateships and the national shipping line, which will put all decisions about shipping costs and availability firmly in the corporate board rooms in Britain and in North America and other seafaring nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate we have heard that there will be some kind of grandfathering clause, that there will be a period of grace, if you like, whereby some of the obligations to Australian public interest may be maintained. But there is no guarantee, after that time expires, that those obligations will continue&mdash;that is, on those services that P&amp;O will not be able to turn around to a profit, that they will continue at all. The Greens feel that this is inappropriate and almost certainly will lead to a situation in which shipping services will become less available or more expensive, or both, and as well will lower standards for seagoing labour, probably allowing for a reduction in the physical state of ships with a consequent increase in shipping accidents, including those which have major impacts on the marine and coastal environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all this, I am wondering whether there is the ability to reconsider the point I made in this debate yesterday&mdash;that is, the ability for us as a parliamentary process to think about asking those people who benefit most from cut-price shipping, from poorer standards of crewing or ships that have not been properly maintained&mdash;and to think about who should take that liability. That is all I have been asking for in the last couple of years, a liability regime which actually specifies who is liable to pay those costs of environmental harm about which we have no clear idea at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know why we are not doing that? The reason is that it might make us uncompetitive. In the final analysis, I am wondering whether we can step back from that all-empowering belief in international competition to see what the possible impacts would be if we lost the ability to make some standards as part of what we want to see by way of protecting our environment and our coastal communities. In conclusion, the Greens will not support this bill or the principle of selling off ANL. Australia should have a strong maritime presence and the people should, through government, have a direct role in this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are today considering the ANL Sale Bill 1995. Of course, we have only just completed debate on and consideration of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee report which, as I said earlier, shows that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has been quite incompetent in his handling of this sale. The combined cost to the taxpayer of the government's incompetent and inept handling of this sale totals around $200 million in forgone revenue to the Commonwealth. I want to make a number of other comments on issues surrounding the sale today, including where the sale is at at the moment, as this bill deals specifically with the implementation of the recommendations of the Wran board and sets into place a legislative framework to ensure that the sale goes ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, of course, does not want in any way to delay the passage of this legislation. We believe, after the ineptitude and incompetence of this government through being unsuccessful in selling ANL after four years, and having lost in the order of $200 million on this so-called privatisation, that any further delay will add insult to injury. The point I make is that Australian taxpayers and all senators should understand that one of the problems faced in this sale is an effective veto control by the maritime unions over the whole sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say at the outset that members of the Maritime Union have very legitimate interests about their conditions of employment, their job security and the future of the company that many of them have worked in for a long time. Beyond that, they should not, even though they do, have what is an effective veto right on the sale of this asset. I put it to the Senate that that veto has cost Australian taxpayers an enormous amount of money over the past four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Senate committee's consideration of ANL two or three weeks ago, I said to Kym Bills from the Department of Transport the day after the P&amp;O maritime negotiations broke down that I would have imagined that the department and the government would be considering going to the unions with a package to ensure that their interests were effectively bought out. If I remember correctly, I put it to Mr Bills that I suspected the government would negotiate a package similar to the waterfront reform package that was negotiated a couple of years before in order to try to achieve improvements in efficiencies on Australia's waterfront. Mr Bills admitted that the government was working on this option basically to ensure that the sale could proceed and to take away the Maritime Union's effective veto over the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to analyse not only the politics but also the financial implications of what the Maritime Union and the government are doing. We saw during the waterfront industry reform process that the government paid out to waterfront union members hundreds of millions of dollars. If I recall correctly, it was in the order of $450 million, but I stand to be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept was to ensure that the labour force on the waterfront was reduced and that there were efficiency gains on the waterfront in terms of work practices. We saw only last week in BIE's report on international comparisons of efficiency on waterfronts that, although Australia has had improvements on the waterfront, in the international race for productivity and waterfront efficiency Australia has actually slipped behind. Even though we have certainly made some improvements since the 1970s and early 1980s, in the 1990s we are comparatively further behind our international trade competitors than we were prior to the government spending hundreds of millions of dollars on that waterfront reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reforms that this government cannot come to grips with is competition within the labour market. This government has actually decreased competition in the labour market, particularly in the area of representation. This government has presided over a massive amalgamation of trade unions. In some industries in the past there may have been a number of unions representing workers and workers had a choice of who represented them. Now that choice has disappeared. Effectively, the Maritime Union has monopoly control over the waterfront and, in the case of ANL, monopoly control over the future of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a veto right that they should have. As I said earlier&mdash;and I am trying to strike a balance&mdash;the union and its members do have very legitimate interests in terms of their employment conditions, their employment tenure and their pay. Those things are very important to those men and their families&mdash;and I presume women in some circumstances. The Wran proposal for restructuring&mdash;option 2 I think it is&mdash;would result in somewhere between 400 and 500 of those men being made redundant. It is very important that they have some sort of assurance as to their future if that is the option the government is to take. I am sure under the P&amp;O sale option that many of them have legitimate fears for their futures. They have families to house, clothe, educate and feed. They have a legitimate interest in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other interests&mdash;that is, the future of the entity and the taxpayers' interest. It is clearly unfair for what is effectively a group of fewer than 1,000 people to hold the whole of the Australian community to ransom and, as I said in the previous debate, to effectively cost this nation in the order of $200 million. I do not blame the Maritime Union for costing us $200 million but it is a part of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may have to lever our way out of this problem with the Maritime Union to avoid a national waterfront stoppage, which is the threat that hangs over this sale process. In other words, if we do not do what the Maritime Union wants, and it is not a shareholder in the entity, it will shut down the whole country. When you think about this sale, just remember that this is the nation we live in and that this is the national parliament of a nation that has one of the worst current account deficits in the industrialised world, worse than Mexico's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to trade. We need to ensure that the goods and services we produce in this country and sell to the rest of the world get to the markets. An important part of that trade, as you, Mr Acting Deputy President McGauran, particularly as a National Party member, would understand, goes across the waterfront. A lot of the produce from regional Australia goes across the waterfront. A lot of our manufactured goods, as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), who is at the table, would understand, go across the waterfront. I am sure he understands that it is absolutely vital to keep those ports open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a threat from the Maritime Union that says, `If you go down this path against our wishes we will close down all of those ports.' We have seen the impact of that closure in previous actions. To avert that threat, the government, on the admission of Mr Bills from the Department of Transport, is looking at spending in excess of $25 million&mdash;I think that is the figure that has been bandied around. If you want to pay out 400 or 500 maritime workers, and if you start calculating at $100,000 a head, it does not take long to get up to very high multimillion dollar figures, but this of course is a further cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the real situation of where this negotiation is at the moment. It is a sad and sorry state that we have a small and potentially militant union effectively controlling the whole process here. I reiterate, for the third time, that those people have a legitimate interest in their own future and the future of their families but it is not legitimate, it is not fair, for that small handful of people, particularly the leaders of that union, to effectively hold a veto over this whole process and cost the Australian taxpayers potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have arrived at the position we are in now because of the bungling incompetence of a series of ministers who have had to handle ANL. The latest minister, Mr Brereton, has shown his incompetence, and that has been well documented in the report that was tabled this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the hearings held by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration recently, I put it to Neville Wran, the interim broad chairman of ANL, that when the minister said `you couldn't give away ANL'&mdash;although commercial people looking at the books of ANL and contemplating purchasing it would look at the fundamentals of that organisation before they decided on what price they would be prepared to pay for it&mdash;he was really saying to the trade union movement, which has an effective control over this which is well understood by the government and well understood by people who have been involved in this process, that the unions do have an effective majority share, a golden share. They have a veto over the whole process. When Mr Brereton says `you couldn't give it away', the leaders of the Maritime Union say, `You ripper!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because that union is effectively the shareholder, even though it does not own any shares and has not paid for any shares, it has a stake in this. Mr Brereton has said to the shareholder with no shares&mdash;you might call the Maritime Union a Clayton's shareholder&mdash;`You can't give it away', and the union has thought to itself, `We are not going to let you give it away. In fact, it's going to cost you a lot of money to give it away and we're going to make sure it's going to cost, it's going to hurt and it's going to be painful.' As Senator Gibson said earlier this morning, the cost so far is a couple of hundred million dollars. When we see over the next few days what the negotiations between Mr Beazley, the Maritime Union and P&amp;O throw up, we will see the next instalment on that $200 million loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the figures bandied around already are $24 million, $25 million. I suggest that when you are trying to pay off 400 or 500 maritime workers who are currently employed by ANL, the figures could be a lot higher than that. I suspect that the government will give some sort of ongoing commitment that, in the case that anyone loses their job over the next couple of years as a result of the sale, it will give some sort of ongoing redundancy package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just remember that the community has already forgotten the special tax deal that has been done for these people&mdash;a tax deal that no-one else in Australia could get. Now we are looking at spending tens of millions of dollars as a way of buying out the Maritime Union's interest in this organisation, an interest that they have not paid anything for. I do not deny that they have invested a lot of their time and their lives in being part of that organisation. I am sure many of those people, in fact the majority of them, work long and hard for ANL and that they are proud Australians and part of our great seafaring tradition. But, of course, they get remunerated very well for that work anyway. So what I am trying to say is that, quite clearly, the government will pay out an interest, however, that it has not paid any consideration for in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition of course supports the speedy passage of this bill; but it cannot go through this parliament without those comments being made. This process has given privatisation a bad name in Australia. That is sad because it can be a very effective part of a strategy to make Australia more competitive and more effective, to make the government more efficient, to ensure that taxpayers get value for their tax dollars and to ensure, in the words of Senator Margetts, that the government's ability to deliver a good social policy is enhanced as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government, particularly in the example of the ANL sale, has made a disastrous mess of the sale process. As Senator Minchin said during the debate on the report that was tabled this morning, the report and this process will provide to the world&mdash;those merchant banks and public policy makers who look at privatisation and how to do it properly&mdash;a case study in how not to do it. It is an international disgrace. It is an international case study in what not to do when you go about trying to sell a public asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an asset on which we should have had a net gain for the Commonwealth's books. The effect of the sale process will actually be a net loss of around $200 million&mdash;a brilliant achievement by a government whose epitaph will read: incompetent, inefficient and bad economic managers. And I cannot wait to see that epitaph written. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This ANL Sale Bill makes all the necessary legislative provisions to enable the final sale of the national shipping line, ANL, but it really is, as my colleagues have been saying, the culmination of an unbelievably incompetent sale process over the last four years. Of course, more than four years later we are still at the point where it is not in fact sold. That is largely a result not only of the government's incompetence but of union intransigence which my colleague Senator Campbell has detailed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is known, while we voted against this bill in the lower House because of the process used to deal with the bill, we are not opposing the bill in the Senate. But the coalition does have a number of concerns about certain provisions in the bill and, as we said this morning in discussing the report on the sale process, we are very critical of the government's incompetent handling of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the bill itself, we have expressed our considerable concern about the appropriation of up to $15 million in this bill. A very wide discretion is given to the Minister for Finance as a result of this bill. Clause 67(1) of the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may make payments totalling no more than $15 million that</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) are required to be made by sale agreement, or;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Minister believes are necessary or desirable to facilitate the transfer from an ANL body of an asset, liability, right or obligation described in Schedule B to the sale agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an extremely wide discretion for the Minister for Finance to spend $15 million. The government's second reading speech identified three elements to this Commonwealth contribution: firstly, it was to cover the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights; secondly, it was to cover expenses related to the transfer of businesses out of ANL to yet another government corporation being set up here, Retainco; and, thirdly, to provide a contingency for worse than expected losses by ANL since March. I presume we will have to call on that contingency. The bill itself does not mention those preconditions and does not limit the appropriation to those three elements. We do not have any reliable assurance that it will not be spent on other matters vaguely connected to the sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was discussed with departmental officers in our inquiry into the bill itself, the responses were inadequate. We were referred to a secret letter from the Minister for Finance to the shadow minister for privatisation containing a promise that the government would stick to the elements referred to in the second reading speech. So it is a nod and a wink as to the government promising to restrict itself in the appropriation of the $15 million. We believe that is an unsatisfactory approach to the handling of government moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also establishes the new Commonwealth entity Retainco, which is basically set up to soak up the parts of ANL which P&amp;O does not want. Again, this bill initially provided an open-ended authority to the minister for the provision of funds to Retainco. We complained about that provision in the bill. We note that the government is proposing to amend the bill to limit that appropriation to $1 million, at least in the first instance. It may well cost us more down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By establishing Retainco through this bill, the Commonwealth government is going to be stuck in the shipping business for at least another 10 years. We are led to believe that the sale of ANL will get the government out of the shipping business. That is not the case. Strictly speaking, the government is going to be stuck in this mire for about another 10 years and, as we know from this bill, with potential liabilities of $183 million, having already lost&mdash;as my colleagues have been saying&mdash;$200 million through this whole process. We will sell ANL but still have in taxpayers' hands a potential liability of $183 million. All we can get from the government is a hope that Retainco will be `cash neutral to the Commonwealth over the long-term' which, coming from this government, is not much of an assurance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale could actually cost the taxpayer. I said this morning that Minister Brereton was wrong to say you could not give ANL away. What is likely to occur is that we will be giving ANL away, but it may be even worse than that. The former ANL chairman, the well rewarded Neville Wran, in evidence to our committee on 20 October said that the maximum net proceeds from this sale would be $4.9 million. He then put on the record what the government failed to do&mdash;the worst case scenario&mdash;that it might result in a net cost to the government, to the taxpayer, of $12.1 million. In other words, it could cost the taxpayer $12.1 million simply to sell ANL to P&amp;O, which is a ludicrous, farcical situation and encapsulates what a nonsense this wholesale process has been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. My colleague Senator Campbell has pointed out the costs of potential redundancy packages that may be involved. The $12.1 million to get it off our hands may be just the start of yet another downward spiral for the taxpayer. As has been said repeatedly this morning, it has taken us four long years just to get to this point. The sale was announced by the government with great fanfare in the 1991 budget. Four years later, we still have it. ANL has cost us a fortune, and the sale is still not certain. As we said about the report, it is a testament to the unbelievable incompetence of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell said, three state Liberal governments in Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia have been responsible for cleaning up the mess left by their previous state Labor governments. They have had to dispose of much bigger and much more complex assets in far less time simply to ensure that their states do not go bankrupt as a result of the incompetence of state Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state of South Australia, the state Liberal government inherited the State Bank, which had lost $3,000 million over the course of the Labor government. The state Liberal government managed to sell that in less than 12 months for what turned out to be a very good price. It was a much more complicated and difficult process than a small shipping line, which this government cannot sell in four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole ANL process is nothing more than a sorry saga of government confusion over its objectives; a failure to communicate those objectives; an appalling treatment of the former board, as I said this morning; an ineffective and inefficient sale process; and, as my colleague Senator Campbell has pointed to, union blackmail and intransigence. The report we had this morning on this whole process is a classic example of how not to sell a government business. It has been a disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money. For me and my colleagues on this side, it is a demonstration of why governments should avoid involvement in businesses like shipping in the first place. I know that the representatives of the Department of Finance are sympathetic to that view. This is really all about why you should never get involved in business enterprises from a government point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting report on this issue in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 9 November really illustrates what we are talking about. That report, headed `ANL "hamstrung by interference"', says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Line had been hamstrung by years of government interference and the maintenance of Australian Public Service wages and conditions for ANL staff, according to Victorian academic Keith Trace.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact that ANL management and employees had been subject to public-service conditions had impeded the line's operational flexibility and made it difficult to maintain an appropriate structure for senior management.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite an independent professor is summing up the problems of a government being involved in a commercial enterprise like shipping. Inevitably it gets caught up in a bureaucratic approach and the politicisation of its operations, as was pointed out by former chairman Mr Bolitho, where the government maintains quite uneconomic operations within the  company for purely political reasons. Not only is this a testament to how not to sell a government business; it is a testament to why government should never get involved in these businesses in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Price Waterhouse-Salomon Bros said in their 1994 report on ANL:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANL has represented a poor investment over the past 12 years for the Commonwealth. Commonwealth injected $160.5m in equity between 1983 &amp; 1995, yet received only $20.7m in Dividends between 1983 and present day.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an appalling return on its investment. As we have been saying this morning, the real indictment of the government is the sale process. It finally made the right decision in 1991 to sell the company. That was the right decision. Ever since then, it has acted wrongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is now clear and as the department, if not the government, admits, the board should have been restructured in 1991. A board should have been appointed with the brief to sell the business. Instead, we have had this very long drawn out sale process with very confused objectives. We have had government gutlessness, which is all it can be called, in the face of a militant union, and there has been very poor treatment of the former board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office report makes fascinating reading. Its terms of reference on the sale were very limited. It was very hamstrung on what it could say, particularly about government action. It independently exposed some of the very big deficiencies in the whole process. I summarise its findings. The Audit Office found that the old board was effectively denied natural justice over its sacking by the minister, Laurie Brereton, in August 1984; that the old board should have been given the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Bros report; that there was inadequate documentation of departmental advice to ministers relating to that report; that the government sale objectives were unclear; that there was inadequate cooperation between the task force on asset sales, the transport department and ANL; that Minister Brereton's extraordinary statement of 22 August could have an eventual effect on the value of ANL, on the day to day operations of ANL and on the morale of the work force. The majority of the Senate committee which reported today has endorsed that finding and commented critically on Minister Brereton's extraordinarily irresponsible statement in August last year. Given the constraints that applied to the Audit Office, that report is damning of the government about the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton's actions and his statements on the sale have been absolutely hopeless. He is the great walking disaster of this government. I am amazed that they continue to tolerate him as a minister. He was drummed out of New South Wales politics after almost single handedly destroying the Wran government. Now he is almost single handedly destroying the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has overseen a disaster in industrial relations. We are now seeing the ramifications of that. He has been a disaster in relation to Sydney airport and in relation to ANL. His statement that you could not give away ANL must go down as one of the most irresponsible statements ever made by a minister. He has been proven wrong, because the government is giving it away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, in its editorial of 23 October, summed up the situation independently. These are not our words. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> said about the whole process:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To say the Government's handling of the sale of ANL has been clumsy and inadequate would be an understatement. Not to put too fine a point on it, the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, thoroughly misjudged the sensitivities involved and the Government has been made to live with the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of what the Government's final decision will be, Minister Brereton's off-the-cuff remark that the Government could not give the national shipping line away, will always overshadow the outcome and raise serious doubts about whether Australian taxpayers were allowed to get the best possible return from a national asset.</PARA>
<PARA>That sums up the disaster that Minister Brereton has presided over. That statement by Minister Brereton, which presumably had some machiavellian political motive to do with the Labor Party and the trade unions, was a response to the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Bros report. That report, as the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee discovered in its inquiry, cost the taxpayers half a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government effectively rejected that report. It recommended an informal liquidation of the company. The government rejected that, sacked the board, put Mr Wran in place and gave him and his fellows members of the board $816,000 to restructure the company. He got $300,000 for his part-time job. I noted this morning that Mr Bolitho, who spent 10 years of his life trying to build up this asset, got a paltry $40,000 a year. Mr Wran earned as much in one year as Mr Bolitho probably earned in his 10 years of chairmanship of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wran board recommended the sale of the company, not a restructure, and that a restructure would have been a disaster. For the last 12 months we have had this incredible saga of differing objectives in relation to the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by noting with sadness that the whole process of selling this government asset has been a farce. As my colleague said, it is a tragedy because it could be used by some to give privatisation a bad name. What it really says is that the government should not have got into this business in the first place but that when it decided to sell the asset it should have sold it, instead of spending four years doing what this government has done and made a farce of the whole process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this debate on the sale of the Australian National Line. The sale is not without significance, at least in an historical aspect. The Commonwealth government first became a shipowner in interesting circumstances. That was during World War I when the Commonwealth seized and retained a number of enemy vessels. In 1916 it established the Australian Government Line. That is the history of ANL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then the world has moved on, and privatisation has become a buzz word. The opposition supports the government's privatisation program in principle and has done so over the last 13 years of this government's reign. But, as Senator Campbell rightly pointed out, this government happens to give privatisation a very bad name indeed. Privatisation is a very simple concept; that is, not in all circumstances but in most circumstances, the private sector can run an enterprise better than the public sector. And that has been proven over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revenue gained through privatisation is a benefit to the taxpayers. It can be utilised to reduce long-term debt and government can be free to get on to administer what it does best. So if that asset is sold efficiently, the Australian public obviously are better off. But we have a very sorry tale in asset sales by this government. They have not used properly what they have managed to sell. They have not used it to retire national debt and long-term debt. Rather, they have used it on current expenditure, feeding it into their budget deficit. As a result, the government have not once reached their target for asset sales, bar a successful partial float of the Commonwealth Bank. That is about the only successful sale they have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1991 through to 1994-95, in each budget announcement they have never reached their target. In 1991 they budgeted for some $1 billion worth of asset sales and they reached a target of $162 million. In 1991-92, they budgeted for some $625 million worth of asset sales and they reached half that figure. In the 1992-93 budget, they budgeted for $1.6 billion worth of asset sales and they reached only $800 million. In 1993-94, a very ambitious $2.4 billion worth of asset sales were budgeted for, and they did not reach that figure either. We know only too well that the sale of Qantas appeared on each one of those budget estimates. It has only recently been sold. It took them four long years to sell off Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But nothing really matches the fiasco that we have in the sale of the Australian National Line. And a fiasco it is. Events in this ongoing saga have even surpassed the legislation we have before us today. We are told in the second reading speech by the Minister for Finance, Mr Kim Beazley&mdash;and I quote from his second reading speech to give an indication of how events have even surpassed the bill we have before the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANL Sale Bill makes the necessary legislative provision to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL Limited although agreement has been reached under which the finalisation of the sale to P&amp;O Australia has been deferred until 31 October 1995&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we are in mid-November. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order for the option of a sale to P&amp;O to be quickly carried out at the completion of negotiations between unions and P&amp;O, it will be necessary for the ANL Sale Bill to be passed by both Houses of Parliament by the end of October . . . Any further delay creates uncertainty, with the risk of consequent damage to ANL's market share in its various businesses.</PARA>
<PARA>Even today the truth is that no such agreement stands. We are still in a very uncertain stage of the sale of ANL. It is always potentially on the collapse list. The prospects of sale, I would say, are still unlikely before the next election or this side of Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the first announcement of the sale of ANL in the 1991 budget, we still have uncertainty and doubt about the sale of ANL. I am told that, each day the ANL sale is held up ticks by, it is costing taxpayers some $2 million. The Minister for Transport, Mr Laurie Brereton, must take the greater proportion of responsibility and blame for the problems that have surrounded this sale of the National Line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have pointed out, back on 22 August 1994, some 12 months ago, the minister made those now immortal comments of managerial inexcellence when he said, `You couldn't give it away.' Subsequently, he pulled the ANL off the sale list. Such damage was believed to have been done to the sale price by this comment that it was found necessary for the Senate finance and public administration references committee to establish an inquiry into whether the proposed sale of ANL was conducted with the prudence, integrity, skills and propriety necessary to protect its value. How could it be? The conclusions are obvious with the minister making those sorts of comments. The report was tabled today by Senator Bell. The majority view was the obvious, that those comments did do damage to the sale value of ANL. I quote from page 9 of that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the view of the majority of members, the statements carried the potential to have a negative influence on interests of the Commonwealth and they question the prudence of the Minister's conduct in making statements which were potentially damaging to the sale process without providing the full documentation relied upon to support those statements.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the former chairman of the line, Mr Bolitho, who told that committee that the minister, by his comments, had destroyed a public asset worth some $100 million and, as he said, for no reason other than political expediency. Given this minister's history in political expediency you would have to attach a great deal of truth to Mr Bolitho's comments. It is not just a Senate committee or a former chairman of ANL who have pointed the bone at the minister; indeed, the Audit Office back on 6 December 1994 in a report tabled in the Senate said it is `clear that the actions and statements of those involved in the sale process can influence the perceptions of the market to the point where the seller will be perceived as a "distressed seller"'. That is the full effect of the minister's comments. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is most likely to result in lower price for the asset. For this reason it is important that the public officials involved in the sale of Commonwealth assets at all times act with discretion in order not to prejudice the Commonwealth's position.</PARA>
<PARA>That report back in December 1994 sparked another report by the Auditor-General, under instruction from the Senate, and which was handed down in August this year. It was another report on the debacle of the ANL sale. Even after this very tortured path that the minister took when he sacked the ANL board and its chairman Mr Bolitho, took back control of ANL, appointed his two mates Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull and relaunched the sale of ANL, you would have to say today that there is still no great certainty that this sale is not going to hit the rocks again. As I said before, as each day ticks by and the unions hold off giving their full agreement and confirmation to this sale, the taxpayer loses $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the same union that is out on strike at the moment on another matter. They have a lot on their plate, this maritime workers union. As soon as they have finished their strike against CRA and the industrial relations system in this country, they will probably go out again on the sale of ANL. So this union really is holding the country to ransom. They have that many strikes banked up they cannot get out quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has found himself captive to this union, not just on industrial relations but on this matter too, with regard to privatisation. The union has been a party to this debacle. It has always been the desired option of the union not to sell ANL but to restructure it. In fact, it had some idea at one stage that it would buy shares in ANL. The shares that the union was going to buy in ANL, in the hope of keeping it propped up, were going to be paid for out of the workers' superannuation fund. That is how it was going to fund this idiotic purchase of ANL shares, but even the union dropped that idea. The imprimatur for the union's purchase of shares in ANL had the nod from the ACTU. All the blocking and delaying tactics by the union have had the imprimatur of the ACTU and Mr Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1994 the union ran a crippling strike in protest against the ANL sale which shut down ports across Australia. The strike cost some $55 million. It was a crude but successful attempt to pressure the federal government into committing itself financially to the very wrecked Australian National Line. Since then the maritime union has put up every hurdle and every delaying tactic possible in an attempt to block this sale. To date the union has been successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects the shambles that surrounds the ANL sale encapsulates the government's problems in completing the very necessary micro-economic reform required for an efficient and competitive economy. We have a union movement that is resistant to change and a government run by incompetent and expedient ministers. All this is at the cost of Australia's competitiveness. That is borne out in a recent report by the government's own Bureau of Industry Economics entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International benchmarking overview 1995</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was mentioned some time in debate yesterday that the government has already put the spin doctors on this report. The Bureau of Industry Economics is a government body reporting directly to the government. However, the government does not want to hear the truth. The report reveals that the delivery of many vital business inputs&mdash;including telecommunications, electricity and rail freight&mdash;is marred by low labour productivity. It warns that Australia risks falling even further behind the rest of the world if the government allows the pace of reform to slow. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now is certainly not the time for reform fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA>The BIE report says that the waterfront and coastal shipping remains one of the key problem areas for Australia&mdash;and that is no surprise&mdash;with very long and variable unloading times and high prices characterising the movement of containers through our ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to say that the rate of reform in coastal shipping has slowed in the past few years, with Australia's total vessel costs higher than the corresponding costs in all comparable countries except the United States and Japan. This was mainly due to manning costs which are some five to 17 per cent greater than the average costs of comparable countries, and three times greater than the lowest costs in Germany. Relatively high fuel prices, repair and maintenance costs and other operating costs, such as dry-docking, insurance and storage also make the industry struggle internationally and competitively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reason why ANL ships spend more time in dry dock than those of its rivals. Australian crews will not carry out maintenance, such as overhauling engines and scraping rust, while the ship is operating. It is estimated that, because of this, the direct and indirect costs run at some $1 million per year for each ANL ship. This is just one example of how inflexible work practices have wounded the national shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that consistent maritime strikes and low labour productivity compared with our competition are the major factors why it is now necessary to sell ANL. I accept that foreign owned lines run conditions that we would never concede to&mdash;the ships of shame&mdash;and where many of the workers are exploited. However, there is great room for improvement from the Australian work force. The Senate can only hope that this bill is of value in progressing the eventual sale of ANL and that, when the minister is less distracted on matters of industrial relations, which are now wreaking havoc in the economy, and when the Maritime Union returns to work after its five-day strike against Comalco, both parties will turn their minds back to the sale of ANL so that we have a successful conclusion to this fiasco. </PARA>

This is a bill from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) for arrangements going to the sale of the Australian National Line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, the opposition coalition have indicated that they will support the passage of this legislation. The Australian Democrats and the Western Australian Greens have indicated that they will oppose this legislation. Given that the government will vote for its own legislation, the bill will pass this chamber with the dissent of the Democrats and the Greens. In responding to the debate, I am mindful that this bill will carry and become law, and thus enable the Australian national shipping line to go ahead and be sold. That is a desirable outcome for reasons that I will go to in just a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A number of senators have participated in this debate. I thank all of those who have made a contribution. ANL is, of course, a shipping line. Things that go to sea, dock alongside wharves and involve labour on board ships or on the wharf attract a great deal of controversy in this chamber. We have found that the vehicle of a debate about a sale bill has become an opportunity for a number of senators to express their views about matters shipping and waterfront&mdash;not all of those views being directly pointed at this bill. Nonetheless, it has provided a platform to make speeches about those things. It is not my intention to deal with those speeches in any detail, because they are beside the point. I think it is better to stick to the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill before the chamber has several key features. The main ones being that it includes savings and transitional provisions in respect of employee entitlements, similar to those made in respect of the previous major asset sales. It provides for the transfer of ANL assets, liabilities, rights and obligations that are not being purchased by P&amp;O to the Commonwealth or a nominated wholly owned company&mdash;in this case, a company called RetainCo for the purposes of this bill. It provides a statutory government guarantee over the obligations of that company, RetainCo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes provision for the protection of national interest issues arising from the sale of ANL and for the retention by the Commonwealth of a golden share in ANL. It enables the Commonwealth to enforce the rights relating to national interests by seeking injunctions from the Federal Court. It appropriates funds up to $15 million that may be necessary to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the sale contract or to cover the expenses of transferring the assets and liabilities out of ANL. It appropriates any funds required in respect of working capital for the current financial year for RetainCo, or any former ANL companies transferred to the Commonwealth. I note that the government has agreed to move an amendment here, capping expenditure under this appropriation at $1 million. The bill will repeal automatically with effect from 1 January 1996 if the draft sale contract with P&amp;O cannot be executed by 31 December this year. There is a number of other provisions in this bill. They are consequential to those objectives, and I will not reiterate them now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this bill, as I have said, a number of the arguments have been not to the point of the bill. If I can summarise the opposition arguments about this bill, they are easily categorised as, firstly, the government here is incompetent; secondly, the unions assert too much influence; and, thirdly, ANL has been mismanaged and mishandled. In summary, I think that is what the opposition has said of this bill and of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just deal with that very briefly. There is a mood in the air that Australia may have an election soon. One could say that if the Labor Party parted the Red Sea and marched its troops across, the opposition would attack the Labor Party for being incompetent, for being in the hands of the unions that represent those troops and for having mishandled the whole manoeuvre, because there have been reports that people have walked on water, so why did they go to the whole effort of parting the Red Sea when they should have, if they were competent, walked across the top of it? The political debate is just going a bit crazy, so allegations of incompetence are thrown about willy-nilly. I do not intend to dignify those allegations any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens and the Australian Democrats have attacked this legislation from a slightly different view. They argue, and the government acknowledges the strength of this point, that Australia as a massive island continent requires a national shipping line. They go on from that point to argue, therefore, that this shipping line, owned by the Australian people, should not be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree, and the government has the view, that Australia as an island continent requires the services of a national shipping line. The difference here is: who should own it&mdash;the government or private enterprise? We take the view that in these circumstances, where there is a private company interested in buying it, it can be appropriately sold with the government maintaining a golden share in that shipping line&mdash;ensuring that it is crewed by Australians, that it sails under an Australian flag and that its headquarters are in Australia&mdash;and the government will utilise that golden share to enforce those conditions. In those circumstances, we think it is appropriate to transfer the ownership from public assets to a privately owned operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just use this occasion to respectfully point out the logical flaw in the argument of the Democrats and the Greens that yes, of course, we do need to service our coast, but who owns the vehicle that does that is another matter. That does not seem to have been addressed adequately in any of the criticism flowing from the crossbenches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other thing, which normally I would not get into. The Bureau of Industry Economics, in its most recent report on micro-economic reform, has been mentioned by a number of speakers. The Bureau of Industry Economics is a bureau within my portfolio. I am here, of course, in this debate representing the Minister for Finance and not my own portfolio, but my own portfolio of Industry, Science and Technology has within it the Bureau of Industry Economics. It reports to me, and it tabled last week a report card on Australia's progress to micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, of course, familiar with that report. It has been massively abused and misrepresented. Some of that misrepresentation occurred in this debate here in this chamber again today. One ought to always look at these reports in context. This report sought to compare Australia's performance in various elements of its transport and services economy with the very best performed economies in the world. For example, in telecommunications, when the bureau looked around the world to find the cheapest telecommunications company, it compared Telecom to Iceland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the economic commentators said, `Interesting comparison'. But only 250,000 people live in Iceland. Most of them live in Reykjavik, the capital, and the others live down the peninsula. To set up a telecommunications system for them does not adequately compare with setting up an Australian telecommunications system for 18 million people on this massive continent. The cost comparisons are not as simple but, certainly, Iceland has the most efficient telecommunications system. So we were comparing Australia with Iceland in that study. I might say that on telecommunications we came out of that study extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject here is shipping, and the waterfront has been dragged into it. Interestingly, those who have criticised Australia's waterfront performance in this debate neglected to mention that, in terms of bulk loading, the BIE study found that we have the most efficient waterfront in the world. If the waterfront was an Olympic Games event, Australia would have won the gold medal in bulk loading. No-one bothered to mention that in this debate; they only focused on the other area and drew the conclusion that the sky is about to fall in and that this country is doomed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you are going to venture into this field and pretend that you are doing it logically and comprehensively, do it that way, otherwise be open to the allegation I now make, that there is selective quoting in order to make a case rather than a proper analysis of what are the circumstances. It is how you actually read this report. Certainly it found that progress on the waterfront on container movements had not matched earlier achievements. As someone said on the other side, `And therefore the whole thing has been a waste of time'. But it did not find that. When you take the whole of the period in which we as a government began the process of reforming the Australian waterfront and making it more efficient&mdash;no previous government had done so; when the opposition was in government it did not do it&mdash;then you see that considerable efficiency gains have been achieved over that whole time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, from the report, there is a need to energise that further. But, when we look again at what is happening on the waterfront itself, we see deals being done for a massive reinjection of capital investment to improve the technology. It is not a matter of people working harder; it is a matter of people using the cranage and the massive technology needed to shift containers. If you have not got best technology you are not best efficient. The new capital investment coming onto the waterfront will lift the efficiency of Australia's waterfront rates, and they are the logical conclusions from the waterfront report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main provisions of the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill involve: a new mechanism to allow the allocation of commercial television broadcasting licences in solus markets; an improved mechanism to allow the allocation of commercial radio broadcasting licences in solus markets, particularly when licence area plans have not yet been written; changes to the pay television anti-siphoning provisions for significant televised events; clarification of the nature of cooperation allowed between satellite licensees A and B under their exemptions from the ownership and control restrictions of the principal act; and new 15 per cent deemed control provisions&mdash;in layman's terms the `Get Packer' amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal firstly with the first part which is relatively uncontroversial. The coalition supports the substance of the provisions for the allocation of commercial television broadcasting licences in solus markets. As far as commercial radio licences are concerned, under the old section 39 the ABA was required to allocate an additional commercial radio broadcasting licence to any solus incumbent, provided that there were at least two spare commercial radio licences. Legal advice to the ABA was that this condition could not be satisfied without the completion of a licence area plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delays in the preparation of licence area plans in most areas of Australia have meant that no additional licences have been allocated to solus radio operators anywhere in the country. These amendments replace the old section 39. Apart from minor clarification of the circumstances under which an additional licence may be allocated, there are several significant changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the ABA may not allocate an additional licence unless it is of the opinion that a suitable broadcasting spectrum is available. While existing frequency allotment plans lapse and ministerial reservations must be taken into account, the ABA may form such an opinion in their absence. These changes will allow the ABA to allocate additional commercial radio licences immediately rather than wait for the completion of a lap in a licence area. The ABA must attach technical conditions to an additional licence in the absence of a lap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the ABA may not allocate an additional licence in a licence area when there is excessive overlap between the area and a different service licensed in another area. The test for excessive overlap is being changed to make it easier for smaller commercial broadcasters to get an additional licence where their service area is substantially overlapped by another solus operator who is entitled to a second channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, to encourage early applications for additional licences, prospective licensees will have 60 days after the proclamation of the amendments in which to lodge an application for an additional licence. Special provision is made for incumbent licensees to make an application later if they subsequently become eligible for an additional licence. Applications may also be lodged in anticipation of changes in relevant industry conditions which might make an incumbent licensee eligible for an additional licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are long overdue. Since 1984, the government has been promising supplementary licences in solus markets. Now with an election in a few months the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, has undergone a death bed conversion and said that he will fix the problem by allocating additional commercial licences and, at the same time, allow the ABA to call for additional licence applications. The ABA process will continue. In theory, once they have completed an area they release the plan and they are able to call for supplementary licences, but to date only one licence has been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has long advocated these changes and whether it was because of obtuseness or ignorance, or a combination of both, the minister was simply blind to those calls until he attended the annual conference of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters several months ago at which time he was taken out into the backroom and basically bashed up. The industry made it clear to him that it was simply not prepared to stand by and see a process continue probably analogous to the pay television saga. That is, when we were in government in 1980 we gave the green light to pay television and 15 years later it is finally coming to fruition. The radio industry saw shades of a repetition of that fiasco, given that Michael Duffy had been talking about granting supplementary licences as long ago as 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is gratifying that the minister was persuaded to see reason, but it is disappointing that he could not have come to this conclusion without that political pressure being applied. Perhaps he was not getting any directions from his master's voice but the fact remains that at long last we have changes that are in the interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one area that I am aware of in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland where there can in fact be slight problems because of this necessary overlap provision. Having looked carefully at both the proposal and the counter-proposal which would follow from opposing this amendment, if we were to oppose it listeners in some areas would get one licence service, some would get two and some would get three depending on their area. Under this provision listeners will get at least two in every area. That ultimately is a more satisfactory and fairer outcome. In those circumstances, whilst I can understand the concerns that have been expressed, and in the interests of accommodating the consumers as much as possible, these amendments will do their best to achieve that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the anti-siphoning provisions are concerned let me simply say that this has been yet another farce. I can recall that more than 12 months ago after a very exciting three-test cricket series in Pakistan it was suggested that the series should be taken off the anti-siphoning list. After stalling for some months, the minister finally said he would refer the matter to the ABA. The end result was that we did not even get a decision on whether that ought to be made available to the pay television operators for something like 12 months after the event. That is an absolute absurdity. Who knows what was going on in Mr Lee's head, but once again we finally have legislation that will at least address one aspect of the anti-siphoning legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can certainly understand why the Australian Democrats have moved their amendment to say that after a period of 24 hours has elapsed it ought to be then automatically available subject to the minister's gazetting and presumably explaining why there is a need for a further delay. The government's proposal is that after a period of seven days the program ought to be available. As I understand it, the principle reason for that delay is that some events go on over a period of days&mdash;Wimbledon goes for about two weeks&mdash;and, therefore, some greater period of time is needed to ensure that you are not actually running day one when day seven is in play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a clear-cut solution, and I do not know that seven days is the most satisfactory outcome either. But at this stage we would take the view that at least it is addressing some of the complications that will arise from successive programming of a single event. In those circumstances we will support that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other provisions that I do not want to spend a great deal of time on. The cross media provisions between satellite licensees generally make sense. So I will come to what really is the vice of this legislation&mdash;that is, the notorious `Get Packer' amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those amendments typify all that is wrong in the Labor Party's approach to media policy. I do not for one moment believe they are the work of Michael Lee who is essentially a political doormat to the dominion of his master's voice. The architect of these disgracefully grubby changes is the man who has driven Labor's media for mates policy over the last decade&mdash;the man who uses media policy as an instrument of patronage to punish his enemies and reward his mates. This is a classic example of the politics of vengeance. Paul Keating has consistently corrupted public policy principles in this area and this is no exception. It was only yesterday that we saw him stoop to new depths of political amorality in simply ignoring very explicit findings that one of his ministers had lied. But I do not think any of us were surprised that his standards led him in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change is simply another example of using the media rules as not only a personal plaything but as a political weapon to bludgeon the proprietors, reward the good and punish the bad. We now have a situation where the Prime Minister is simply pursuing a vendetta against one media baron whilst desperately trying to not upset another. Of course, they have both made it clear what they really think of the government's performance in recent years; one having said that there was a time for a changing of the guard, the other in effect saying that the state of the economy was a disgrace. They have both put very significant nails in the Prime Minister's coffin but, once again, we have differential treatment when it comes to changes to media rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cross-media rules were designed to ensure plurality and diversity. But these proposals do nothing; they simply impose an arbitrary 15 per cent irrespective of the notion of control&mdash;in fact, they ignore that. So you have this nonsensical situation where Prime television is in excess of 15 per cent as far as Sunshine is concerned; Seven is clearly in control because it has in excess of 50 per cent; and yet Prime would be deemed to be in control under these arrangements. No discretion, simply two quite conflicting commercial interests, yet both regarded as being in control&mdash;an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, when the ABA made its findings in relation to Packer not being in control of the Fairfax organisation, they did that on the basis that Conrad Black was in control, as everyone in the country knows, as Mr Black himself has asserted many times, and that was the fact. The government was clearly hoping that the ABA would do its dirty work for it and make an adverse finding. When it did not, the sky fell in and we had the politics of retribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at recent statements on this matter to realise how farcical and totally insincere these amendments are. In August 1994, Michael Lee was saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's cross-media ownership rules are working well.</PARA>
<PARA>February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm quite happy to leave the responsibility with the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA>On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on 20 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Control is the key. Control is fundamental to promoting diversity and under the act control is the trip-wire. In some ways it doesn't matter whether somebody's above or below the 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely right: what is the relevance of 15 per cent? It is an entirely arbitrary and capricious concept. It is meaningless, other than throwing a dart at the dartboard, if you are not concerned about control. And cross-media rules are all about trying to ensure that people are not in a position to control more than one market. So this is simply an abdication of all of the underlying principles of cross-media rules and transparently an example of where politics has overtaken policy once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that Michael Lee was utterly humiliated on all this. Not only having said that the rules worked well, he was aware of his master's voice back in late 1994 on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't even try to be confident about resisting the shift of these technologies. I mean, it's not going to be very long. Here's News Ltd with Star TV. What are you going to do about that? Poke your tongue at it? Throw a bill up in the air? Table a motion in the House?</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Keating was quite relaxed about the need for an overhaul of the existing cross-media rules and, indeed, Michael Lee himself was promising that earlier this year. We are told there will be a review this year. Of course, there should be and that review ought to precede any of these changes. These are not even bandaid changes; these are simply mogul specific changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee said back in February this year that it was up to the ABA alone, that the government was not going to intervene; they would make the decision. They did, but they made the wrong decision as far as Mr Keating was concerned. That is why we now have this transparently political attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high watermark of hypocrisy in this whole debate arises when one realises that two press releases were put out by Michael Lee, one on 3 May and another on 27 June, in which it was said that the 15 per cent fixed ownership limit would be applied to the control provisions in the act. It was also said that company interests currently caught by the act would be widened to include interests that are linked to company performance and that this would also apply to future foreign interests. There would be grandfathering arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all of that, those provisions are not in this bill. They have simply been put to one side. A spokesman for Mr Lee said on 25 October last month that the amendments to close off the debenture loophole were proving hard to draft. I do not think there is anyone in the country who believes that proposition. There is nothing difficult about this proposal. It is simply being deferred for political reasons. Obviously it would accommodate the concerns of CanWest which, whilst accepting the grandfathering rule in principle, is concerned that any subsequent changes in the structure of Channel Ten would mean that it might lose the protection of grandfathering. But to justify omitting something that the government solemnly said would be in this legislation on the transparently unbelievable basis that the provisions were too hard to draft simply exposes this whole legislation for what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told, if you read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning-Herald</EMPHASIS>, that the minister still has plans to have the subsequent amendments passed before parliament rises. We only have two further weeks. There is no indication on any running sheets I have seen that we are going to get any such amendments. I would say it is London to a brick on&mdash;and if Senator Collins wants to have a bet on that, I would be more than happy to accommodate him&mdash;that there is nothing more certain than that we will not see those amendments before the parliament rises. In other words, we will be left with a stark naked proposition simply directed at one media proprietor, conceived in vengeance, as I heard Don Watson say the other day in another context, designed entirely to overturn not only the ABA but the whole concept of control, the whole principles upon which cross-media rules have been based in this country for almost a decade and entirely in the context of remarks which Mr Packer made some months ago. Mr Packer having had the gall to say that John Howard would make a good Prime Minister, Paul Keating has been hell-bent ever since on exacting revenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to go into all the examples that are on the public record of the way in which the Prime Minister treats media policy, or what Max Sutch said about interviews with him, how his conversation is littered with references to `our crowd' and `getting even', or what Shawcross said in his magnificent biography of Murdoch about how Keating deliberately went over to the ski slopes of Aspen to inform Mr Murdoch and, indeed, separately Mr Packer of changes that he had in mind. But he did not tell the Herald and Weekly Times about those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the ABA would not do his dirty work, the man who invented cross-media rules to get his enemies in Flinders St is now changing those rules to get his enemies in Park St. Less than three months after Mr Lee claimed the cross-media rules did not need modifying for two or three years, and said that control was much more important than any number of shares that someone might own, suddenly we have the government up to its usual tricks of putting personalities and political paybacks before the national interest, not prepared to try to fix a third world media ownership regime that was fast becoming the laughing stock of the region but simply pursuing a political vendetta for the obvious motivations that have always driven the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will not be supporting these changes. We make it perfectly clear that if the government is in any shape or form serious, which is it is not, about having an effective cross-media regime then it ought to do what the act requires and what they themselves have promised, and that is commence the review under the Broadcasting Services Act, take account of what is happening around the world not only in the UK right now in terms of share of voice and cross-media exchange rates but legislation which has recently gone through the US Congress and which has liberalised these rules in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sensible and proper course to take. If you are interested in governance, you go through those processes and you do your best to come up with public policy solutions. This is simply yet another classic example of the way in which Paul Keating plays the game. It has nothing to do with Michael Lee. Michael Lee is, as always, a mere cipher in this portfolio. This is the Prime Minister at his worst, doing what is now second nature to him. He is using the media laws for naked political purposes, and we will not wear it.</PARA>

I will briefly address the concluding remarks of Senator Alston. I hate to destroy a terrific conspiracy theory, but I am afraid that I am going to have to blow a hole in the one that has just been advanced by Senator Alston.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments on the 15 per cent ownership rule are not anti-mogul or to get Mr Packer or anything else. They also have nothing whatever to do with any view that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may or may not have on this issue. They in fact have everything to do with the position put to cabinet by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee. As someone who was actually there listening to the arguments at the time, I can, in fact, give you that from the horse's mouth. This conspiracy theory has of course been given a great run by Senator Alston, but it is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that it is a nonsense is actually on the public record. The facts, rather than a conspiracy theory, are a matter of public record. The ABA itself advised the minister earlier this year that the current ownership and control rules have been perceived as causing a certain degree of public uncertainty. The reason for that public uncertainty, of course, is obvious. The provisions in the act for anything over 15 per cent relate to a matter of judgment. Someone else in the ABA would have to decide whether control was exercised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Broadcasting Authority, not Mr Keating or anyone else, pointed out to the minister that this was causing a certain degree of public uncertainty. The ABA also advised the minister that there had been a possible lessening of public confidence in the predicability of those rules, partly because the ABA is required to exercise judgment in determining control, as I have just said, and partly because investors have been able to structure substantial holdings of quasi-equity interests in Australian media companies so as to comply with the control provisions of this act. The establishment of a 15 per cent fixed limit will overcome these difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just needs to be firmly placed on the record that the conspiracy theory is a load of opposition nonsense. The ABA's advice to the minister is in fact well known. It is directly on the basis of that independent and expert advice from the Australian Broadcasting Authority to this government. In order to restore that confidence and predictability in the 15 per cent rules, which of course already are the threshold, and in order to stop the quasi-equity provisions from circumventing that rule&mdash;based directly on that advice from the ABA&mdash;the minister in fact proposed these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear Senator Alston talk about the predictability and certainty in respect of broadcasting. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record and the press record will show, Senator Alston stands alone in adopting more positions on media policy than a white ball in a snooker game. You have only to look at all the things Senator Alston has said on that question of pay TV, which he touched upon, to see that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not mind. It needs to be firmly stated that this conspiracy theory that Senator Alston advanced about the 15 per cent is a nonsense. The 15 per cent rules are before the Senate because of very direct advice provided by the ABA to Minister Lee about the perceived uncertainty, lack of confidence by the public in these rules and the quasi-equity mechanisms that were being used to circumvent them. That is why the amendment is before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Alston's query about the further amendments in respect of this matter, I am advised that it is the government's intention to have these introduced into the parliament in the communications and tourism legislation which will come before the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill it has been subject to scrutiny by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communication and the Arts Legislation Committee. The committee's report, which was tabled in the Senate on 2 March 1995, recommended that the bill proceed without further amendment but advised that some aspects of the anti-siphoning provisions may require further attention in due course. I am grateful to Senator Alston for his indication that the opposition will support the government's amendments in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On resumption of the debate on 16 October Senator Tierney voiced several concerns which he had about the anti-siphoning legislation but indicated the coalition's support for the bill. The government welcomes that support. </PARA>

The government considers it appropriate to take this opportunity to introduce further amendments to improve the effectiveness of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. As a result, these amendments will deal with further operational aspects of the anti-siphoning provisions affecting the acquisition of broadcasting rights by pay TV licensees; cooperation between satellite subscription television broadcasting licences A and B; the allocation of second commercial television and radio broadcasting licences in solus markets; and a 15 per cent deemed control rule for the purposes of control limits in the act.

<PARA>The government considers it appropriate to take this opportunity to introduce further amendments to improve the effectiveness of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The government's proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill are designed to: streamline the allocation of second commercial television and radio broadcasting licences in solus markets; clarify the ownership and control provisions of the act by deeming a person to be in control of a company if that person holds company interests exceeding 15 per cent; further improve the operation of the anti-siphoning provisions dealing with the acquisition by pay television licensees of broadcasting rights to events listed under section 115 of the act; and ensure that satellite subscription television licensees A and B can cooperate in the way envisaged by section 116 without breaching the control provisions of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister announced on 25 August the government's intention to amend section 39 to streamline the allocation by the ABA of new commercial radio licences in those communities currently receiving only one commercial service. I will not go into this in great detail because Senator Alston has indicated already that the opposition will be supporting these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will remove the requirement for the ABA to first complete a licence area plan before allocating a second licence on application to an incumbent licensee in a solus market. This requirement has been a significant factor delaying the introduction of new services in under-served communities under section 39. Under the new provisions, the ABA need only examine frequency availability in the market. A deadline for section 39 applications will avoid delays to any subsequent allocations by the ABA of licences for independent services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opportunity has been taken to amend the eligibility requirements where two solus markets overlap. This will prevent a potentially inequitable outcome where there is a substantial population difference between the two markets. Proposed amendments to the solus television market provisions in section 73 were introduced earlier this year in the Communications and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim was to ensure that the ABA could allocate a licence for an incumbent broadcaster to operate a second commercial television service in the solus market in certain circumstances reflecting the solus radio provisions; impose a requirement that services continue to be operated for at least two years under the parent and second licence and cannot be separately transferred within this period; conduct a price based allocation process at any time during consideration of a section 73 application; and ensure there is no interest and capacity to operate an independent service, which is the key criterion for grant of a section 73 licence to an incumbent solus licensee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments further simplify and clarify the operation of the solus television provisions. They have also been made consistent, where appropriate, with the solus radio provisions. It will be mandatory for the ABA to allocate a second licence to an incumbent in the solus market if the criterion set out in the act is met. The criterion for absence of interest and capacity to operate an independent service, I might add, has not been changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current limit of one renewal of a second licence has been lifted. The risk otherwise is the loss of services to a community if at the end of the period no independent operator can be found. The ABA will be able to consider renewals for five-year periods indefinitely, subject to it being satisfied on each occasion that there is no interest and capacity to operate an independent service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to anti-siphoning, a mechanism is proposed to permit after an appropriate period the automatic removal of events from the anti-siphoning list when the event has concluded. A delay of seven days from the completion of the event is proposed, as this period would under normal circumstances give broadcasters a reasonable opportunity to provide coverage of an event at a time convenient to viewers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments provide the minister with reserve power to declare that a completed event will remain on the anti-siphoning list if he considers that this is desirable. It is envisaged that this power would only be used in exceptional circumstances. For example, the minister may decide to retain an event on the anti-siphoning list where none of the broadcasting rights have been made available to a national broadcaster or a commercial television licensee prior to the event occurring, but the minister is of the opinion that retaining the event on the list is likely to have the effect that the rights will subsequently be offered in a way which will maximise the chances for free to air coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the licence conditions set at paragraph 10(1e) of part 6 of schedule 2 was designed to ensure that the anti-siphoning regime cannot be circumvented through the acquisition of rights to an event only by a small regional broadcaster, thereby limiting free to air coverage of an event, which is not the intention of the anti-siphoning provisions. The proposed amendments provide that subscription television broadcasting licensees will be prohibited from acquiring the rights to televise a listed event unless a national broadcaster or commercial television broadcasting licensees who together have licence area populations that exceed 50 per cent of the population of Australia have already acquired the right to broadcast the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments also include a minor technical amendment to ensure that the acquisition of radio rights alone by a national broadcaster will not trigger the provisions of clause 10, but will enable a subscription television broadcasting licensee to acquire television rights to a listed event. An amendment to section 116 of the Broadcasting Services Act is necessary to allow satellite subscription licensees A and B to enter into cooperative agreements for the shared use of facilities without breaching the control limitations in section 110 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments put beyond doubt the ability of licensees A and B to enter into such agreements in relation to matters currently set down in section 116 of the act. Senator Alston knows from those previous prolonged debates that was always the intention. The proposed amendments also include a minor technical amendment to schedule 1 of the act to remove any doubt that the proposed provisions in the schedule dealing with concepts of control and tracing of company interests apply to subscription television broadcasting licences as well as to commercial television licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have simply canvassed, for the benefit of the committee, the government's support for those amendments which Senator Alston has indicated his support for, at least at this stage. I will delay my remarks on the 15 per cent until the appropriate time in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the supplementary radio operators on radio, we believe the amendment will allow a lot of new radio services in regional Australia.

The only glitch is the one that Senator Alston spoke about before, between 4SS and 4GY on the border of New South Wales and Queensland.

So we will be supporting those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments on supplementary licences for television are largely administrative and we hope they will result in new services, so we will be supporting those as well. We do have more of a problem with the anti-siphoning ones. As has been mentioned before, I am going to move an amendment after we see what happens with the government amendments. The problem I have is that the seven-day wait before automatic delisting I think is too long. My amendment is for automatic, therefore immediate, delisting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a worry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the 15 per cent company interest control test.

If someone has a lot of money&mdash;as many of the media proprietors do&mdash;and he is trying to get around the rules, as media proprietors constantly do, surely one has to expect that the ultimate regulator, the majority of the elected representatives in the parliament of this country, is going to try and stop him doing that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifteen per cent seems to me&mdash;and I think it would seem to most people&mdash;to be a reasonable limit. We have to provide a limit and it has to be plucked out of the air. This amendment will stop anyone else who is not over the 15 per cent now from going over the 15 per cent because that would impose control. It would be a limit of control. It gives a technical advantage to anyone who is currently over the 15 per cent because Senator Alston is not going to oppose the grandfathering clause. The grandfathering clause would be in there no matter what. Whoever is over the 15 per cent now has an advantage and will retain that advantage. Whoever is over 15 per cent now is not disadvantaged by this clause. I do not think that that is a particularly good thing. </PARA>

I accept that that is not going to happen because neither side is going to vote for that. So I am just going to leave that one alone. This is a matter about which I certainly said a great deal in television and radio press interviews.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have clear guidelines. These are clear guidelines. I am going to vote for clear guidelines. The only problem I have with this amendment is that it is in the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill and it is not where it was supposed to be in the communications omnibus bill as part of a package. I had expected the two issues of control&mdash;closing the 15 per cent, which we have here, plus widening the definition of `company interest' to include economic interest&mdash;to come up as a package. I was told they would come up as a package. Indeed, as everybody knows, they were originally in the communications omnibus bill. Now, one of them has been taken out and put here. I can understand the urgency for that but I think there is an urgency for the other one as well. I am certainly going to vote for this amendment. Once I see the other one and look at it, I am more than likely to vote for that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Alston looks at it, he will see that the amendment does include foreign ownership as well as limits on control over commercial radio and television.

I had no luck behind the scenes trying to get these two bills put up together. I was not supported by either the government or the opposition for quite reasonable reasons. I could see both of their points of view but I was not supported in that. I wish I had been, but we do not see it here. </PARA>

There was a real problem with those other guidelines in that they were not clear and media operators, who have a lot of money, were able to get over them. I mean any media operator; I am not talking about Mr Packer here. Just because he happened to do it in the first place does not mean that every single other media operator was not going to do it tomorrow.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I respond to some of the logic that has just been advanced in support of the government's amendments. As I heard Senator Bourne, she said that what we now have are clear guidelines. But they are not guidelines; they are arbitrary rules. The problem is that she also said that she had supported arrangements which said that 15 per cent was deemed to constitute control unless you could prove to the contrary, and that has been the law since 1991, I think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that you were able to exceed 15 per cent as long as you could demonstrate you were not in control has been a matter of public debate for at least 18 months. That is the precise point of the inquiry that the ABA conducted into Packer's control of Fairfax&mdash;to use shorthand. The problem is that at all times the government had made it quite clear that the whole purpose of the act was to ensure that you could not control two areas of the media&mdash;television and print in this instance&mdash;and control was the operative concept. As Michael Lee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Control is the key. Control is fundamental to promoting diversity and under the act control is the trip-wire. In some ways it does not matter whether someone is above or below 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Michael Lee was saying back in February this year&mdash;that control was what it was all about. In order to determine whether someone was in control, if there was evidence demonstrating that it was below 15 per cent, you were presumed not to be in control. If you had over 15 per cent, you were presumed to be in control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA, as we discovered fascinatingly in estimates the other night, has actually been looking at this issue in relation to CanWest and Channel 10 for about four years. But they only took, from memory, seven weeks or five weeks in relation to the question of whether ConsPress was in control of Fairfax. They did precisely what the act required them to do; what everyone understood the act to mean; what media commentators had canvassed for 12 months or more in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot say you are getting around an act if you are simply using the clear terms of the act. We actually inserted a control test into the Broadcasting Services Act some years ago. We did that because we recognised the primacy of control, and we did it because we also accepted that arbitrary percentage figures do not prove anything. As I have said many times, if you were really fair dinkum about the proposition that you should not control, or have an interest in, more than one area of the media&mdash;and even Senator Bob Collins will recall that in relation to satellite subscription television licences there is a prohibition on crossholdings of more than two per cent between the A and B licensees&mdash;that effectively says, `You can't have shares in both. There might be some accidental crossholding. We are prepared to tolerate it at that level.' But if you were fair dinkum about not wanting people to be in both, then you would not allow crossholdings of any magnitude.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is what it is all about. What I have said consistently is that there is a hell of a lot happening around the world in terms of new technologies. These cross-media rules are a dog's breakfast because they do not apply, not only to telecommunications but also to magazines or to pay television. There is so much happening that you need the review that you have talked about for so long. What we have said consistently is that you do not pre-empt the review by coming up with arbitrary bandaid propositions that are unrelated to control, and I gave the example of Prime Television. Once Prime got over 15 per cent, under these new rules it is deemed to be in control&mdash;automatically; no argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does `control' mean? `Control' means you call the shots, but they cannot because Channel 7 has more than 50 per cent. So, by any test, they have the numbers on the board, and they are in absolute and total control for those purposes. So how can you have two players who have conflicting commercial interests both in control of the one organisation? It is a nonsense; it is a non sequitur. It simply undermines the whole concept that is supposed to be what the cross-media rules are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say that this is not a question of redressing some sort of hitherto unrecognised loophole. This is a matter of rules that have been in place for some years that have been applied. We very much supported the ABA; in fact, I have been critical of the ABA and its processes for not having speedy hearings, for not having public hearings, for not always requiring evidence to be taken on oath, and for simply accepting letters from solicitors saying, `My client denies the allegations,' and then leaving it at that. They seem to have gone further, from what I learnt the other night, in relation to Channel 10. But the fact remains that if you are going to take three or four years to complete an inquiry, or to have a role in monitoring an inquiry, again I do not think you are acting in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you need is what happened in this instance. They had a quick inquiry in five or seven weeks. They made a judgment as to whether control was constituted by 17.2 per cent, and they decided it was not. The minute that decision was announced, the minute the rules worked the way they were meant to work, all of the government's rhetoric went out the window. What Michael Lee had said about control being the key, control being fundamental, the cross-media ownership rules working well and their being quite happy to leave it to the ABA&mdash;all that went out the window. That is not coincidental. It is purely and simply because the government thought the ABA would do the hatchet job. When they did not, the government stepped in and did it for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let there be no misunderstanding. We are very much in support of a comprehensive overhaul of the cross-media rules. The government has promised it for months, indeed years, and has not done it. The sooner we get on with looking at all the different concepts that are applying elsewhere the better. It is not an easy issue. No-one pretends there are magical solutions, but to think that somehow you can pluck a percentage figure out of the air and end up with this nonsense where two diametrically opposed interests are both deemed to be in control is absolutely ludicrous. An arbitrary 15 per cent will not solve anything; it is not a clear guideline, it is an arbitrary and unworkable rule. It totally pre-empts the review. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing arbitrary, as Senator Alston knows, about the 15 per cent. A lot of consideration was given to setting that threshold. At the end of the day, as everyone would concede, it is a matter for judgment, as it has to be. Lower fixed limits under 15 per cent&mdash;say, 10 per cent&mdash;in the view of the government, which I think is correct, would have captured large amounts of interest irrelevant to the objects of the Broadcasting Services Act, and would have constrained investment in the media. For these reasons a limit below 15 per cent was not considered practical or realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government also considered that limits over 15 per cent would actually constitute a relaxation of the current rules when all the evidence that is around, and there is a lot of it, indicates that in fact those rules need to be tighter. A 15 per cent limit was chosen because it is an existing ownership threshold in the act, and the removal of the discretion for persons to prove they do not control a company at levels in excess of 15 per cent toughens the effect of this threshold, and that is what we are unblushingly doing. It provides greater certainty and transparency in the operations of the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again to explode Senator Alston's conspiracy theory, and it is a nonsense about what role the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might play, I would like to point out to Senator Alston what the facts are&mdash;and they are on the public record. He referred to the ABA examination. It is a fact that this is where this has come from. The ABA examined this provision. Speaking from a personal point of view, the original objects of having that flexibility, I think, frankly, were laudable. In a perfect world where everybody does the right thing and looks after where everyone is supposed to go, I think that that kind of flexibility is desirable. But the reality is, and experience has proven, as Senator Bourne has said, that fleets of lawyers with these resources can be employed on the subject.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to lead for the opposition in the Senate on the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995. We are opposed to this bill and will be dividing on the bill. Our opposition to the bill is strong and unequivocal. This legislation has been put up to set up yet another rort for the Maritime Union of Australia&mdash;the great friends of the ALP mates, especially the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal effect of the legislation is to provide $19 million to the members of the Maritime Union of Australia. This bill is dipping into the pockets of Australian taxpayers and taking out $19 million. The taxpayers are having this money ripped from their pockets because the Keating government wants to solve a domestic union disagreement with the union. We should focus on the shonky reasons that gave rise to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This deal was struck to try to resolve an industrial dispute. It revolved around the privatisation of ANL. We recall the strike last year by the MUA when the government said it would sell its share in Australian Stevedores, which is owned by ANL. The strike cost $60 million and many more millions in indirect costs and enhanced Australia's reputation for unreliability on the waterfront. Coming out of this dispute is this tax funded deal for the ALP's mates at the MUA. Close study of the bill reveals this $19 million tax funded subsidy to the Maritime Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum says that this is all about placing Australian shipping operators on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in relation to crew costs. This is said to provide incentives for Australian shipping to develop new international trading opportunities. We need to improve as Australian flag ships carry only four per cent of Australia's foreign trade. This minister's rationale for the legislation is dishonest nonsense. The explanatory memorandum misrepresents the purpose of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the bill is to provide an incentive or a sop in the form of a taxable grant payable to the employers of Australian seafarers on Australian operated ships engaged in international trade. The amount of the grant will be equal to the notional tax payable on the earnings of the crews serving on that ship. To qualify, the ship must be Australian operated, its crew must be employed by an Australian employer and the ship must spend no less than half its operational time in a year on international voyages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This grant solution proposed in this bill was not Minister Brereton's original plan. Mr Brereton advocated a proposal that the government would not levy PAYE tax on these crews. Minister Brereton backed away from this advice when the Australian Tax Office wisely said that it would create a very dangerous precedent for other industry employee groups. This measure that we are now considering provides a grant in the form of a recognisable subsidy to the Australian shipping industry. The Australian Shipowners Association supports this for obvious reasons. Why would it look a gift-horse in the mouth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has told that association that we do not support it. Without other wide ranging reforms envisaged in the Taylor recommendations, including the opening up foreign crewing and the removal of cabotage protection, this bill is an expensive farce to cover up the government's incompetence in managing the sale of the ANL. Again, the raw power of the AMU is clear as the union continues to veto the sale of the ANL to P&amp;O. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to taxpayers and Australia's competitiveness of this sweetheart deal and other measures to the AMU is enormous. Some $19 million will blow out as Australian operators put up more ships to qualify for this grant. The government says it will be one additional ship per year, but that is an underestimate. The extra cost of one ship would be $400,000 per year. On this basis, the net impact of this grant over five years will be a total of $59 million. This will be much more if more ships qualify for the grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about other costs where this Keating government has bowed to the desires of the AMU? You can add up the account for the Australian taxpayers: $19 million for this measure, $145 million for the fiasco at ANL and nearly $1 million for the services of the mates of Brereton, Wran and Turnbull for their part-time consultancy of two days a week&mdash;and that is not a bad little earner for anyone, is it? On the waterfront itself we have $450 million paid to the 4,000 retiring wharfies over and above their superannuation benefits under the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program&mdash;all this largesse for the mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that Minister Collins has just walked out of the chamber because he was the main one responsible for setting up that last sweetheart deal I mentioned. Now we have yet another one, all of this at a time when we are supposed to be improving efficiency on the waterfront, improving efficiency with our shipping, and we find that the government is paying off its mates yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition strongly opposes this legislation. Australia has had enough of this featherbedding of government interest groups. What about the farmers? Compare the treatment that the government is handing out to its mates with how it has treated the farmers over the last four years. On this basis, we oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to highlight the absolute crisis which this government has allowed to occur in our vital tuna fishing relationship with Japan. For some time Australia and Japan have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship on the tuna industry. It is a relationship which returns to Australia $100 million and a considerable amount more in the provision of invaluable scientific data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in my own state of Tasmania at the techno-park at Glenorchy, one of the firms has manufactured devices which are implanted into the tuna to allow scientists from Japan and Australia to actually study their migratory patterns and, hopefully, understand their breeding and growth habits for the good of the industry. It is a very cosy relationship, or it has been, between the Japanese and the Australian government as far as the scientific side of it goes. But this relationship is in tatters because of a boycott of Australian ports by the Japanese over catch quotas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the federal government continues to allow this matter to go unresolved, Japanese vessels will be visiting Bali, Singapore and South Africa for their port calls. Australia, Japan and New Zealand are joint signatories to the Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna. The commission is responsible for setting a worldwide limit on what these three countries can catch. At present, Australia's allocation is 5,265 tonnes, Japan's allocation is 6,065 tonnes and New Zealand's quota is 420 tonnes. The Japanese scientists argue that the parental biomass of tuna has recovered to the point where it can sustain an increase in the Japanese quota of between 1,000 and 6,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that almost all the southern bluefin tuna caught throughout the world finds its way to Japan, where the Japanese are prepared to pay premium prices for what they regard as a precious product. It is not unheard of to see some of this tuna selling for thousands of dollars in the Japan fish market. Australian scientists are perhaps understandably cautious as to the potential of the biomass to recover and, to date, are not prepared to endorse the claims that have been made by the Japanese scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that the existing quotas are to expire in January 1996. With little evidence of a genuine effort by the Australian government to resolve the issue, the Japanese have taken the step of withdrawing their tuna boats from two Australian ports which act as bases&mdash;namely, Fremantle and Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point very clearly that, in raising this matter in the Senate today, I am not taking sides and offering support for the views of the Japanese scientists any more than I am expressing the views of our own scientists. I am saying that this whole matter should not have been allowed to deteriorate to this position. As my colleague Senator Denman from Tasmania would know, the visits by Japanese tuna vessels to the ports of Hobart and Fremantle are an essential component of the financial lifeblood of those ports. Under those circumstances, the federal Minister for Resources, David Beddall, should have intervened before now to resolve this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers in this government are supposed to lead. They are not supposed to sit back and watch a crisis unfold before they become involved. Unfortunately, we have seen that far too often lately. For instance, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, sat back and watched ANL get to the situation where it is virtually unsaleable. He sat back and watched this crisis developing in the industrial relations area where my state and other states will be held to ransom by rolling strikes. In this particular case the Minister for Resources, David Beddall, has sat back and watched this happen and we are at a situation where the President of Tuna Boat Owners of Australia, Mr Brian Jeffries, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the boycott&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a major blow for the ports&mdash;there's no question about that.</PARA>
<PARA>Nowhere is the effect of the boycott and this government's ineptitude being felt more severely than in my own state of Tasmania, particularly in the port of Hobart. It is estimated that between now and the end of January that boycott will cost the Tasmanian economy more than $6 million. For the small port of Hobart, that is quite a significant amount of money, seeing that we have just lost a contractor ship out of Hobart from ANM. That has gone to Senator Denman's home port of Burnie. Nevertheless, the Japanese fishing boats coming into Hobart are very significant. Had the federal government not allowed this boycott to occur, around 45 Japanese tuna boats would have visited the port of Hobart over the coming months. When you consider that each vessel can spend up to $150,000 on fuel, fresh food, fruit and vegetables and other provisions and services, you get to picture the full impact which this boycott is having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Hobart Marine Board has estimated that the loss of the Japanese tuna boats will cost the board at least $50,000, mainly in pilot fees, by the end of January. I have been reliably informed that the future viability of up to three businesses operating in the port of Hobart have been threatened by the boycott. Sources within that industry have predicted that unless this matter is resolved immediately 15 very precious jobs will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through all of this, the voice of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has remained silent. As is usual, he has been unseen and unheard while a vital Tasmanian opportunity, not half a kilometre from his office, faces devastation. Like all his Labor colleagues in Tasmania, Mr Kerr has once again demonstrated that he is not prepared to fight for local issues on behalf of his constituents if it means upsetting his political masters in Canberra. At the end of the day, if it takes my pushing to get Mr Kerr to react, then so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important to place on the record that here we have a lucrative opportunity for Tasmania ready to disappear down the drain, yet we cannot see one Labor member or senator who is prepared to do anything about it. The federal Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall, must intervene to resolve the impasse which currently exists and he must do so immediately. Every day this government fails to respond costs the Tasmanian economy hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Japanese boycott of our ports is further evidence that this is a tired government unable to offer answers to problems of any substance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is at the forefront of climate research, particularly in the effect and predictability of meteorological phenomena such as the El Nino southern oscillation index, which of course affects a great deal of the world apart from Australia. This morning I opened the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation's conference on managing with climate variability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has allocated around $7 million for climate variability research since 1992. One of the purposes of this conference that is being held at the moment is that it is the halfway point in that major research project on the prediction of climate for a greater tool for management of farming and the protection of the environment. That was funded with a $2.1 million research grant from this government. In the drought package that was developed by the government, a further $5.1 million was provided to extend that research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one needs to be reminded of the regular and often devastating impact that drought has on our farmers, their families and their communities&mdash;and I might add the significant impact on the environment. What we can do about it and what we have been doing is to recognise that we have a highly variable climate in Australia&mdash;one of the most variable in the world&mdash;and to develop better ways of coping with it. This is also the reason behind our strong support of and commitment to the establishment of an international centre for climate prediction. This proposal has been put forward, and a recent meeting was held in the United States to establish such a centre. It was heartening to know that there is international recognition for Australia's expertise in this regard. Our delegates to that conference made it clear that Australia will support the establishment of such an international centre of climate predictability. A working party has been established to set it up, and Australia will continue to support it strongly, including the necessary financial support if it should eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a leader in climate research, Australia will be able to make a significant contribution to international cooperation in this area. We are not only pioneering the development of new scientific techniques; we are well ahead of the rest in providing this information to farmers to help them plan their farming strategy. That advice is very important to profitable, sustainable farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact, as indicated by the research documents that have already been produced, that across the board in Australia you get three decent years out of every 10 on average. In those 10 years you get three or four reasonable years and two or three very difficult years indeed. Meteorologists, in conjunction with the CSIRO and primary industry departments across Australia, are developing systems that will give farmers better information to predict the odds on these climatic events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently, a number of farms in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales were adversely affected by frost. It greatly interested me that, with the groundbreaking work being done at centres such as those in Toowoomba, with a combined CSIRO and Queensland DPI operation, growers in that region were given warning that that frost was coming based on the SOI information. In fact, that prediction proved to be accurate. I understand that a number of growers in that region took that advice and delayed plantings. As a result, they escaped most of the damage from that particular event. That is just an indication of how this is now being used to directly help growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government will continue to provide the substantial support for climate research in Australia.

Can the minister advise the Senate about an announcement earlier this week by the Treasurer of a $400 million investment by BHP in a blast furnace at Port Kembla? How did the Commonwealth encourage this investment? Is this indicative of a generally positive outlook on investment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is some economic news, and very good economic news. The Development Allowance Authority approved an allowance for BHP's support of Port Kembla steel works. This week the Treasurer announced it. BHP is investing $400 million in a blast furnace at Port Kembla. Up to 3,000 people will be employed on this at peak construction time; 900 people are employed currently. It is the first blast furnace made in Australia for 23 years; the last one was in 1972. It will be operational in March next year. It will replace two smaller blast furnaces with state of the art technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development allowance was first enunciated by the government in the One Nation initiative. It is a stimulus to national investment. It provides a tax deduction of 10 per cent of the capital expenditure incurred in the acquisition or lease of new plant and equipment for projects with a capital expenditure of $50 million or more. So far 270 projects worth $75 billion&mdash;that is, $75 billion in new investment&mdash;have been registered for the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in association with this that the Access Economics quarterly economic investment monitor reports that there is $123 billion worth of investment either actual, under construction, in planning or projected for Australia at the present time. That is a huge boost in capital investment and major projects for this country. The competitive test, under which the allowance authority provided this write-off for BHP, requires applicants to demonstrate that their industrial relations practice is at the world best practice level and that the cost of inputs is both economic and efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have an allowance that levers major national investment, creates a basis for Australian industry to grow and to expand, and also creates a climate in which there can be cooperation developed in the workplace between the work force and the companies concerned so that that investment is able to be worked at the most productive level. World's best practice in industrial relations is part of this. It is in contrast perhaps to what has happened in other parts of this industry elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steel industry, for which this investment is destined, is one of the core industries in the national economy. Nearly over a decade ago, just before we came to power, BHP were openly talking about closing down their steel industry. During the period of the Fraser government it had become inefficient. When we came to power, we created the Button steel plan, which was based on tripartite consultations between the unions, governments and the companies. As a result, in the last 10 years, productivity in steel has trebled. In 1983-84 production was at 175 tonnes per person; last year it was 618 tonnes per person. In 1984, we exported less than one million tonnes; last year we exported 317 million tonnes. These are indications of progress in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last 10 years, BHP has invested over $6 billion in the domestic steel industry. All this comes from the basis we created with the Button steel plan, which enabled this core sector of the Australian economy to rebound from being on the ropes and going out backwards to being one of the most competitive and profitable industries in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Childs for his important question. This is an area where last week the government made a major announcement at the National Training Authority's ministerial council meeting. It decided that next year $875 million of Commonwealth funds will be allocated to vocational education and training in Australia. That is an increase of $90 million from this year and it will generate 40,000 additional student places for vocational training in Australia. It brings the increase in Commonwealth spending on vocational education and training since 1992 to 80 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth now contributes 35 per cent of public funds to vocational education and training compared with 17 per cent in 1992. As Senator Childs has asked, I can indicate that in his own state of New South Wales the Carr Labor government will increase its real recurrent expenditure on vocational education and training in 1996 by $8 million. Commonwealth growth funds in 1996 will build on this by generating nearly 12,500 additional student places in New South Wales, bringing the total number to 383,000, which is a big improvement on the situation under the previous state Liberal government.</PARA>

The Commonwealth has had to use its increased leverage in funding of vocational education and training to, unfortunately, coerce these uncooperative coalition state governments to meet their responsibilities under the ANTA agreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, Minister Crean has announced a significant new initiative to assist labour market participants to find affordable child care. It is based on the very successful jobs, education and training program&mdash;that program which made sure that people, particularly single parents, who were looking to get back into employment through a training program should be assisted with child care if they were unable to find their own child-care places. It has been a very successful program to the point where it is now being used as a model well outside of the needs for just single mothers.

As well, when a family is unable to find care, the Department of Human Services and Health will assist by finding an arrangement of temporary add-on of places to an existing centre or by seeking to find a permanent place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year, it was announced that the Australian College of Midwives was to be the coordinating body for the carriage of the WHO-UNICEF baby friendly hospital initiative in Australia. This decision was reached following the decision by UNICEF to review its direct involvement in developed countries and to restrict its involvement in Australia to the tune of some $10,000. So there has been a bit of a gap in the process towards accreditation of baby friendly hospitals. Despite the fact that there are only two accredited in Australia, many more are in the process of meeting the criteria in their objective to become accredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cessation of free and low-cost supplies of infant formula was placed on the agenda at the Australian health ministers conference in June 1995. After lengthy discussions what was agreed was that an appropriate strategy would be for all state and territory governments to encourage the individual state and territories to address this in their respective jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some concern under the Australian Trade Practices Act that there could be collusion aspects whereby agreements with individual manufacturers to enter a separate agreement with government might be contravening the legislation. Despite the legislation constraints, some manufacturers have individually ceased the supply of free and low-cost infant formula to hospitals and community health centres. I think that is a matter we should acknowledge and appreciate. It is also an area of some difficulty but while manufacturers are proceeding that way, that is the way the government would prefer to see us go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to your question about sector agreement on the promotion of bottles and teats in Australia, the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs is currently negotiating with the Baby Products Association on the development of an agreement based on the WHO code. In 1989, the WHO and UNICEF published a joint statement entitled `Protecting, promoting and supporting breast feeding and the special role of maternity services'. That set global standards for maternal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services wrote to the states and territories urging the adoption of the 10 steps to successful breastfeeding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer but encouragement is just not working. In at least two states the impact of case-mix funding is such that mums are being pushed out of hospital earlier and earlier with no support, or very little support, and the rate of breastfeeding in this country is actually dropping. We do not even have any decent statistics now in place in most states. They just don't want to know. They don't even want to monitor what is happening. Therefore, surely it is up to the federal government to make sure&mdash;in other words, to force&mdash;states are part of a program that won't only be of great benefits to mums and babies. For example, it reduces the incidence of breast cancer and it reduces the incidence of osteoporosis in later life, and there is a list of at least two dozen benefits to babies. Surely the federal government should take a lead and ensure that states are part of this program.</PARA></TALK.START>

I also believe it is very difficult: whenever our state colleagues get into trouble they turn to the Commonwealth, which has to try to lever them. The states demand their individual rights but then do not deliver, leaving the Commonwealth log jammed in this area, particularly, for example, in terms of agreements like Medicare&mdash;and I again cite Victoria.

The government decided during the budget process to increase the benchmark dividend payout ratio to 60 per cent for all wholly owned GBEs apart from Telstra.

<PARA>This afternoon we had one of the most disgraceful attacks on a man, now a former royal commissioner, that I have ever seen. In defence of Commissioner Marks, now Mr Marks, I think it is appropriate to let his own words speak for himself. He says what we all know, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The investigatory process aims at discovery of the truth and is a valuable tool of democratic government for peace and good order.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know that anyone could possibly disagree with that. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The investigatory process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is what a royal commission is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should not be abandoned nor fail to be used only because a disadvantage might flow to a political party and an advantage to another.</PARA>
<PARA>He adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preservation of our system of government depends on preservation of public power to learn the truth of events in which there is a community interest. The power needs to be strengthened not weakened.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know anybody, even on the other side, who could possibly disagree with that. But we might come to a disagreement on this point: Commissioner Marks says, and he is right in saying so:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is accepted as fundamental to the administration of justice that impartiality of the decision maker and confidence in that person by parties&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that are before him or her&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and by the public depend on his or her freedom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the decision maker&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(and also that of witnesses) from intimidation or pressure . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is no point in having a fact-finding exercise, be it a court or a royal commission, if the decision maker and the witnesses before that decision maker are in any way intimidated or pressured. The royal commissioner goes on to point out the sort of intimidation that he had to suffer and that members of the commission had to suffer under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, as soon as the commission was announced, this government did not worry about whether they liked the terms of reference. Even before they knew them, this government decided they would rubbish the commission from beginning to end&mdash;not just the people involved, but the terms of reference, the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sought to make much of the fact, for example, that Mr Gyles asked the commissioner to disqualify himself. Let us see what the commissioner has to say about that. He points out that, on the particular day application was made to have him disqualify himself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grounds were without substance but put forward, as is a common experience for a Royal Commissioner&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is not something unusual, it is common experience for royal commissioners&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as part of a perceived protection against the risk of adverse finding. Moreover,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in this case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">its timing coincided with activity outside the Commission in response to widely publicised evidence capable of doing damage to particular interests.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone can tell you what the commissioner is saying there. He is saying that if you want to continue to be able to use royal commissions, if you want to have a fact-finding mechanism that is outside the parliament, one that reduces the political aspect of a fact-finding process by going outside the parliament, then you have to protect it. You cannot start rubbishing it from day one and continue to rubbish it; you cannot keep intimidating the decision maker and the people involved. That is what has happened here. Personal attacks were made on the commissioner, on counsel assisting the commission, and it goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears, after Senator Ray's disgraceful contribution today, that this man, this senior citizen&mdash;I think he is in his sixties&mdash;who has made a long and valued contribution to the legal profession and the justice system of this country, will be hounded to his grave. Why? Because he participated in a royal commission, and the Labor Party does not happen to like the findings. What do you do? You pursue someone&mdash;not just threaten them not to take the job, not just abuse them when they are in the job, but get stuck into them when they finish the job. You chase them down to the grave.

He was carrying out an executive function. As he himself said, he was carrying out an investigatory process, and that should be made quite clear.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I put to the Senate that the reason for the calling of this royal commission was founded in long-held principles recently enunciated by the High Court. I refer to the case of Theophanous and the Herald and Weekly Times, where the High Court stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are legitimate reasons why the claims of the holders of high office in a representative government must be subordinated to the need for open and effective scrutiny and discussion of their official conduct and suitability.</PARA>
<PARA>This royal commission was to look into whether there was an improper or inappropriate use of executive power. And that, I would put to the Senate, is a thoroughly reasonable foundation for the calling of a royal commission. So when we look at the reason for the calling of this royal commission, we do not see any witch-hunt, as Senator McKiernan said; we see thoroughly well-founded principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the process that commissioner Marks pursued, it was again one which was proper. In fact, he did not rely on hearsay evidence. I refer to his report where he was looking at direct evidence. In relation to the infamous meeting of cabinet, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were 16 persons who might have been present. The Premier was one, the Secretary Kobelke another and 14 members of Cabinet. Eight of these persons testified&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress `testified'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that Dr Lawrence initiated discussion about the sponsoring of the Easton allegations. These eight were unanimous that it was Dr Lawrence who raised the matter. Dr Lawrence denied that she initiated any such discussion and denied that such discussion took place at all.</PARA>
<PARA>You cannot get it more direct than that. Commissioner Marks was relying upon direct evidence of people who were there&mdash;people who had no reason to give evidence contrary to Dr Lawrence. In fact, eight of them were from the cabinet over which she presided as Premier. So when you look at it, Commissioner Marks relied on direct evidence and believable witnesses. And, as well as those eight, there were another six who testified against Dr Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did Commissioner Marks engage in proper process; he gave Dr Lawrence's counsel every opportunity to cross-examine these witnesses. What is more, Dr Lawrence's counsel were given more than adequate opportunity to challenge this royal commission in the Supreme Court of Western Australia and the High Court of this country. I do not know how much more Dr Lawrence needs by way of assistance. You only have to look at her legal fees&mdash;$619,000 of assistance from the Commonwealth Government. That represents seven per cent of the Commonwealth's total funding for legal aid. It represents 13 per cent of Commonwealth funds attributed to the Aboriginal Legal Service for one year in Western Australia. That is what Dr Lawrence got in one bite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And not only that. Dr Lawrence was given funding for her solicitors plus two counsel. I put it to the Senate that that is unreasonable, that a person in that situation does not need two counsel. That is extravagant on the part of the government. The funds involve a sum of $243,000 for the challenges I mentioned&mdash;$243,000 of Australian taxpayers' money was spent in challenging the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the worst part is still to come. Dr Lawrence lost three challenges. The question of costs has still to be determined, but there was a cost order against her in the High Court. The government cannot tell the people of Australia whether it is going to meet those costs. I put it to the Senate that it is thoroughly inappropriate that this government bear the costs of audit against Dr Lawrence for her futile challenges. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a background of alarm for the union movement. Why is it alarmed? Because the work force is walking out on unions. Less than a third of the work force are now members of a union. Why are they walking out? Because the union movement has let them down. It has let them down in terms of low wage outcomes. It has let them down in terms of conditions. What the workers of Australia have realised is that they can do better by themselves. They can do better if they go out and negotiate individual contracts or if they negotiate enterprise contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions, of course, had the opportunity to adjust to the new opportunities, but they were not capable of doing so. They have not been able to respond to the changing industrial relations environment. Therefore, the workers have deserted them, because they have been able to do better by themselves. The return to the class warfare rhetoric has been linked to the unions' effort to reassert collectivism as the best means of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy knows it well. So many union leaders have been pensioned off because they have not been able to cope with the change. Too many of them have been pensioned off to the Labor side of this chamber. Collectivism is an alternative but if the workers can do better through individual agreements or if they can do better through enterprise agreements, why shouldn't they do so? Why should they be forced back into the old ways of the collectivist processes of the past?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this government and these former unionist leaders opposite do not seem to understand: workers have been voting with their feet. Rather than facing up to the need to change and to adjust to the new opportunities and challenges, the union movement has decided to resort to the old tactics of thuggery, bringing the nation to heel. They want to take out the waterfront and the building enterprises&mdash;each of the industries that are threatened: the mining, building, chemical, transport and manufacturing industries. Did you hear Jennie George listing them the other night, saying that one by one they will be taken out and the country will be brought to ransom until the union movement has reasserted its traditional power base?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it is all about; it is not about the interests of or benefits to individual workers, workers who have voted with their feet and got out of the system for something better. They are going to be dragged back, to their detriment. Sadly, what this government has done through the accord is link in the whole of the economic policies of the nation to the lowest common denominator outcome of collectivism in bargaining. Basically, the workers have done badly under the unions' preferred alternative. This government has locked in those outcomes through its accord with the ACTU leadership: government in partnership with the union movement to produce low and disappointing outcomes for workers. </PARA>

Yes, I am a former trade union official, as is Senator Murphy. A number of us are former trade union officials. We do not apologise for that and we do not see the relevance of it. Every time someone from a rural background&mdash;a farmer&mdash;gets up on your side to speak, do we say, `You are driven by the vested interests of your rural background?' Do we say that the National Party runs your policy all the time? We know it is the reverse, in fact. You are running the National Party's agenda. It cannot get anything up any more. So it is irrelevant to talk about the background of senators and where they come from. It is typical of the approach you take today to politics and is one of the reasons you are in opposition. I make no apologies about my background or about where I came from, what I fought for and what I still fight for. </PARA>

The widespread industrial action that has occurred and is threatened to occur commenced two days ago. </PARA>

The Prime Minister acted immediately to contact the various parties to this dispute. In the last few hours the chief executive of CRA, Mr Leon Davis, has issued a statement welcoming the Prime Minister's intervention in this dispute. In his media release Mr Davis said that the company would be stopping the legal actions that it commenced against the employees at Weipa and that the company was prepared to attend hearings of the Industrial Relations Commission to address the disparity between award workers and workers on staff contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>

He said that the union movement is intent on bringing back to the field the workers on individual contracts and to lower the playing field. In fact, it is the reverse.

That is what they are intent on doing. CRA's belligerent and over-the-top response to that has been, in part, to initiate legal action. I have to say that CRA has been reasonably effective in recent years, if you measure the time and the cost of going through the Industrial Relations Commission, of initiating proceedings in the commission. CRA has been spinning out the time matters take in the commission by a variety of legal strategies to frustrate the activities of the trade union movement and workers who want to receive a reasonable outcome in the various negotiations that have occurred at Weipa and at other sites around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have an opposition that expects the Prime Minister to resolve a very deep-seated industrial dispute overnight. It is a deep-seated industrial dispute which has existed for four or five years at other places apart from Weipa. Industrial relations does not work like that. The opposition is showing its ignorance if it thinks that the Prime Minister, or a union official for that matter, can snap his fingers and everything is resolved overnight. It does not work like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with human beings involved in very, very complex sets of negotiations. Not even the Prime Minister can make a quickie phone call and everything is right the next day. Hopefully, today or tomorrow we will see what success of the Prime Minister's activities have had. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) yesterday and today has had meetings with the company and with the ACTU. He is satisfied that the parties are negotiating in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some of the detailed matters in these discussions have to be finalised before the Industrial Relations Commission. The commission is not irrelevant to this issue. It has a very important role. Both the parties have indicated a willingness to attend hearings that the commission convenes and that the commission has been holding over some time. So I think the indications are reasonably good. We do not know the final outcome, but I think the indications are reasonably good. Certainly, the Prime Minister has played a very effective role in negotiating with the parties and bringing them together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at our record while we have been in government, the level of industrial disputes in this country over the last 12 or 13 years has reduced very significantly. There are a range of reasons for that but, certainly, one of the reasons has been the effectiveness of the accord relationship with the trade union movement. We have only recently seen what the outcome will be under the opposition. We have only got to see what occurred in Western Australia recently with the total backdown there of the Liberal Party state government. The level of industrial disputation in this country over the last 12 or 13 years has declined significantly. It has more than halved. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think this dispute highlights is that the approach by CRA at the Weipa site and at other sites throughout Australia to exclude the trade union movement has been unproductive.

BHP has involved the trade union movement in its reform process and has achieved very significant outcomes in terms of productivity. </PARA>

How many political leaders around the world contact both the industrial trade union leadership and the company leadership within a day of a dispute commencing? There are very few who would do that. In fact, most do not get involved at all in this sort of dispute. So the Prime Minister has been effective.

The trouble with conducting this debate in this chamber today is that really is what the case is: we are just demonstrating our blinkered vision and our refusal to recognise just what is going on out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that conducting this debate in this chamber today really does not contribute to the resolution of the problem at all. The conducting of the debate by the two representatives of the opposing theories in this area was expressed very well in an article under the headline `Bovver boys play hardball', which was written by Michael Millett in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. I will continue with how he expresses it because I think it is quite instructive. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dramatically escalating Weipa dispute has focused attention on two of the key players in next year's Federal election campaign&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, and his Opposition counterpart, Mr Reith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pair are the archetypal "bovver boys" of Federal politics.</PARA>
<PARA>It is really about this shaping up, this sabre rattling and this taking a symbolic position, rather than looking at how the actual situation can be resolved. I ask the Senate: will this discussion today do anything at all to resolve the actual dispute? What is the coalition actually trying to achieve by proposing that this particular matter of public importance be discussed? Is it trying to escalate the problem or is it actually doing anything to protect the ordinary Australians from the consequences of industrial action, as is expressed in the proposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see more efforts being made to encourage the disputing parties to return to the only forum in which resolution can be effected&mdash;that is, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; not here, there. I suppose, if we are not going to do that in this chamber, the other positive thing that we might be able to do is to improve the legislation, because the claim is that this situation has arisen within the present laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ray told us yesterday, the government's position was that this dispute has arisen not because of the law but in spite of it. Nevertheless, it has occurred and, as Jennie George suggests, the law could be improved. In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Kenneth Davidson suggests that the legislation could be improved. He suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That legislation could take the form of a prohibition on employers offering individual contracts to employees, if acceptance of those contracts meant the employees were unable to bargain collectively through their union.</PARA>

<PARA>I am not suggesting that that is necessarily the way to go but, if we are to do anything in this place, we would be more productive in debating that sort of question rather than the question that we have before us at the moment, which is simply a political point scoring exercise and which actually does not do anything to resolve the problem. The problem that we have before us is the previous couple of days where, rather than discuss and rather than try to seek a resolution themselves, the parties involved have been taking pot shots at each other. That does not resolve it, nor is it resolved by us in here conducting the same sort of exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks made by Senator Hill on this matter of public importance. Firstly, let me say, Senator Bell, there is more than one person involved. Although the matter of public importance talks about the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), there is more than one person involved in this whole operation from start to finish. Historically, the unions' position has been to fight for the rights and conditions of workers, for better pay and entitlements, but things seem to have changed in latter times. They are far more involved in political activities and making sure that actions take place at the right time in order to improve any electoral prospects that they might have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, for the first time, we have the ACTU declaring war on Australian industry because for the first time in history they see the writing on the wall and their future somewhat endangered. Individual workers have negotiated better terms and conditions by being contracted to CRA than anything that the ACTU or the Kelty award system could do for them. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today the economics editor said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That's why CRA is prepared to pay these workers more, and why it certainly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">should</EMPHASIS> pay more.</PARA>

<PARA>This strike has nothing to do with the rights of workers to better pay and conditions. It is aimed squarely at the fact that the ACTU has finally found itself in a position of irrelevance in this case and it does not like it because those workers at CRA are getting a better deal without the influence of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add further insult to ordinary Australians, the Prime Minister has failed to condemn the proposed week-long strike that is intended and which will cost the coal industry dearly. </PARA>

<PARA>This proposed strike comes at a time when other sectors are trying to battle out of years and years of financial difficulties. I speak with some knowledge of the difficulties that have occurred in the primary industry sector which, after many years of hardship in some parts of Australia, is just starting to turn around. We might hear of concessions for primary industry, that things will be taken on an individual basis and that there is a possibility that it will not affect primary industry in the same way as it has affected some other industries. But there is no certainty in that. Just at a time when things are starting to turn around and some people are looking like having a chance to get up off their knees, the ACTU moves in to try to kick them down again&mdash;with the apparent blessing of Mr Keating and his Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the people that the Prime Minister says he cares about. We have heard him on television saying that he cares about these people and what is happening to them. But these are the people who will, ultimately, pay the price if this thuggery means that they will not be able to get the expected prices for their products, which are at last becoming available to primary industry and primary producers, because they cannot get them off the wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the government showing leadership in this case? This is another opportunity for the Prime Minister to show how much he cares about the plight of ordinary Australians. But what do we hear? Silence. This series of strikes will cause massive damage to the Australian economy which is already plagued by massive debt. Mr Brereton's comments about the strike being a sign of things to come under a coalition government are just pathetic. This nation is facing a serious crisis and all Mr Brereton can do is try to run down the coalition and deflect any criticism away from himself. It is his set of industrial relations policies and he is the minister. He should set about taking some action, not sit about taking cheap political shots. If this strike goes ahead, it will cost Australia in loss of confidence among overseas markets and consequent long-term loss of trade as Australia becomes known as an unreliable supplier and international importer of goods, and people look to other markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government should be condemned by all Australians who believe in a fair go for all. There is absolutely nothing fair about the strike action that has been condoned by the ACTU. It is not fair on the workers. It is not fair on employers and it is not fair on Australia and the future of Australia. If the union movement in Australia was genuinely concerned about the pay and conditions of workers, it would wholeheartedly support these outcomes of negotiated settlements such as those at CRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions have been watching their memberships fall dramatically over recent years, but the one thing they have failed to see is that not all workers want to be a part of the collective bargaining system. As mentioned by Senator Hill earlier, some 11,000 contracts have been signed by CRA workers. Why have they waited until there are only some 75 contract workers left at Weipa to try to do something about contract workers. I think that speaks for itself. Ultimately, this strike will cost the ACTU and the union movement far more than the employers and the workers that it seeks to attack. It is their marginalisation in industrial relations that is at stake. The one thing that we need to remember is that the unions were not rejected by the company. They were rejected by workers who sought individual contracts for themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do, Senator Herron. Senator Ferguson has just said that the workers at Weipa sought individual contracts. That is completely and utterly wrong. If you know anything about the history of the dispute involving CRA you will know that it was the company that effectively blackmailed a lot of workers into taking huge wage increases and thereby abandoning their award entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, notwithstanding the strength with which people may hold principles, eventually if you offer people enough money you may actually be able to buy those principles off. Of course, you will not always be able to buy everyone's principles off. What we have at Weipa is a number of workers who have held out for some time against this intimidation, against this blackmail, and are seeking to assert their democratic rights to remain members of a union, to have collective bargaining, to have collective representation and to be treated equally and not discriminated against because they adopt that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson also asked: why did the ACTU wait until this time? For your information, this matter has been on foot for well over two years and there have been extensive and lengthy proceedings throughout the industrial courts and commission. All of those proceedings were initiated by the trade union movement. It was seeking to protect the rights of those workers who wanted to remain, who did not want to take up the individual contracts and who sought to resolve this dispute. Throughout that entire period and many lengthy proceedings, the union movement has sought to negotiate a settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, you reach a position where there may be only one action left. No union official&mdash;and I know a lot of them&mdash;wants to see industrial disputation, but eventually you may only have one weapon left. When you talk about industrial thuggery, the real industrial thuggery that has been perpetrated in this country has been the recent actions of the Kennett government in Victoria and the Court government in Western Australia. What you have seen there is governments, in both cases conservative governments, seeking to use legislation to impose a system upon the workers of those states which destroys their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, what did we have in Victoria? We had legislation by the Victorian government which effectively abolished the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria and which abolished the awards which forced all of the trade union organisations and employees to have to make applications back to the commission for registration and to start all over again. They tore up that history of regulation through the Industrial Relations Commission and made everyone start again. In doing so, they made it very patently clear that anybody who sought to maintain a position under the award was going to be discriminated against vis-a-vis those who may end up on individual contracts. Again, that is exactly what has happened in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the approach of conservative right wing governments throughout the world. We saw it in the US during the Reagan years. We saw it in the UK under Thatcher. We have seen it in New Zealand. If you cannot get your way, you tear up the existing legislative framework and impose a new system which clearly discriminates against organised labour and trade unions and drives their conditions and wages down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the philosophy of the coalition? They say we should leave all of this to the marketplace, deregulate industrial relations and abolish the Industrial Relations Commission. But the moment there is an industrial dispute, what do we hear you calling for? We hear you calling for government intervention, but the sort of intervention you want is for government to come in with a big stick and beat the workers and the unions over the head and tell them, `Get back into your place. Don't fight for your wages or to protect your working conditions.' That is the sort of government interference that you want, and that is what real industrial thuggery is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, what has been the approach of the Labor government? The approach has been one of cooperation through the Accord. As Senator Sherry said, you have seen a dramatic decline in the level of industrial disputation in that time. I have checked out the figures on this and in the last period those opposite were in government, back in 1981, in excess of 700 working days were lost per thousand employees. That number declined dramatically to 108 in 1993. Industrial disputes and working days lost now are at an all-time low for the last 40 years in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the record of the Labor government's approach to industrial relations. That is what we have been seeking to have applied throughout this dispute, not the processes of the big stick and not governments coming in and beating unions and workers over the head but rather endeavouring to get the parties back to the negotiating table. It certainly demonstrates that the system can work if there is goodwill on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very pleasing to note that in the developments last night and today the company and the ACTU are heading towards a situation where they will be prepared to sit down and work this matter through. That is what we all hope will happen. That is what should happen. It should never have got to this stage in the first place where a group of workers were going to be discriminated against simply because they wanted to be members of a union and be collectively represented. We also hear Senator Hill talk to us about low wage incomes and the decline in average weekly earnings. That is a complete distortion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to hear Senator Forshaw carry on again about principle. I wonder what the union movement would say if CRA went back to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and said they wanted to do away with the individual contracts that were paying people up to $20,000 a year more and return to the award.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what is going on here has really nothing to do with the rights of workers, of individuals. Instead, what we have here today is the debut of Jennie George as the ACTU president. She needed a big explosion. She needed to burst onto the scene with a bang to let everybody know that she had arrived. What an arrival indeed! Because the consequence of this strike is quite simply this: 32 bulk carriers will be paralysed in east Australian ports if this strike continues&mdash;32 bulk carriers will either be tied up, incapable of getting out of port or incapable of getting into port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anybody in this chamber or elsewhere does not believe that figure, my office has been phoning every bulk carrier terminal in Australia on the east coast today and these are the facts: in Gladstone one ship is ready to go; in Hay Point five ships are ready to load; at the Dalrymple coal terminal two ships are due tonight; at the Abbott Point coal terminal one ship is due tomorrow; at Port Waratah coal two ships are currently loading, two ships are ready to load and nine further ships are due to anchor by 21 November; at Port Kembla there was one strike affected arrival today, two ships are ready to load and one further ship is due tonight; and at the Queensland sugar terminals six ships are currently loading, which of course will also be strikebound and incapable of getting out of port. That is a total of 32 bulk carriers on the east coast alone. </PARA>

I take the opportunity to draw to honourable senators' attention a press statement issued today by the Port of Brisbane that said that eight vessels were likely to be affected by the strike action. Some were already in port. For example, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tasman Venture</EMPHASIS> is due to depart at four o'clock this afternoon. Other ships like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">OOCO Educator</EMPHASIS> are due to come into port. They will not get into port because of this action.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a member of the Archives Advisory Council since its inception, as has Mr Colin Hollis from the House of Representatives. The Archives is an institution in which I take a great interest. I wish to say a few words this afternoon about this report and the work of the archives. In doing so I refer initially to the mission statement of the archives referred to at the beginning of the report. It says: `to preserve valuable Commonwealth records as part of the archival resources of Australia, and make them accessible to present and future generations'. Then it talks about how they would set out to achieve that mission statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the greatest respect for the director and the staff of the Archives. I think we have an archives second to none in the world in the work that it has done. There are a few things that I would like it to be more involved in than it is. It is not fault of the Archives that it is not. I refer to retaining census records. I personally believe that the census records are an enormously important part of Australia's history and heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret the destruction of records that has taken place to date. I reject the concept that people would not give accurate information if they thought it was to be kept. In fact, there may be part of the records which could be dispensed with. But I believe there is other valuable information which should be retained for historians and Australians in the future to be able to have access to social information about the country and the way that it is functioning. I just mention that in passing as one thing that I would really like the Archives to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people seem to think the keeping of Commonwealth records, archives, is pretty boring and dull. But that is until they understand what it comprises. If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Archives repository at Mitchell or in any of the states you will, I suggest, be astounded and amazed at the valuable material and information stored there&mdash;not just documents, many of which in the end may well be destroyed as not relevant to be kept, but so much material which is of enormous value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mission statement I read out, I referred to the keeping of these records to make them accessible to present and future generations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that, as yet, we still do not have an archives building in the parliamentary triangle. I see it as being a building which is important to be in the parliamentary triangle, like the National Library, the High Court, the Art Gallery&mdash;those great buildings which are there already. I really do look forward to being at the opening of the archives building at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Archives has put on many exhibitions in recent times, which senators no doubt have seen, mainly in the Old Parliament House. They have been great exhibitions and those that were held during the year under consideration are referred to in the report. But, in my view, that is not the place for them to be held. They should be in an archives building and they should be able to travel, as some of these do. But there is such a wealth of material that has been collected that should be made more readily available, not just to those who apply to get it out for the purpose of research but also to the rest of us so that we can see things on display and have a greater appreciation of the heritage of this country. </PARA>

I know that Treasury and Finance, whilst they are being refurbished, are to move in there after Foreign Affairs has moved out. Hopefully after that, if no building has been made available for the Archives, there will be an opportunity for them to be given that building as an archives building to be used for the work that they do and for the sorts of displays of material that they have so that it will become available. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times the High Court of Australia has come down and supported the view being put by people such as me that the signing of an international treaty does impact on domestic law. That High Court decision is referred to as the Teoh decision. There is currently a bill before us to deal with the High Court decision which basically says that if a federal government signs an international treaty it is appropriate for the people of Australia to anticipate that the terms of that treaty will impact on domestic law and that the citizens of Australia have a right to rely on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see how the Australian government deals with international treaty making. Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I come from Tasmania. We had a situation late last year, about this time last year, when our state government's legislation was overridden by the federal government legislating on the basis of the federal government having an international obligation and that it had to legislate; it had an international duty to legislate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Isn't it amazing that when the High Court makes a ruling that the federal government has an international obligation to apply international treaties to the federal government's domestic law, the federal government runs into this parliament with legislation to override the international treaty. It does not want the international treaties affecting its laws. If it can affect Tasmanian laws, the federal government has this international treaty responsibility. It says, `We will beat our collective chest and we will say we have to override the Tasmanian parliament.' If it happens to override federal law, the Labor Party won't have a bar of it. That shows the hypocrisy and the duplicity of the government in dealing with international treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of concern to a number of people. I know that at this very moment, as I am speaking, colleagues of mine are meeting in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, which is dealing with the external affairs power. A very lengthy and detailed report will be presented. I am sure it will be of great assistance to the people of Australia when it is brought down, hopefully later this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is running short. The brief contribution I sought to make was to highlight yet again the way the federal government approaches, in a very ad hoc way, the process of treaty making within this country and the hypocritical way that it approaches treaty making. When it is for its benefit, it will use the international obligation argument to override the states. When the international obligation argument overrides the federal government, it quickly introduces countervailing legislation. </PARA>

It has been a great honour to serve on a body which is one of the national icons in the parliamentary triangle, which Senator Reid was discussing earlier this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This institution is in some ways misnamed because it is certainly more than a library. It is a repository of the cultural heritage of Australia; it is not just an institution full of books.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the unique features of the National Library as an institution is its use of devices such as oral history. This is where they bring in very famous people and get them to discuss on an audio record the events of their life. This becomes a priceless treasure for future researchers. Imagine if we had the records of what people had said back in the last century about the events that were happening in that century. Of course, we do not have that, but we do have it for the 20th century for people of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The papers of famous people are collected, sorted and stored. Again this is a great repository for future research.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Library is the leader of Australian libraries. It undertakes a great many activities to assist the development of those libraries. It has the distributed national collection. This means that all the materials are not located in Canberra but are moved out on occasions to other places around the country. People in the major cities of Australia and in regional areas can access that material a lot easier when the National Library goes on the road. </PARA>

The National Portrait Gallery in Old Parliament House is under the control of the Australian National Library. In the last two years I have been delighted to see a number of the exhibitions that they have mounted. This has become a major attraction for tourism in Canberra. There was one exhibition on political portraiture, including the cartooning of Australian politicians over the years. This was a fascinating exhibition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new technology that is developing across the country with the information superhighway has given the National Library a new impetus in terms of distributing its materials across the nation.

The VLW short-wave transmitter at Carnarvon was closed down because it was too old and it was unserviceable. It used to carry the normal ABC programs out to those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That transmitter was 30 years old and it would take only $1 million to replace it. In the budget of this government or any other government, $1 million is a very minimal amount to service an area as high in producing income for Australia as this area is. It has all the iron ore, various other mining enterprises, the pastoral industry, Aboriginal communities and so on. But this government sees fit not to give them a basic radio service. What reminded me was that during the week a question was asked of Senator Collins, I think, regarding Radio Australia transmission of programs into Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a supporter of Radio Australia broadcasting overseas. It is a very worthwhile service even if it is only for the few Australians who are overseas. The point is that we have our own people living not far from Indonesia who do not have that basic radio service. That is inexcusable in this day and age. The argument I get from the government is that people can buy an earth station. You can buy an earth station for about $2,000 and set it up via the satellite and in that way pick up the ABC radio service. But that is loading $2,000 onto a station, a mining camp, a private household, or whatever, and it is totally ridiculous. People are entitled to have this service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if you do want to go down that line you cannot use an earth station as a mobile unit when you are on the move. You cannot put one on the back of your utility or on a roof of your car and tour around with it because it has to be set up to face the satellite. This system does not operate on a ship, either. It is no good in most places because of movement. For the simple cost of $1 million this government can switch back this basic radio service to that area. Senator Abetz mentioned Triple J and all the other FM radio stations in the high population areas of Australia. We know that the SBS service is available throughout most of Australia. There are some areas of the country yet to be covered by SBS, but it is getting around the nation. </PARA>

Even when a minister of the crown falls foul of the legislation, unfortunately the taxpayer has to foot the bill. That is not the situation with the hundreds of thousands of small businesses right around this country who face these claims and, as a result, are put to considerable expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But worse than providing an overload to the commission and to the registry and adding cost to small business, it is proving to be a positive disincentive to small business to employ new staff, because they are so concerned that they may well, if they find the need to dismiss someone, fall foul of the legislation. It is so very easily done, as Mr Sciacca himself has shown to this parliament and to the nation with the unfair dismissal claim against his office. There have just been so many&mdash;literally thousands and thousands&mdash;of these unfair dismissal claims made in recent times that there is this huge backlog, and claims are being delayed. Of course, justice delayed is justice denied to so many of the small business operators who have to face these claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem as to why the commission is facing so many of these claims is that, even if a spurious claim is made and is finally dismissed, there is no way that the small business person can then reclaim the costs associated with defending the claim. Therefore, often the small business operator, after the matter has been in the Industrial Relations Commission and in the registry for a while, makes the decision to pay a few thousand dollars to the worker just to get rid of the case, although the operator would have won it. For the small business operator to have defended the matter in the industrial relations system and win it may well have cost them $5,000 or $6,000 but they could not then claim the costs against the person who brought the action. So, from a commercial decision point of view, they take the view that it would be a lot better to pay some small amount of money, which, of course, is an unfair bonus to the person bringing the spurious claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With the legislation that will soon be before us, I trust that the workload of the Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry will get back to normal, that these outrageous claims and the outrageously high number of claims for unfair dismissal will be reduced and that the legislation will then ensure that people, even such as Mr Sciacca, do not find themselves in breach of their own legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read some of the report and skimmed through the rest with some interest. It does make interesting reading. However, I want to confine my remarks today to a matter that I have raised a number of times in this parliament, dealing with the surveillance carried out by the Coastwatch branch of the Customs Service in so far as it relates to the Torres Strait Islands and Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am still concerned, in spite of a number of issues that have hit the headlines in recent months, that there is still very minimal staff in the Customs Service in that area of Australia. I think eight or nine customs officers out of a total of 4,500 are stationed in that area. The significance of the Torres Strait and Far North Queensland is that it is the border of Australia that is closest to a foreign country. One of the islands in the Torres Strait, Saibai Island, is just a matter of a stone's throw from the mainland coast of Papua New Guinea. It is really just a short distance across the narrow stretch of water to get to Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guinea does not have the same sorts of quarantine regulations and it does not have the same sort of law enforcement that we have in Australia. It is perhaps the most vulnerable part of the Australian coastline because it is so near to another country. Yet, in spite of recent occurrences and in spite of warnings that I have raised in the parliament&mdash;warnings that, I might say, have been treated by the minister with some disdain and laughter; he seems to think it is a laughing matter usually&mdash;I am very concerned about it, because I, like you, Madam Acting Deputy President, come from that area. You and I actually live closer to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea than we do to Canberra, so things that happen there are of fairly great concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that recently there has been a change in the Coastwatch contract up there. My friend and colleague Senator MacGibbon did, in fact, put some penetrating questions on notice to the minister earlier this year&mdash;answers to which have been given not long ago, and some of those answers will be closely investigated. There are a few things there that I think may well deserve greater scrutiny from this parliament, and that is something we can look at, but the fact that there are only eight or nine customs officers in that area out of a total of some 4,500 is of some concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in the report that there are some details of border administration and drug seizures in 1993-94 and 1994-95. As I read them, the seizures in 1994-95 increased quite dramatically in relation to cannabis. In 1993-94, the number seized was 1,038 and the weight was 50.8 kilos. In 1994-95, there were 1,091 seizures, but the weight was 6,449.7 kilos. I suspect, without having been able to locate this in the report, that that probably relates to that aircraft full of drugs which was apprehended at Bamaga. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason I raise that is to say that the reason that aircraft was apprehended was not because of customs surveillance, not because of the watching capability through Cape York, but because people in Mackay reported that someone had purchased a plane with cash notes. That is what put the authorities onto it. My concern is that that aircraft full of drugs came right past Thursday Island and Horn Island, landed at Bamaga, dropped someone off, I think, and went back to Thursday Island and came back to Bamaga. I am not sure of the actual details, but it was a bit of a Keystone Cops sort of thing. It went close to the surveillance points and was not apprehended. That is what my concern is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have more detailed concerns, which I do not have time to relate now, and one of them is the Queensland's government's proposal to block off sections of Cape York.

<PARA>That was a damming attack, by one of the industry's most prominent figures and a member of the government's own inquiry, on the government's treatment of the wine industry. Of course, three weeks after those comments by Mr Croser, the government finally released the report on the wine industry on 2 November, with the government's response&mdash;over four months after the report was given to the government and while the industry was going through an enormous period of uncertainty and all investment had been put on hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government went on a parade down to the marginal Labor seat of Kingston, to a winery in that seat, where Mr Bilney and Mr Willis announced that the government would not increase the tax on wine any further than it already had. And I suppose the industry and the people in my state of South Australia should be grateful for small mercies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the move by the government does not hide the fact that there has been a very significant increase in tax on this industry in the last two years, and it certainly should not give anybody any confidence that a re-elected Labor government&mdash;God forbid&mdash;would not increase the tax after the election. The government's treatment of this industry has been dreadful. The tax on wine has increased by one-third since the last election, despite the government's having spent the last election campaign running around the country attacking our proposition for a GST and leaving voters with the not unreasonable presumption that the government was opposed to any further increases in indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then, of course, not long after the election, we had that infamous 1993 budget, which destroyed this government's credibility forever, in which the wine tax was increased from 20 per cent to 32 per cent&mdash;over a 50 per cent increase in the level of tax on wine. We indicated that we would strenuously oppose that ridiculously massive increase on this industry, and the government negotiated a compromise, with the agreement of the Democrats, to bring the tax back to 26 per cent. But that represented a one-third increase in the tax on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry has been a great Australian success story. With exports and growth, it has been doing very well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has just happened to another South Australian industry: a very successful product called Two Dogs lemonade has just had a massive increase in tax placed on it by this federal Labor government.

<PARA>This document reports on the work of NBEET. I want to speak in particular about the work of one of the councils of NBEET, which is the Schools Council. A key aspect of the council's role is educational accountability for the moneys spent by the Commonwealth government in the schools sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ALP government has set a very poor record in this area. This came out earlier this year when the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee carried out a major study into accountability of the spending of Commonwealth funds. We heard evidence from right around Australia, and what it revealed were some very poor mechanisms of accountability as set up by the Commonwealth government. It has a great focus on inputs. But what you need, if you are to truly measure accountability, is a focus on outputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government does, after having done its measures, is to put out an authorised certificate saying that the funds have being spend adequately. But how does it know what its effects are? How does it know if the money is being spent properly and in accordance with the proper objectives of education? By measuring inputs, you do not know that. What you have to do is measure outputs. Poor federal accountability does not allow us to say whether we are basing our policy decisions for the future on the real needs of the students in our schools. We need much more work to be done on developing effective mechanisms for measuring educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have identified data on inputs, the dollars spent, extra teachers and new programs. But that does not tell you how effective the system is. It reminds me a little of a program in America which was called `Headstart'. The Americans spent $1 billion on the program. It was to help disadvantaged children. But they had no way of measuring how effective the expenditure was. That was in the 1970s in America. Here we are in the nineties in Australia, and we are still using the same inadequate types of measures&mdash;measures that do not measure educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another role of the government in terms of Commonwealth funding is, where it sees a need, to target particular programs around Australia into which state governments are not putting sufficient funding. This is an admirable concept. But when you come to an area such as the needs of the gifted and talented, this government amazingly&mdash;amazingly, especially after the speech by Mr Hawke in which he said we need to create the clever country&mdash;spent in the last two years, per annum, the grand total of $1 million across Australia on gifted and talented children. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a report from a Senate committee in 1987 that came down stating that there were 17 things that the Commonwealth needed to do in the area of the gifted and talented&mdash;17 recommendations. The government acted on one minor recommendation. This is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago the government decided that it would spend a little bit in this area. It was too ideologically blinkered to go beyond spending gifted and talented money on children from socially and economically disadvantaged families. Doing that is fine. But what about the rest of the children in this country who are gifted and talented? Why does this government disadvantage them by not putting in proper funding? The government set up that three-year program, and the miserable sum of $1 million a year was cut this year&mdash;the government has cut it out totally; it is not spending anything in the next year on gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have an organisation by NBEET, it really should be overseeing what are our national priorities. It is not accounting properly for the money that is spent on education; it does not know its outcomes. And when we get to an area like gifted and talented children, it is doing nothing at all. That makes this government a national disgrace. It certainly makes a total mockery of any claim the government makes of developing `the clever country'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see the islands and see some of the difficulties under which they operate. Some of the difficulties which became very obvious to me were the provision of water and effluent disposal and also, on some of the islands, the airstrips, which are really the only means of communication and of travel in the islands&mdash;and certainly travel that should be available at all times is by aircraft. The day I landed at Saibai Island it had been raining and we landed on a short strip that was unsealed and full of potholes and puddles of water. It was quite an interesting experience to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The formation of the Torres Strait Regional Authority is the correct way to go. I say this in my capacity as a Queensland senator, I might say, not that this area of policy is one in which I have any particular authority. As a Queensland senator I think that the formation of the authority was the appropriate way to go. I am confident that we can expect to see a lot of progress in the Torres Strait Islands as the years progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the authority will have to look at is the continuing education in the islands. Again, I was privileged to attend some of the schools on the islands. I was on Yorke Island when the kids were practising for a festival in the following week. It was tremendous to see the way the kids are learning, becoming part of the community in which they live and also learning very important roles that will assist them through their lives. Some teachers explained to me, though, a concern about some of the children who had been doing very well in the island schools leaving the islands. When they reached 12, 13 and 14 and went to the mainland, they came under the influence of less desirable elements in that community and lost a lot of the training benefits and the purpose they had in life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see that there are now schools in the major northern cities, like the Emmanuel College that I visited in Cairns recently, which are really trying to bridge the gap when the islander, Aboriginal and Anglo-Saxon children of that age group leave primary school and sometimes go astray. It is good to see places like the Emmanuel College playing a role by trying to ensure that these children do get a start in life that will enable them to lead productive and rewarding lives in the future. I hope to say a bit more on that matter on the adjournment debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to briefly touch on the economic program of the TSRA. I note that one of their business funding schemes is to provide concessional finance in loans and guarantees to islanders to help them acquire and develop commercially successful businesses. I have been corresponding with Mr Tickner about a Mr Adrian Bon from the Bac-Ed Pamas Store on Thursday Island. He has had to borrow money from a bank and he is trying to get a better guarantee and a better deal from the TSRA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The all-party working group reconvened in June 1994 and presented a draft code of conduct in June of this year, one year later. Until now, regrettably, we have not debated the merits or otherwise of that draft code. During the last session I tabled amendments which the Democrats believe will strengthen that draft code. That is what we are talking about now. Those amendments are open to discussion and further amendment. I hope that this debate will bring out constructive suggestions for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth revisiting a little of the history. I mentioned the Bowen committee of 1979. The next thing that is worth noting are the events of 1986 and 1987, when the debate focused almost solely on the need for a register of pecuniary interests for senators and members. In October 1989 Democrat Senator Michael Macklin gave notice of motion to set up a joint select committee on the political behaviour of parliamentarians. The government and the opposition rejected that motion in 1989, relying on the argument that we, as members of parliament, are already aware of the political standards expected of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1991, after the New South Wales Independent Committee Against Corruption suggested that the New South Wales parliament develop a code of conduct for its members, Ted Mack MP asked in the federal parliament whether the Commonwealth government would take up that suggestion as well. In May 1991 Prime Minister Hawke took steps to establish a working group to look at the matter. That working group did not meet until October, after the so-called Marshall Islands affair and after a further Democrat motion calling on the working group to be convened as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another two years elapsed. In 1993, after the critical Auditor-General's report on the administration by the then sports minister, Ros Kelly, of the sporting grants program, the Democrats won agreement from the government, in March last year, to reconvene that working group as part of a package of accountability measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that, in the last 20 years, along with so many other changes in Australia, it does seem the rules of politics have changed as well and that the conventions of the past are either no longer relevant or are ignored. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree with you. Some contemporary examples would include the tough it out at all costs model of ministerial responsibility. The questionable use of royal commissions is equally a contemporary example. Subjects such as the pressure of the cost of modern campaigning, the fact that someone in a public relations firm thought sponsorship of federal cabinet was probably okay to try as a fund-raising tool, suggest to all of us that the lines in 1995 are quite blurred and that we need to challenge them and clarify them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments I have suggested in the motion that we are debating draw on recommendations by the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission and from the code suggested by the British Nolan committee report on standards in public life. The key changes seek to strengthen the responsiveness of parliamentarians to the community for their behaviour; to require parliamentarians to avoid placing themselves under financial or other obligations which could affect decision making; and to ensure the primacy of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to some of the changes I have added. I come to the first matter in the working group's draft. No. 1 has as its title `Loyalty to the Nation and Regard for its Laws'. To that I have added `and its System of Government', because I think it is very important to spell out that members of parliament should act with respect towards the institutions of parliament and should ensure that their conduct, whether in a personal or an official capacity, does not bring parliament into disrepute or damage public confidence in the system of government. That is what I think is important: public confidence in the system of government. We are talking about this parliament and this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example I give is in the working party's draft code. Under the heading `Integrity' it simply says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members and Senators must at all times . . . strive to maintain the public trust placed in them, and advance the common good of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that should be further spelt out. I think we should say, `Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading of `Primacy of the Public Interest', which again I think is too general and too vague, I seek to add, `Members and senators should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest and in carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts or recommending individuals for rewards or benefits, should make objective choices on merit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current draft code does not deal with the issue of enforcement of the standards. I think that must be a key issue if this process is to succeed. Too often governments seek to defend their own, regardless of the evidence, and too often oppositions seek to make political mileage without necessarily searching for the truth. That is one of the end results of a party political system. It is a natural result. It is the context in which we operate. I do not think it is necessarily the best one, but it is the context we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But often we go too far. In the defence of our own or in the pursuit of our opponents, I think we lose sight of how we are behaving and how we are perceived. Something is needed to ensure that in the main our behaviour as members of parliament reflects the values and expectations of the community at large. Parliamentarians need to know that, if their behaviour is deemed unethical, they will be investigated by independent, impartial officers and then brought to account through proper parliamentary procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be really easy to say, `This is all just the nature of politics,' and do nothing about it. It is not just politicians who are held in low regard by Australians. I cite the media, banks and lawyers. But the fact that we are held in such low regard often discourages many who would otherwise consider doing so from standing for parliament. It sets an example to young Australians that certain kinds of behaviour are not just acceptable but the norm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we, as federal parliamentarians, have in our hands the opportunity to do something about it. So I have proposed reforms to parliamentary procedures, firstly, to establish a joint house ethics committee to develop and enforce the code of conduct and, secondly, to establish a parliamentary commissioner of standards to undertake impartial and factual investigation of any allegations or breaches of the code. I have circulated details of how both these bodies would operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these will provide the teeth that will make the code of conduct stick. We do need to do something to help restore confidence in the parliamentary processes and in parliamentarians by providing the community not just with one avenue of complaint but with input into the development of standards of conduct and the process of enforcement. In my ethics committee no political party would have a majority, but the balance of power would be held by four community representatives. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Yesterday, the Senate debated the suitability of Dr Carmen Lawrence, a person found by a royal commission to have lied and to have acted improperly, to hold office as the Minister for Human Services and Health. How would you expect the Democrats to react, how would you expect a party committed to keeping the bastards honest to respond in this case? Let me tell you how they did. Democrat Leader, Senator Kernot, stood up in this place and criticised the new political morality under Labor adding that `the entire episode has brought parliament and politicians into even further disrepute'. But her indignation and her outrage lasted only until the division bells. At that point, she and her colleagues sided with the government and, in so doing, confirmed that dishonest and improper behaviour by a minister is acceptable to the Democrats. It is not, and never will be, acceptable to the federal coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of yesterday's charade, the Democrats are today asking the Senate to consider a series of amendments to the so-called code of conduct for members and senators. They are amendments, they say, that will strengthen the principles of the code. But I ask the Democrats: why bother to strengthen the principles when you refuse to use your basic parliamentary vote to condemn the actions of Dr Lawrence? On one day the Australian Democrats vote against their so-called principles&mdash;as they did yesterday&mdash;and the next day, today, Senator Spindler comes into this place at question time and asks probing questions about Dr Lawrence's legal fees for her cover-up actions. Come on, get real, why not act on principle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that the Democrats do not have a monopoly on morals in this place. The need for a code of conduct originated in April 1991 when the independent member Ted Mack in the other place asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time whether he would initiate the development of such a code. The Prime Minister subsequently asked the Presiding Officers to establish a parliamentary working group and the matter rested until the Marshall Islands affair involving former Senator Graeme Richardson broke in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The furore subsided and the matter stalled again. Then, in 1994, Ros Kelly hit the headlines over her administration of funds under the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program. The working group was reconvened and the work on the codes began in ernest. At this point, I would prefer to say that public trust and confidence in the institution of parliament was restored but that would ignore the subsequent controversies over Graeme Richardson's book, Alan Griffiths and Dr Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the cross-party parliamentary working party included a cabinet minister, Senator Robert Ray; his Labor colleague Senator Jim McKiernan, who I note will speak today; the Democrat Senator Vicki Bourne, who I note will not be speaking today&mdash;she has obviously been gazumped by her leader; the Greens Senator Christabel Chamarette; the Independent member Ted Mack; as well as Liberal and National Party representatives including Senator Reid, Ian Sinclair and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called codes of conduct are in reality two sets of principles that set minimum standards of behaviour for members of parliament, ministers and Presiding Officers. These principles do not and cannot prescribe or legislate for integrity or honesty but send an important message to the people of Australia that we share their concerns about abuses of parliamentary standards. Here we must ask the important question: why is it that today's Democrat motion addresses only the draft framework of ethical principles for members and senators with a number of amendments that they have brought forward when, at the same time, the Democrat motion ignores the companion document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A framework of ethical principles for ministers and Presiding Officers</EMPHASIS>? Is this just another example of the cosy relationship between the Democrats and the ALP&mdash;pious preaching and feather duster politics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The omission again reveals the hypocrisy and cowardice of the Australian Democrats. What a shame that Senator Kernot's team has shown up as opportunists and lacking in consistency or fibre of character. Why isn't Senator Vicki Bourne, the member who participated in the development of these codes of conduct, participating here today in this debate? She has obviously been nobbled by Senator Kernot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is academic to ask whether the implementation of such codes of conduct would have prevented or limited the damage inflicted on the integrity of this parliament in recent years. But it is appropriate to look at how the code would work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the so-called sandwich affair which involved then minister Alan Griffiths and led to the Prime Minister establishing an inquiry to examine: firstly, whether there was any conflict between Mr Griffiths's private interests and the performance of his public duties; and, secondly, whether he authorised or condoned any inappropriate, improper or illegal activities by any of his staff in relation to the conduct of his private interests. The inquiry found that there had been no direct conflict or personal breach, but:</PARA>

<PARA>And, in relation to three specific matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the inquiry finds errors of judgment and/or a want of diligence.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is Young in the Combe-Ivanov affair, Young in the Paddington Bear affair, Dawkins in the mother's shares affair, Young in the election donation affair, Richardson in the radio 2HD affair, Richardson in the Marshall Islands affair, Kelly in the sports program affair and Collins in the pay TV affair. I might remind Minister Collins of the Senate select committee's report into the pay TV affair which called for a `form of guidelines against which a minister's exercise of responsibility can be assessed'. Those guidelines now exist on paper. The specific code for ministers and Presiding Officers reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers and the Presiding Officers are responsible for the competence with which they handle their public duties, the relevant actions of their personal staff and their departments, and their personal conduct insofar as it affects their public role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to action taken by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, each House of the Parliament may consider matters raised by Members and Senators under this framework and a majority of two thirds of Members of a House will be necessary to resolve a matter.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth speculating how Dr Carmen Lawrence&mdash;and her memory&mdash;would stack up against just two of the principles outlined by the parliamentary working group:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honesty. Ministers and the Presiding Officers must be frank and honest in their public dealings and in particular must not mislead intentionally the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently by a Minister or Presiding Officer must be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use of Influence. Ministers and their Presiding Officers must not exercise the influence obtained from their public office to further their personal interests, obtain any improper advantage or benefit for themselves or another, or any promise of future advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, the codes of conduct are long overdue. For too long we, as elected representatives, have allowed the sins of a few to undermine the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of the parliamentary institution. The two sets of principles&mdash;one for senators and members and the other for ministers and Presiding Officers&mdash;are integrally linked in and to this parliament. Today, the Australian Democrats are attempting to separate them, to pull out the one which embarrasses them and look only at the one over which they want to make some publicity and some pious dealings and ignore the other one that is currently causing embarrassment to the Australia Labor Party. They stand condemned. The credibility and reputation of the Australian Democrats has been wrecked by their crass and flawed approach to this important issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you go through that list of names, I now find it amazing on reflection that the committee actually got as far as it did in developing a draft for discussion by this parliament on a framework of ethical principles for ministers and presiding officers and a similar document for members and senators. All of us who served on the working party come from diverse backgrounds and, indeed, have diverse political experiences. Some of us have been in parliament a little time; while others have served at cabinet level, very high office level, in the governments of the country, both present and past. </PARA>

I am from the Labor Party, like some of my colleagues; others on the working group represent the Liberal and National parties as well as Senator Vicki Bourne from the Democrats and Senator Christabel Chamarette from the Greens. We approached this matter from a whole range of political perspectives and we have got some degree of unanimity of where we go. In the working group, from my recollection, we did not say, `We are here developing a bible which will be the be-all and end-all for the behaviour of all members and senators in this parliament.' What we did come up with&mdash;in the circumstances I think they are two very good documents&mdash;were frameworks for further deliberation and further discussion by the House of Representatives and by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is not new. It is not&mdash;as Senator Tambling said&mdash;something that arose in recent times in that, all of a sudden and out of the blue, there was a need for a code of conduct for members of parliament and for senators. The need for a code of conduct has been in existence ever since a parliamentary democratic system of government evolved, and that is now some thousands of years ago. Indeed, various codes of conduct have evolved within that period of time. I have only been in this parliament a relatively short time, but already we are getting closer to agreement on a code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very significant things that has happened in my lifetime in this parliament is the fact that a register of senators' interests came into existence in the Senate. It was not in existence when I came into the parliament in 1984, but it is here now, and it was this chamber that decided it would come into existence. For all the high moral ground that Senator Tambling seeks to take here in the chamber this afternoon on the amendments proposed by Senator Kernot and on the draft framework that the working group presented to the parliament earlier this year, I do have to remind him that his side of the parliament opposed that register of senators' interests, as indeed his side of the parliament opposed a similar sort of register to register the interests of members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason why I paid tribute to the working group and exclaimed some surprise that we actually reached the position that we reached is because of some of what Senator Tambling had to say.

A member of the working group, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, got himself into trouble. Neither Mr MacKellar nor Mr Sinclair were mentioned in Senator Tambling's contribution here this afternoon. The reason why he did not mention them is that he is part of that political side of the parliament that they are all part of, and they will support their own, as indeed there would be an expectation on this side of the parliament that we in turn would be supporting colleagues from this side of the chamber. I know that Senator Sherry on the front bench would probably want to be making some interjections about the behaviour of one Mr Robin Gray, who was not, of course, mentioned by Senator Tambling in his contribution here this afternoon. </PARA>

However, it is like a group of murderers sitting around discussing how to dispose of the corpse. After yesterday's politicised debate on Dr Lawrence, there can be no doubt that values and ethics in politics are dead. A new politics which rests firmly on the values of the community will not be born of measures like a code of conduct. Codes, rules, orders, resolutions, determinations or guidelines cannot ensure that politicians act with propriety if the system in which they operate strips them of their own personal values when they enter it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By far the worst assailant of values is party politics. The supremacy of the party over personal conscience, parliament, accountability, and ultimately community values like honesty, is the root of the ethical malaise. I used to wonder why, when backbenchers came in for divisions, they just asked which side they should go on instead of what they were voting about. I now know why, because sometimes their consciences would be extremely disturbed if they did know what they were voting for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the system needs to change. The roots are fed by the competition for power, position and remuneration. And, ultimately, the constant suppression of personal beliefs to party beliefs leads to the loss of those beliefs altogether. One cannot maintain beliefs the validity of which one constantly denies. Political expediency, fed by the desire for electoral survival, perpetuates the problem. </PARA>

I have a belief that a politician is as out of date as the length of time they have been in parliament. Therefore, I am now three years out of date. I derive this example from my background in the prison system, where people, because they were separated from the ordinary community and had to learn to survive in the new rules, when they left prison were out of touch; a part of them had stopped growing. I think the same has happened to politicians. That is why we cannot retain leadership. It is the community that is ahead of the politicians right now at this point in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The path to an ethical parliament is paved by a breaking down of the power of the party system, by bringing in proportional representation to get a better reflection of the community, by conscience voting and by a tying together of personal commitment, social purpose and spiritual meaning with the day-to-day requirements of a parliamentarian's role.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A growing trend throughout Western society is to divorce our work from our hearts; to quarantine what we do from what we believe. I quote an excerpt from a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Soul of Politics</EMPHASIS> by Jim Wallis, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our intuition tells us the depth of the crisis we face demands more than politics as usual. An illness of the spirit has spread across the land, and our greatest need is for what our religious traditions call "the healing of the nations." The fundamental character of the social, economic, and cultural renewal we urgently need will require a change of both our hearts and our minds. But that change will demand a new kind of politics&mdash;a politics with spiritual values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several decades ago, Mohandas K. Gandhi warned against what he called the seven social sins. He named them as politics without principle, wealth without work, commerce without morality, pleasure without conscience, education without character, science without humanity, and worship without sacrifice. These social sins today provide an apt description of our leading institutions and cultural patterns; they are the accepted practices of the life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>There may be an accountability role for a broad enunciation of principles and mechanisms for making parliamentarians account for their actions. It was very valuable being on the committee that crossed all party boundaries to try to look at this problem. Certainly, changes to our processes to increase independence and reduce the adversarial nature would also be beneficial. However, without addressing the fundamental lack of personal values in the political system, any code's existence is simply window dressing on a bomb site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens support the work of the Democrats in bringing this issue into political debate and also support the release of the discussion paper. It is healthy for this debate to occur both inside and outside parliament. While we believe that this attempt to strengthen the framework of ethical principles for members and senators will not solve the  problems we face, it will improve what already exists and as such is a step forward. We will support this motion, but ask all senators to look into their hearts and at their actions and judge for themselves their conduct. As feminism so rightly declares, we cannot ignore that the personal is the political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by referring to a wonderful article by Matthew Fox entitled `Deep politics and grace'. He says that the 15th century is when the modern era of politics began&mdash;it is not so modern after all. It started with the invention of the printing press and the introduction of Machiavelli's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Prince</EMPHASIS>. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to this time, the theory of politics from the Middle Ages and from Aristotle was that a politician was a person of virtue who led people virtuously. But Machiavelli secularized politics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of talking about virtues of justice, for example, Machiavelli said that rules of politics should be whatever is appropriate to the situation and leads to success. He said that growth and expansion is more important than justice and constitutes the law of life. He came up with the image of what we call today the modern state.</PARA>
<PARA>Do we recognise this in the way our political system operates because if we do not we are blind as well as deaf. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The movement from modern to postmodern is the movement from honoring an ego or political "star" to people empowering themselves. From ego-centric (which is always anthropocentric) to omnicentric. It is the movement from "politics as usual" to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">deep politics</EMPHASIS>. It is the resurrection of community passion, including moral outrage at the Babylon of modern politics around the world. Deep politics is also the passion of what we really do believe in. It moves politics from game playing to the lower chakras where pain and sorrow and survival dwell. Moving politics from secularization (anthropocentric) to sacralization (holding all sacred) is the work of postmodern politics. We humans are the only species that can choose to cut ourselves off from the sacred: we have done it in politics; we've done it in science; we've done it in education; and we've done it religion and in art. This is why we elders of our society are building prisons for our young people instead of giving them spiritual opportunities. The modern world has been very hostile to the experience of the sacred. Even the churches and synagogues have run from it and have tried to sell us religion instead of awakening our spiritual empowerment. So this phrase <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">deep politics</EMPHASIS> is a turning point in four hundred years of modern politics in society and church.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that will be an inspiration for us when looking at any discussion paper or code of conduct because unless we embody it in the way we work then it will be, as I said before, window dressing on a bomb site. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the committee involved in the development of the code of conduct, which was tabled by the Presiding Officers earlier this year. I was very pleased to be a part of it and look at the papers and documents which came to us. I support the code which has been presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a realistic document but I actually believe that a piece of paper will not make the slightest bit of difference to a person who is going to be dishonest and untruthful because they will probably rationalise what is in it in relation to their own behaviour and conduct. In the end, the electorate deals with all of us at regular intervals and is able to judge the sorts of people we are and the way we behave and conduct ourselves in the offices we hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do recognise the reason for having the document, and I want to go through a little of the background of what the committee did in coming to the conclusion it did in presenting the document to the parliament. We considered a number of other codes of conduct that had been drafted before in considerable detail: the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Committee draft code, the Bowen committee report that has been referred to, and a draft code suggested by the Hon. Kevin Rozzoli. We read and looked at all of those documents in considerable detail and found a number of things in them that were good and a number which we regarded as inappropriate for what we were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a draft brought to us which in a sense took into account the proposals in the documents that I have mentioned and we spent some time analysing it. We found within it a number of things which were so subjective that we felt it was not reasonable to bring them to the parliament. I will come to it shortly but I think the same arguments apply to a number of things that Senator Kernot has put in her amendments to our draft code, which are before us this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also gave the public, institutions and groups an opportunity to contribute. It was interesting to read through a resume of some of the submissions that came before us. One suggested that members should have at least one day a month when people can make an appointment to speak directly to them and comment about the conduct of question time and speeches. One said that the code must be expressed in clear English and be easily translated into the language of ethnic minorities, should be brief and therefore easily readable and must be issued to all politicians before they take up office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one suggested that any code must protect the independence of all members of parliament and that restraints on members should be kept to a minimum. Another one was that all dorothy dix questions should be discontinued&mdash;that would make a difference, wouldn't it? They were some of the things we had before us. In addition to the Bowen code I referred to, we looked through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>, the rules relating to the declaration of member's interests, the situation of lobbyists, the handbook of the Department of Administrative Services, the rules relating to gifts and things of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members and senators had an opportunity to contribute suggestions to the committee. Senator Kernot certainly did that in a letter she wrote to the Speaker on 24 November 1994. She said she was writing to him in response to the group's invitation for comment on the proposed draft code. She expressed the view that `while covering some important subject matter, it needs to be strengthened and expanded'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She raised particular concerns such as the need for the issue of personal references from ministers to be addressed, a factor in the resignation of Senator Richardson in 1992. Overall, we decided that it should not be a document that tried to spell out every aspect of human behaviour that may arise such as if thou art a minister, thou shalt not write a personal reference, et cetera, or if thou owns a sandwich bar, thou shalt not, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came to the view that you could not have a code of conduct that attempted codification in that fashion and that it needed to deal with the type of behaviour that we were referring to. In her letter, Senator Kernot referred to the need for a clearer delineation between the roles of departmental staff and ministerial-political advisers. She raised issues about ministerial grants and how they would be dealt with and other matters. We considered those things and felt that, in principle, they were dealt with by the code in more general terms that we presented to the parliament. She again put another submission to us later but there really is not time to deal in detail with all of these things this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to come to the two documents in question. I share the view that it is regrettable that only one of the documents is before us. One is entitled, `A framework of ethical principles for senators and members', the other, `A framework of ethical principles for ministers and presiding officers'. For some reason it is only, `A framework of ethical principles for senators and members' which Senator Kernot is dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the amendment which Senator Kernot has brought to the Senate, I wish to refer specifically to paragraph 3 of the document, `Respect for the dignity and privacy of others'. Senator Kernot states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members and Senators shall treat other Members and Senators, members of the public and officials honestly and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA>In principle, one of course would not disagree with that, but if you are actually going to put it in print, it is an extremely difficult thing to adjudicate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She said today that she would set up a committee with some members of the public on it to be the adjudicators or the enforcers of this code of conduct. But it is such a subjective test that members and senators shall deal honestly and fairly. I would think all of us do that. I would not doubt that my colleagues in this chamber deal honestly and fairly with members of the public, their own colleagues and officials. But I can imagine the sorts of situations where somebody may disagree with what a member or senator wants to do, suggests or proposes, and then claim that the issue has not been dealt with honestly and fairly. Who is going to judge? There is another part in the same paragraph of Senator Kernot's amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . shall at all times, as far as they are able to, provide responsive, effective and courteous service to all those with whom they have official dealings.</PARA>
<PARA>What does `responsive' mean? Does it mean, `If you, Senator, do what I ask you to do, you are being responsive'? If you say, `No, I cannot write to the Minister for Immigration and suggest that this should happen, I'm sorry', will you then be challenged, taken to court, taken to this committee, for having been unresponsive? Surely a member or senator has to make a judgment about such a thing. I have said to constituents, `I really do not agree with that. I cannot espouse your cause.' Will I then be challenged for being unresponsive as a member?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective? I write to the minister, I plead with him, leave a few tears on the letter, ring him up, go and see him, waylay him in the corridor and he still says, `No, I will not do what you are asking me to do for your constituent.' So I have not been effective. Who will judge whether I tried hard enough, or whether I should have done something else? I would say that I do everything I can to be effective for my constituents with the things that I believe should be pursued. Who is going to judge? And `courteous service'? Again, it is extremely subjective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes up again under paragraph (f) principle 5, to act solely in the terms of the public interest. My goodness! Look at the law books. How do you determine the public interest? And `make objective choices on merit in awarding contracts'. There are other things that need to be taken into account. I cannot accept Senator Kernot's amendments, but I do suggest the Senate adopts the code. </PARA>

One thing we ought to realise is that parliament is perhaps the most important institution in our democratic system. We can sometimes not understand that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at ways to improve parliament, we have to look at the realities upon which it operates. If we try to invent a system different from the one that operates and which has operated very well, we will be getting ourselves into trouble. We have to remember that the parliamentary system under which we operate has delivered us perhaps the best country in the world. Again and again, people get up in this chamber and outside it and parliament and say that Australia is a country that has a lot going for it and that it is particularly fortunate when compared with other countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you look around the trouble spots of this world and see the conflict and oppression that emanates from all sorts of places around the globe, you have to concede that the system under which we live here is a fine one and that the parliament has played a big part in it. So have others, such as the courts. I commend for reading a speech given by the present Chief Justice of the High Court, the Hon. Chief Justice Gerard Brennan, which was the Blackburn lecture of 7 August 1990. He criticised parliament. He went on to say that it still serves a great purpose but that it should be supplemented by the courts. That is a matter for debate. He said that the system that we operate under needs improvement and that it does not need replacing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That theme was echoed by Sir Winston Churchill, who said that democracy is the worst form of government except for every other one that has been tried. That sums up our problem at the moment. Our problem is that somehow we have sold ourselves short. Somehow we as parliamentarians have accepted the trenchant criticism, a lot of which is justified and a lot of which is not, that puts us down and indicates to the world that somehow we are less than perfect. Of course we are less than perfect. But nobody in the world is perfect; everybody is in need of redemption. We need confidence when we go about our tasks in this place. Senator Reid is absolutely right when she says that people in this place try to go about their tasks as well as they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course they can be improved. Senator Kernot has introduced today and spoken eloquently to a topic that we should discuss not only today but again and again. A reading of the High Court says that there have always been members of parliament who have gone beyond the pale. Cases such as the King v Boston and Horne and another v Barber&mdash;there are others as you go through the High Court reports&mdash;show that there have always been people who have got out of line.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read the draft proposed by the working group I could not help but feel that the document, by and large, as best I can tell from quickly reading it, refers to and reflects upon the honesty and integrity of parliamentarians in respect of ensuring that they do not accrue benefits improperly in the discharge of their duties or as a result of having those positions and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend two moments reflecting and dwelling upon the ethics that, in some respects, in the chamber we should have respect for each other and for the proper functioning of the political system. Senator Cooney made the point that parliament should be the most important institution in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our quaint system of the amalgamation of the Westminster and American systems has left us, for the last few years at least, with one house of parliament which has a majority which is now accountable exclusively to the executive government. I do not make judgments as to who is better or who is worse. In many respects, the House of Representatives is simply a rubber stamp of cabinet. These days not even caucus or the coalition party room, depending on who is in government, has a say. Essentially it is cabinet. All cabinet has to do is make a decision, announce it and it is fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a moment to have a quick look at the document that Senator Cooney referred to. It says that 95 per cent agree that federal politicians should stop arguing with each other and concentrate more on running the country; 39 per cent agree that parliamentarians are looking after themselves. Interestingly enough, 40 per cent of those who believe in the good old free enterprise system are Liberals, and only 34 per cent are ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-two per cent of Liberals believe that most parliamentarians represent their party. For the ALP, ever faithful unto each other, it is 26 per cent. For the Liberal Party, it is 22 per cent. Loyalty does not seem to be quite as important. One of the qualities I have espoused about the Labor Party in the 25 years I have been involved in politics is that its members are loyal unto each other, even in the most adverse circumstances; for all the wrong reasons and with the wrong results. Unless I have missed something, one example is the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has stuck with Mrs Lawrence. You cannot help but admire them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thoroughly support a code of conduct. Perhaps it is the rigid bureaucratic system that we have in this country&mdash;I suspect it is&mdash;which means that there is very little unearthed corruption in the political system in this country. When we put members of parliament in goal for ticking up a shampoo or for a car trip down the road to see their daughter in boarding school, I do not think much gets through the net. Perhaps it is the bureaucratic system whereby ministers have to go through such a long process before a decision is made in the interests of the country, never mind themselves. Perhaps we have institutionalised, by some accident, some protection against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is true of our system&mdash;and many members of other parliaments make this observation when they come here and see us at question time&mdash;is the robust nature of our treatment of each other and the institution. There is nothing wrong with good, healthy, robust debate in respect of each other, but it is quite a different matter to have the capacity and the facility to damage people who cannot represent themselves, without a care or without responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of those people who made representations prior to what is now the 1987 Parliamentary Privileges Act.

But it is of no great reward if the damage is on the front page of a newspaper. With due respect, there is not much censure of members and senators who get up and defame people&mdash;which they are entitled to do; the very purpose of privilege is freedom of thought and freedom of expression without fear or favour&mdash;in an irresponsible, improper, unfair and morally corrupted way; nor is there much of a filter system to ensure that they don't do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I am sensitive to it, and that is why I have been such a caring, sensitive and warm person in the 15 years I have been here. Before I got here I used to read about myself in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, invariably on the front page, as a result of the then Senator Peter Walsh having mixed up a pot of lies, untruths, half-truths and utter fabrications and then dumped them in the Senate&mdash;much to the amusement, on occasions, of the then Senator Chaney. </PARA>

There is no proper process, there is no proper system, whereby we have checks and balances on members' and senators' conduct towards the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other risk we run with our system of parliament is that it is very easy to undercut and undermine the rights of individual members and senators, whether they be of a major political party, of a minor political party or an independent. If the Prime Minister wants to give the wink and the nod to the Speaker in the House of Representatives, who is there by his grace, you can be quite certain that anybody who belongs to the other major party which is in a minority can have all their rights undercut and destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing applies in this place. If the Deputy President or the President feels under some sort of threat from his or her party room in terms of future votes for future promotion or future votes for continuation of the present position, it is terribly easy to corrupt the process, however subtle it might be. That was one of the things that always weighed very heavily on my mind when I was in the chair. I was always determined to ensure that the Senate did not end up like the House of Representatives in terms of the role and function of the Speaker.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess it makes me wonder sometimes when people look at codes of conduct. I thought we generally accepted that there was a code of conduct. I thought that most people, if not all of us in a place like this&mdash;and in the general community&mdash;believe that you exercise your conduct in the best way you possibly can. I do not necessarily agree that you should have to have some written form of words that is almost impossible to implement. If you look at codes of conduct that relate to other areas such as doctors, solicitors, people of the cloth and journalists, it is clearly evident that codes of conduct do not necessarily stop people from being unethical&mdash;it happens on many occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would have thought that, if this was such an important issue, it would have been debated shortly thereafter. If we were so serious about having a code of conduct&mdash;and in all the contributions I have heard today everybody has been saying how important it is that we demonstrate to the public that we are worthy of their support and that we can conduct ourselves in a proper way&mdash;if that was so important, why didn't we deal with it some time ago?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You may say it was your first chance; I do not know that I would agree with that. Where codes of conduct do apply, they do not stop people from being unethical. Those people will continue to be so. It is very unfortunate that the public's general view of politicians and the political system is very low. This is probably caused by some people who have been unethical in politics. But having another set of words is not necessarily going to solve that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was just reading through the draft set of words and came to No. 3 `Respect for the Dignity and Privacy of Others'. It says that members and senators must have due regard for the rights and obligations of all Australians. I would have thought that that was without question. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They must respect the privacy of others and avoid unjustifiable or illegal discrimination. They must safeguard information obtained in confidence in the course of their duties and exercise responsibly their rights and privileges as Members and Senators.</PARA>
<PARA>It was not that long ago, as I remember, that we had a Senate select committee inquiring into the Fairfax sale. It was the view of some in the opposition, joined by the Australian Democrats, that information that was obtained in confidence ought not have remained in confidence. That again highlights the problem with the implementation of any code of conduct. Who sits in judgment on all these things? Who enforces them and what are the penalties? If we go further into Senator Kernot's motion, we see what she is proposing in 7A `Accountability and Openness'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members and Senators are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public, must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.</PARA>
<PARA>What is appropriate scrutiny? It is a bit like asking how long is a piece of string. It continues `and should be as open as possible'. What does that mean about the decisions and actions that they take? It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They should give reasons for the decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands it.</PARA>
<PARA>Who determines that? I heard Senator Kernot say that it really comes down to party lines. That is exactly what we will have. We will have a system where people will line up and the numbers will be played out, depending on the circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a couple of points in the three minutes I have to participate in this debate. One of them is that the greatest threat, the greatest danger, to the institution of parliament is the deliberate duplicity of some of the people who grace the halls of this parliament. Nothing could bring the parliament into more disrepute than a Prime Minister who promises one thing before an election and immediately following the election breaks that promise. Nothing could bring the parliament into greater disrepute than a minister who has been proved in a royal commission to be a liar, who refuses to take the honourable course and who is supported by so-called ministers of the Crown. That is the sort of duplicity that brings this parliament into disrepute.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are supposedly in here to keep this lot on the other side and, I suppose, us, honest.

This party, which supposedly was there to be an independent force and to keep the institution honest, supports the Labor Party in most important issues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unresolved whistleblowers committee arose out of concerns, especially in the state of Queensland. Whilst we went through the hearings and discussed matters of quite some moment, emotions did run high from time to time and there were concerns within the committee as to its direction. But I am very pleased to say that at the end of the day we did come down with a unanimous report. I think it once again indicates the very real benefit of the Senate committees that are able to do very good work for the benefit of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am talking about the work of the committee, it would only be appropriate also to thank the staff of the committee and those who spent many hours travelling around the country with us and preparing the draft reports, which Senator Woodley and I went through in great detail, checking words and commas. It was a credit to the committee as a whole that we were able to come down with a unanimous report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of elements that I would like to address in this report. It is noteworthy that we as a committee were somewhat concerned as to the way the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland conducted itself. I note that we as a committee also made mention of a particular officer of the Criminal Justice Commission and his behaviour. In particular, I refer to paragraph 4.47 of our report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the Committee notes the response by Mr Barnes to questions about political affiliations which, while being accurate, was less than helpful for the Committee's understanding of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice Senator Murphy smiling; in my usual style of cooperation, I agreed that such a mellow comment be allowed to go in the report and agreed that I might make some other points whilst addressing the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation was that, within the Criminal Justice Commission&mdash;an organisation which is required to investigate and deal with matters of inappropriate behaviour in public offices&mdash;it is important that justice be done and also be seen to be done. Some of these inquiries were of a potentially politically embarrassing nature to the Labor government in Queensland. As a result, it was drawn to our committee's attention that certain people appointed to investigate matters were alleged to have party political affiliations. Mr Barnes was one of these people and, whilst I do not want to canvass what happened within the committee as I was trying to get responses to this allegation, Mr Barnes basically said, `Look, I'm not a member of Labor Lawyers and I have never been a member of the Australian Labor Party.' That was a completely truthful statement but, I add, a wholly misleading statement, because Mr Barnes had in fact been a member of the Association of Labor Lawyers&mdash;and to be a member of Labor Lawyers you do not have to be a member of the Australian Labor Party. But the objective of Labor Lawyers is to help implement the platform and policies of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a committee found that his response was less than helpful. I would put it a bit stronger than that because somebody who is required to make judgments and determine and investigate matters of whistleblowing ought to be beyond reproach and his words should be able to be taken at face value without the need to try to sift through them to see if there is a little hole in them or whether he has been too smart. Unfortunately from the committee's point of view, on this occasion he was less than helpful. It did no credit to the Criminal Justice Commission to have an officer at the table giving that sort of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other matters concerned me greatly in this inquiry and a lot of those matters are mentioned in the report. But the shredding of the Heiner documents and the treatment of a Mr Kevin Lindeberg were matters of great concern to me and the committee. Those documents should never have been shredded and it really was a travesty of justice. I took great heart from the comments made by Mr Ian Callinan QC who, when he appeared before the committee, indicated that he thought there was the potential that that course of action could deny justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just indicate very briefly that the documents that were destroyed were the basis for a potential defamation action, and the Queensland cabinet took it upon itself to destroy those documents so that the basis for a defamation proceeding would be denied to a Mr Peter Coyne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a police officer were to deliberately destroy information or evidence in a potential court case, that police officer would face official misconduct charges. Indeed, if I deliberately destroyed information on the basis that I thought I might need it in a Supreme Court proceeding or something of that nature, and court proceedings were actually under way, that also would be an offence. But on this occasion the Queensland government said that legal proceedings had not been instituted, and the reason and rationale for their saying that legal proceedings had not been instituted was that there was no Supreme Court action on foot; letters passed from lawyers to the department asking them for the documents were not deemed to be sufficient to indicate that legal proceedings were under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that, if the rule of law in this country is to be upheld, is to be viewed in the light that it ought be, then the Crown has a duty to be a model litigant and to always act in a most appropriate manner and not in an inappropriate manner. The destruction of evidence to avoid the government from becoming involved in a potential defamation case was below the standard of conduct that one would expect of the Crown which has a duty to be a model litigant. I believe that that reflects very poorly on the Queensland cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only a few minutes left, so I will briefly turn to Messrs Harris and Reynolds who were two Queensland police officers. I note that one rejoices in a surname similar to yours, Madam Acting Deputy President, but undoubtedly he is unrelated. Even if you were related, Madam Acting Deputy President, I believe you could hold your head up high because I believe police officer Reynolds acted with great propriety and was unfortunately vilified by the police department and then Inspector Huey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few seconds remaining I want to comment on the fact that the Queensland government agreed to release a certain document to us to read in private, which we did, but on the basis that we did not divulge the totality of the document. Aspects of the document had already been released by prosecutions and court cases involving these officers. To only release part of the document and then claim legal privilege and confidentiality on the rest of it was in the view of the committee inappropriate and I want to associate myself with that finding of the committee. Once again the Crown has not acted in an appropriate way in Queensland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to comment on the issue involving Mr Michael Barnes and his political affiliations. The report indicates that his answer to Senator Abetz's question was less than helpful. I do not disagree with that, but the fact of the matter is that I do not think we ought to pass judgment or carry out guilt by association. I think that at the time Mr Barnes was investigating the particular case he was not a member of the Association of Labor Lawyers. I find most of the members I know to be most unhelpful and they do not necessarily do the Labor Party a great deal of good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to quickly touch on the shredding of the Heiner documents. It really must be put into context. There was a change of government and this inquiry was established under the previous government. As best we could ascertain, the inquirer thought his inquiry was set up under a particular act. If that had been the case, it would have meant that those people giving evidence to the inquiry would have had the right of privilege and protection. That evidence and the documents associated with it would not have been available for defamation proceedings because they would have been protected by privilege. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The new government then came in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the committee could see&mdash;and I say this with all honesty and it is certainly my view&mdash;any rhyme or reason for the new Queensland government acting in a particular way to protect itself or somebody else. I think it acted in good faith. As it says in the report, it sought all of the information and acted in accordance with the information that it received. The report does say that it may have been more helpful to have ultimately maintained those documents. Nevertheless, I think it should not be inferred that the government acted improperly to protect a vested interest, because that clearly was not the case. That is all I would like to say about the matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coolibah tree in Station Creek in Hughenden still stands, and with a little bit of help from some tree doctors and others is now looking very fine. Without demeaning the process of historical recognition in western Queensland, I must say that it is nice to have another tree in western Queensland apart from the one at Barcaldine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will, I might say, complement the tree of knowledge in Barcaldine and the other tourist facilities there such as the Stockman's Hall of Fame, the museum to the prehistoric remains in the Winton area and also the proposals by the Winton Shire Council and others to establish a Waltzing Matilda interpretive centre and museum in Winton. I was pleased to be able to talk to people from the Winton shire during this week about that particular proposal. All those things are attracting much needed dollars to the north-west of Queensland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday I unveiled two plaques commemorating the passage through the Flinders shire of the Burke and Wills relief expedition of Frederick Walker in 1861.

I think they were the first Europeans to pass through that area of North Queensland. In the following year, William Landsborough led an expedition also searching for the Burke and Wills party. He started in the gulf, as I understand it, and moved south but also passed through this area of what is now the Flinders shire. Quite coincidently&mdash;perhaps it was not coincidence&mdash;one way or another they both blazed the same coolibah tree in Station Creek in Hughenden.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an unusual but very important task which I think is best undertaken in the adjournment debate. I have been given a document by a constituent. This document is to contribute to the longstanding community debate about the Orr case, a contentious component of Tasmania's social and legal history. The document is not shy, it is bold, it is brave and I will quote from it directly in order not to detract from the serious commitment with which its author, Mr Paul Berry, has presented it to me. Mr Berry writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In connection with the case of Sydney Sparkes Orr v. The University of Tasmania, No. 278 of 1956, I, Christopher Paul Berry, known as Paul Berry, of 45 Sixth Ave., West Moonah in Tasmania, make the following Accusation; viz., of the employment of crime in the course of the dismissal of, and in defence of the dismissal of Professor Sydney Sparkes Orr in March of 1956: also allegations regarding judicial conduct in the hearing of No. 278 of 1956, and on its further hearing on Appeal to the High Court of Australia in May of 1957.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that I echo a disquiet which has never vanished: which has not been satisfactorily allayed despite the recourse by Professor Orr to the highest tribunal to which access could be had, within the Australian justice structure. I suggest further, that concern about this case and its implications about judicial probity has not been limited to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acknowledged tendency inherent in power, to corrupt not only those who hold it but also those who lack, is proverbial. The Orr case, I say, shows this tendency as more than proverb. The Orr case shows, I say, that within Australia justice is, or at least then was vulnerable; that justice itself is in peril from those who operate within the system. The Orr case showed that the worst can happen: the Courts of our land can be manipulated as a vehicle, not of justice, but of oppression. In the Orr case, certain judges can be seen to have acted as if they were no better than mafiosi, godfathers protecting their own. In the ultimate, I say, their priority must be taken to have been that the system and certain individuals within it should survive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Edmund Burke I believe it was, who made the observation that all that is required for evil to succeed is that good men and women shall do nothing. It becomes accepted as axiomatic that when the courts have spoken, good men and women can do nothing. With this I would not agree. I recall recent words, if I remember aright, of Sir William Deane of the High Court of Australia, who said inter alia that the right of free speech and therefore of criticism, is implicit in the Australian Constitution. It has also been said, either by the same Judge or by another of similar standing, that in the ultimate, power resides with the people. I recognise the sanctity and authority of such sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we, the Australian people, contemplate moving from parliamentary democracy under monarchy to a republican system, I feel it to be not only appropriate but vital, that my allegations be explored. Because I still have faith in `responsible government' which, of course, ought to mean `responsive government' I direct this statement and appended Affidavit to all Federal Parliamentary members of both Houses; of all parties and of none. The response to this will surely indicate whether we as a nation have yet developed sufficient maturity to examine ourselves and our institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The materials upon which I rely in making the within allegations are all extant. Properly examined, I claim they amount to clear evidence compelling belief as to the employment of crime by some within the profession of Law; crime committed for the express purpose of subverting justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allegations which I make, I make upon oath. They are, of course, framed merely in the language of an ordinary layman. If this be a barrier to their adequate understanding, I am willing to reaffirm them should it, for the purpose of their investigation, be necessary to recast the form of their wording.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of what many, including our Prime Minister and others in government have maintained to be mere political ploy, in the institution of a Royal Commission into the Carmen Lawrence matter, I dare to suggest that the statement which I make cannot but be seen as warranting investigation at a similar level. Such a Commission should be set up with terms of reference sufficiently wide as to permit input from other citizens who, from their own knowledge or experience, may have similar disquiet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As evidence of my good faith as well as by way of introducing other probative material, I include also allegations which surely ought to be regarded as of a defamatory nature, concerning two persons alive to this day. Thus it may be seen that I am not taking refuge in the relatively secure pastime of vilifying the dead or the powerless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I state that I have already published in a manner such as to satisfy the terms of section 200 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code Act 1924, the allegations appended. Thus it will be seen that I am offering myself for criminal prosecution as well as for civil suit. My purpose in making these allegations upon oath is that I might leave myself no room for retreat from them, without their testing and their sufficient vindication. Indeed, I challenge both these persons to sue me or to prosecute me. I emphasise, however, that I hold no ill will towards either of them. I am actuated neither by malice nor by hope of gain. Indeed, I consider that my life, my liberty and my property may all hereby be placed at risk.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Berry continues with an accusation which I will not read or table or attempt to incorporate into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tonight but which I will bring to the Senate at a later time. He stands by this accusation. I emphasise again that he makes this document available to me and, therefore, to the Senate eventually and to the whole of Australia, in a mood of gravity and seriousness which I hope has been evidenced by the way I have read the document. I will continue this in another adjournment debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak further tonight on the unanimous report of the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases, which was tabled in the Senate on 26 October 1999, and which has been referred to again tonight. The committee had strict terms of reference. There was always a will amongst the committee members that we reach a unanimous report to indicate to the community at large the Senate's desire to have whistleblower legislation that really affords whistleblowers protection, and, difficult though it may be, encourages honest people to stand up to corruption where and when it is discovered, otherwise we diminish ourselves as individuals and as a nation which purports to believe in accountability. If we cannot frame legislation to protect honest citizens alerting proper authorities to corruption, particularly in the public sector, then as legislators, I believe, we would have failed in our duty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I touched upon the shredding of the Heiner inquiry documents in my first speech. I wish to return to it in order that the Senate understands my feelings on the matter. Some time ago I told the house that the matter remains unresolved. Indeed, it remains to be addressed by a proper authority. I pointed towards a significant submission presented to the committee from Ian Callinan QC and his junior counsel, Roland Peterson, which addressed the admissions of fact and argued that sections 129 and 132 of the criminal code of Queensland applied in this instance. They did not indicate the guilt or otherwise of the people involved in the shredding. I concurred with their arguments, but it is really a matter for the police and the courts after all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A submission from a man of the eminence of Mr Callinan QC cannot be lightly put aside. It raised very serious and unique questions which our committee did not finally address. That has been personally distressing to me. I believe that an unacceptable precedent has been created in my state of Queensland because the Queensland crown solicitor and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission have asserted that the shredding, although against certain uncontested facts, was and is legal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reaching a unanimous position within the constraints imposed on us by the terms of reference, we chose to describe the shredding as an exercise in poor judgment. The Queensland government should have heeded more the notion of the crown as a model litigant. We concluded that the documents should have been retained for the purposes of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we are faced with the fact that the executive of the Queensland government, with the knowledge that the Heiner inquiry documents were required for foreshadowed litigation, secretly destroyed them in order to stop or frustrate a Queensland citizen litigating against the crown and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that it was a new and inexperienced government trying to do its best to deal with a problem created by the former National Party government. I have a problem with this argument, despite Senator Murphy quite rightly pointing out that we had difficulty finding a motive for the government's action. However, if that view were to gain currency concerning litigation involving the crown, it could reduce our legal system to chaos. The crown is in perpetuity and learning curves have no standing in law, especially for the crown. No matter how new a government may be, it still has continuous access to crown law advice from day one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings into play the curious role of the crown solicitor in this affair, which opens up even more serious questions concerning the rights of citizens in Queensland to litigate against the crown. Before any sort of negotiation involving access to public records which may lead to court proceedings can begin, it seems that a Queensland citizen must now serve a writ on the government to ensure the security of those records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is absolutely clear from the evidence is that, while the crown solicitor was considering Mr Coyne's solicitor's letters, one of which officially put the crown on notice, the cabinet decided within days to destroy the evidence to stop or frustrate Mr Coyne litigating. The question that then arises is whether this new government was acting fairly and openly. The evidence is that it was not. This is one of the fundamental reasons why the two victims, Mr Kevin Lindeberg and Mr Peter Coyne, have pursued justice for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the government inform Mr Coyne and his solicitor that it had decided to shred the evidence to stop him litigating it, albeit to protect other people from defamation proceedings? It did not. Instead, it told him, weeks after the shredding had been ordered, that the crown solicitor was still considering their legal demands. That deception forestalled the issuance of a writ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the government tell the State Archivist that it wanted the documents destroyed in order to stop them being used in evidence in known, impending litigation? It did not. It withheld crucial evidence from her. In fact, I would say it deceived her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the government tell Mr Lindeberg that the government intended to shred the evidence? At one meeting on the day the documents were being examined for destruction, he was told by the government that they were safe. Several days later, when he inadvertently learnt of the plans to shred, he was immediately removed from the case, upon the insistence of a minister, and later sacked by his union over his handling of the case. From that moment it deceived him and then took his head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the government allow public servants like the State Archivist and departmental advisers to attend our committee hearings to tell their story? It did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the actions of the Director-General, which our committee described as `bureaucratic ineptitude at best or deliberate deceit at worst', could not have been hers alone. She had a direct line to the cabinet. We are left with one unavoidable conclusion in this case, that she acted in the knowledge that the cabinet was behind her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about one of the most fundamental rights cherished in our nation&mdash;the right to seek redress in the court and for the crown to be the fountain of justice, not injustice, and to act with probity and fairly;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, to be, as Mr Callinan says, a model litigant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, according to the current evidence, that cabinet ordered the destruction of known, foreseeable evidence while the crown solicitor was still considering other legal demands on the material. On the face of it, the crown solicitor inexplicably held his silence and did nothing to protect the evidence, as was his duty. Instead, he, like other public officials and members of cabinet, stood back and allowed the evidence to be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another scenario which has yet to be fully exhausted. Did the crown solicitor attempt to intervene, in accordance with his duty, to protect the evidence after he learnt his client had decided to destroy the evidence? Was his final advice specifically rejected because the government was marching to a different drum?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues surrounding the shredding are alive and important. They are to do with justice, fair dealing and due process. It is my understanding that Mr Lindeberg, the man who brought this affair to the attention of this house, is currently considering further options with his counsel, Mr Callinan QC, and Mr Peterson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it may be argued that this is very much a state issue, I suggest that the Senate should not turn its back on this long running affair because it cuts to the very core of integrity in government and the rule of law, which should concern us all, whether we come from Western Australia, the back of Bourke or Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a)(i)-(iii) &amp; (b) The Department has an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program, which has been revised for 1995-1998. The Program establishes benchmark standards against which the progress of the EEO Program can be assessed. The benchmark standards aim for a general increase in the number of employees who are from a non-English speaking background to 12% for the Canberra-based Divisions, and maintenance of the number of employees who are from a non-English speaking background for the Antarctic Division at 4.1%. The Bureau of Meteorology, which is part of the Department, and which has a separate EEO Program has not set any targets for the number of employees who are from a non-English speaking background.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(i)-(iii) The Department does not keep records in the form requested. However the Government's APPOINT system contains details of positions filled and appointments made to statutory and non-statutory bodies within the Portfolio. EEO target groups are identified to the extent that individuals have provided these details on appointment. In the 1994-95 financial year the total number of positions filled by people of non-English speaking background was 34 (8.4%). Details for the 1993-94 financial year are not available.</PARA>
