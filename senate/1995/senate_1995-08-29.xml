<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is directed to Senator Cook representing the Treasurer. I remind the minister that today's balance of payments is the 11th consecutive monthly deficit over $2 billion. There was a 12th just under $2 billion. What is the effect of these horrendous figures on inflation, interest rates and living standards and, after nearly 13 years of Labor, are the Australian people not entitled to something better?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="525" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the opposition, which does not have an economic policy, once again tries to talk some doom and gloom into the economy because they see political advantage in talking the economy down, making Australians feel worse off. They believe they will vote for a bedraggled coalition with no policies, if that were the general view. It is surprising to me that the question should be cast in the way it has been by Senator Hill because tomorrow the national accounts come out which will show the 16th consecutive quarter of economic growth in Australia&mdash;one of the longest running periods of economic growth we have ever had, and certainly the longest running period of growth since we have returned to statistics in this form. So that is the key statistic that this country should direct its attention to, that we have an economy in growth. We have come off the back of 16 consecutive quarters. We have in view several more years of continuing growth, falling unemployment, rising employment opportunities, rising household disposable income, higher profit margins for companies and growing exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's current account figures that have come out are, of course, the monthly figures for the month of July. The Statistician cautions people approaching these figures to see them for what they are&mdash;monthly figures that are subject to revision and which are volatile. Notwithstanding that, Mr President, the figures are welcomed because they show a 17 per cent reduction in the current account deficit, and they are well below what the market expectations were. The market forecast a figure in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion; they came in at $2.1 billion&mdash;a level below what the market forecast. This month is the first decrease in the monthly trend estimates since December 1993, the first decrease in a period of 18 months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a point of order, Mr President, as to relevance, the minister might have in fact said that the trend figures are $2 1/2 billion and only down one per cent. Apart from that, the question was: what is the effect of 11 consecutive deficits of over $2 billion on inflation, interest rates and living standards?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no point of order. Senator Hill knows there is no point of order. I am explaining the current account in order to make remarks on your question relevant because, Senator Hill, might I say, you have a penchant for in fact misleading the Australian public about the strength of Australia's economic position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was making the point that this month is the first decrease in the monthly trend estimate since December 1993. It is in line with our expectations&mdash;expectations that we have forecast&mdash;that the current account will trend down over the course of the current year. We do not necessarily expect that it will trend down in dollar terms but we do expect, as we have forecast, that it will trend down in percentage terms. I say that because the economy is growing&mdash;and growing quite strongly and sustainably. Nonetheless, at the end of this budgetary year we expect the current account to have fallen from its level of six per cent of GDP to 5 1/2 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has policy settings in place to ensure that the current account deficit falls further. They are to bring this current budget into surplus, which we will do this year. We will have a surplus without asset sales in the following economic year. We will ensure that we have a program for national savings brought about by our commitment&mdash;and this government's commitment alone&mdash;to national superannuation by generating a pool of national savings for investment in our economy and by lifting overall the level of national savings in this country. Of course, the government is pursuing ongoing micro-economic reform, the latest instalment of that being the introduction of competition policy, which we piloted past the states in the most recent quarter. We have also been able to implement effective labour market reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Minister, I understand that next week you will be attending the first ever joint meeting of trade ministers from ASEAN&mdash;the Association of South East Asian Nations&mdash;and CER, closer economic relations, trade ministers. In view of the unquestionable importance of trade and investment with ASEAN to Australia's economic future, could you advise of Australia's plans for this meeting and the possible outcomes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="526" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important new stage in the ongoing process of positioning Australia in the centre of the economic growth that is going on in our region here in East Asia. It is part of the process of winning a future for Australia, economically and otherwise. The important thing to recognise about this meeting&mdash;important as it is&mdash;is that Australia did not have to beg for a place in this or barge in or push our way in. We were invited by ASEAN to participate in this; it was their initiative. As a result of the ongoing and concerted strategy of this government over the last several years, we have earnt our place at this table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that economic groupings like CER Australia-New Zealand, and AFTA in ASEAN start this level of dialogue because it is what is happening globally. Within the Americas, within Europe, and between Europe and the Americas, you find this growing dialogue as trade spills over not only national borders but also the borders of free trade areas. Trade will not be contained within artificial boundaries that we write, so we need to participate in this global operation. Therefore AFTA CER is a very important linkage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot, of course, pre-empt the meeting or prejudge its outcomes, but what we are looking for and what I am hopeful of is that the meeting will take AFTA CER cooperation forward in two ways. Firstly, we want to establish a close and strong pattern of dialogue with ASEAN on multilateral and regional issues where in future we might be able to develop a platform for greater cooperation which will make us much more effective within the WTO and other discussions&mdash;for example, on the relationship between the Americas and Europe and their respective free trade areas. Secondly, we are looking for a very concrete program of activities, very practical activities to expand opportunities for Australian exporters and workers by removing impediments to business, barriers in the way of Australians doing successful trade into ASEAN, and by providing tangible benefits to traders and workers in both AFTA and CER.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great complementarities that are being recognised more and more between our economies. I will be visiting a number of ASEAN countries before the Brunei meeting, and it is my intention to discuss these issues further. I should point out that one of the countries I will be visiting is Vietnam. Unlike the opposition, we do want to have dialogue with this very important trading partner for Australia. We will not refuse to talk to them. We will not boycott this growing market, where thousands of Australians are getting jobs in supplying goods into Vietnam. It is a very important market for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian private sector wants us to be involved. They are&mdash;and would necessarily be&mdash;concerned about the prospect of a government that refuses to talk to its trading partner and then gives differing explanations about why it refuses to talk. Perhaps to question the recollections of those opposite is a bit unfair; perhaps their recollections are confused. Perhaps we should have a royal commission into why they do not have accurate recollections of why they did not meet Mr Do Muoi a few weeks ago.</PARA>

We would get everybody else to give evidence first and then we would not let him arrive. Perhaps that is what we should do&mdash;his recollection seems to be a little confused. This is an important meeting. Whatever you think about the state of affairs in Australia&mdash;whether you support some aspects of what we are doing or not&mdash;this sort of economic engagement that AFTA CER captures is essential to any view of Australia's economic future and any economic plan which can credibly ensure Australia's future prosperity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. After ducking and weaving, Mr Keating has now conceded that it is not proper to lie to the parliament and the Australian people through parliament. Last week you chose to avoid the issue, claiming you had been asked a hypothetical question. Will you now take this further opportunity to resurrect your government's appalling level of parliamentary standards by agreeing that a minister should resign or be sacked if found guilty of misleading parliament?

Mr President, you could be forgiven for not knowing that the federal coalition had a drought policy, which is extraordinary when you consider the claims they make to be the advocates for rural Australia and, indeed, the National Party constantly says that. And, of course, we have a bench full of farmers and the shadow minister, John Anderson, is himself a farmer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought policy of the coalition will have been released, as Senator West has correctly said, a year ago tomorrow. A news release issued by Mr Anderson had the policy attached to it. As I said at the time, it is the only detailed policy that I have seen the opposition announce since the last federal election. He described it as `a blueprint the government must adopt'. That 10-point policy called for, among other things&mdash;these were its principal calls&mdash;the immediate introduction of a fodder subsidy scheme, the return of severe drought back to natural disaster relief arrangements and, importantly, that drought exceptional circumstances assistance be provided to farmers who had experienced drought in two of the past three years. That policy was condemned outright on the same day that it was released by national peak farming organisations across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The return of severe drought to natural disaster relief arrangements is completely at odds with the national drought policy, which was again only recently re-endorsed by all ministers of whatever political persuasion&mdash;state and federal&mdash;in Perth only a week ago. The coalition's exceptionable circumstances eligibility criteria would see fewer farming families receiving assistance from this government than those that are receiving it now.

Five years ago, the Martin inquiry into banking recommended the introduction of a basic banking product, and the banks did nothing then. Two months ago, the Prices Surveillance Authority asked banks to revisit the issue under the big threat of close monitoring if they did not. Now, after six years, the Treasurer has given the banks until 15 September to deliver something on the development of new products.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us see first whether they do it. We will then deal with failure if they do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me get this question in context. First of all, this government has introduced far more competition in the banking system of Australia. If any customer of a particular bank is dissatisfied with the services they get from that bank, the strong advice of this government is to shop around and find another bank that will deliver the services they want. I can illustrate the high degree of competitiveness by pointing to the field of home loans and household lending, where it is possible to get different products from different banks simply by shopping around intelligently between banks. It is a more competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the normal course the government would have left this situation to be dealt with by the market and by consumer sentiment moving away from a bank that is imposing higher charges than banks that impose lesser charges in order that they might attract more customers. We did commission a Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry into banking charges. We did that because we believed that we needed to survey this area. We believed that there was a need to improve the accountability of the banking system in imposing higher charges on their customers. That is why we commissioned the Prices Surveillance Authority's survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an outcome of that report, a number of recommendations which go to state regulation and other areas of banking have, I believe, been complied with. In the federal area the question of some of these charges formed part of the recommendations of the inquiry and, as you know, the Treasurer has contacted in this case the Commonwealth Bank, because in particular we believe that the accounting fee of $2 per month for accounts with less than $500 in them is positive discrimination against low income earners and those who have low deposits in accounts in banks&mdash;positive discrimination. We believe that the Commonwealth Bank should remove that charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has put those views quite strongly, has written to the banks, and we believe that the banks should remove that charge. At the present time their response is forthcoming. We will give them a reasonable margin of time before we decide what to do. But we have said this is not an empty request, that, if it is not complied with, the option for the government is to regulate and enforce compliance. As someone who is a self-confessed long-term depositor with the Commonwealth Bank when it was in public ownership, I am somewhat distressed to see that my bank is imposing these charges. If it continues to do so, I will shift my account to some other bank and I would urge every other consumer of that bank's services to do the same.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the minister to the recent launch by the tourism minister, Michael Lee, of a major campaign to promote tourism in Australia. Recent research shows that, within four or five years, tourism from Asian countries alone, excluding Japan, will bring more money into Australia than does farm produce. Given the increase in the importance of the tourism industry to our economy and the fact that we expect around 6.3 million tourists a year by the 2000 Olympics, what is the government doing to make visa issue as fast and uncomplicated as possible for international visitors?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="532" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jones for his continuing interest in this area. The industry he draws my attention to is one which is important for Australia. It is an industry which Michael Lee tells me generates export earnings of about $11 billion each year and employs some six per cent of the work force. It is also an industry which, as you rightly say, Senator Jones, is growing. In recent years we have seen growth in tourism, growth which is projected to grow even further and at a faster rate as we turn to the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such growth presents challenges for government and for my department and they are challenges that I think are being met extremely well. The starting point of the government is to achieve a system of hassle-free visa issue for tourists to Australia. To that extent we have issued a number of significant and imaginative initiatives to try to simplify and to speed up the process. An important one, which I think senators may remember, is one that was trialled just a little while ago in Japan but which has now been extended to other countries. That is the issue of visitor visas by reputable and well-established travel agents. Those arrangements which had been trialled some time ago have now been extended this year to travel agents or airlines in Singapore, the UK, Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong and Slovenia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Lee and I will be announcing today that the response in those countries to agency arrangements has been so encouraging that we will be expanding the system further still. By the end of this year we anticipate that we will have agency arrangements in at least 15 countries. Phase 2 begins in September and October when arrangements will be operating in Italy, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, North America, Indonesia and Tahiti. Further arrangements are also being put in the place. Later this year we anticipate that other centres in Europe, such as Greece, and South Africa will also have agency arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system we are talking about is straightforward. Visitors in these countries lodge their visa applications with a selected agent who electronically transmits the details to the local migration office for a decision. A decision is normally obtained within 24 hours. The decision is relayed to the sponsoring agent who is then authorised to issue a visa. In London, for instance, the system is working so well that agents effectively advise of visa decisions within about 30 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are checks on the system. If immigration officers need to check matters further they can go directly to the individual and therefore protect the individual's privacy. We also have checks in place and safeguards have been built into the new arrangements so that participating agencies do not have access to information held on our databases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as this particular initiative, we have also been working on other schemes such as the nominated visitor scheme which is for business visitors. This scheme allows their nominee in Australia to facilitate the processing. For instance, persons travelling will not have to visit migration offices themselves. We are also in the process of implementing an on-the-spot visa system which will soon be operating at trade shows and conferences in Europe. The first one will be taking off in Bonn in the not to distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are using new technology to ensure that when people arrive in Australia their processing time is cut. At the moment it takes on average only 55 seconds to process individual arrivals. We anticipate that, with the new technology coming on line later this year, we can effectively halve that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I say to Senator Jones that all this is happening at a time when we are having success with respect to overstayers in Australia and the protection of Australia's borders. All these systems that we have in place facilitating entry are not detracting from the fact that we have had a massive fall in the number of overstayers from some two per cent of those coming into Australia in 1989 to some 0.2 per cent now. That is an improvement of 90 per cent over the five-year period. That is the direction the government wants to take in this area in anticipation of growth in the system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conference is on at the moment. I attended the welcoming function on Sunday night for that conference and Mr Crean, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, officially opened the conference on Monday, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, DEET, is a major sponsor of that conference, so I think it is quite clear that we, as a government, have recognised the value of that conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to pay a tribute to the people who organised it, particularly from the northern suburbs of Adelaide, where there is a level of youth unemployment that is unacceptable, which the government has made clear. That is why we are sponsoring this conference, which has over 400 people attending&mdash;from not just around Australia, but from overseas&mdash;and giving papers. The emphasis is on attracting young people in their late teens and early-20s who are experiencing, obviously, unemployment and have had that experience to contribute their ideas. On Sunday night, Senator Harradine, I had a long conversation with several of those young people as they put their views about the social impact of long-term youth unemployment. They did it in a very articulate way, which I acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You implied in your remarks, quoting Professor Dwyer, which remarks I have not seen, that we are not interested in or we are not doing enough for youth unemployment. I want to draw your attention to the major commitment this government has made in the Working Nation statement of last year where, over a period of four years, we will be spending around $4 billion to $5 billion of funding on top of what we have already committed and particularly aiming it at getting long-term young unemployed people back into jobs through better training, through case management arrangements and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, in the last year, there has been over 200,000 new jobs created in Australia; there has been a substantial reduction in long-term unemployment; and there has been a reduction in youth unemployment. I believe that the support this government has given through Working Nation to tackle long-term unemployment, including youth unemployment, is an example that we can all be proud of. Certainly, this government is,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">but we are not going to rest on our laurels. We acknowledge that youth unemployment is a major issue. No government, including this one, will walk away from the fact that it is still unacceptably high. But we are dealing with it.

Senator Harradine may disagree with government policy in this area, but the whole thrust of our economic restructuring in Australia over the last decade is to make Australia an internationally competitive economy by creating good jobs, high value added jobs, particularly for our young people. I think there is more than enough evidence to show that we are having more than some success in that area. Not to say that we are satisfied with what we have achieved so far in that there is still a need for more jobs, particularly for young people.

When will the government admit that it has failed to properly invest in the education of Australians?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="538" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SMALL BUSINESS, CUSTOMS AND CONSTRUCTION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, first of all, I thank Senator Bell for giving us some indication that he wanted to raise this issue today in question time. As a result, I have been able to get some information. I make it very clear the government policy is and will remain that compulsory, up-front tuition fees are not to be charged to Australian students undertaking undergraduate programs at publicly-funded universities. The higher education contribution scheme is a mechanism by which these students contribute to the cost of their tuition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been no cuts to higher education, nor is there a widening gap in the funding of higher education between 1989 and 1996. Between 1989 and 1996 total Commonwealth funding for the sector has risen in constant prices from $3.8 billion in 1989 to $5.25 billion, and funded places have increased from 322,000 to 417,000. In 1996 the government will provide $12,575 for each full-time equivalent student place&mdash;almost seven per cent more than the equivalent rate in 1989. The government has given universities the flexibility to charge fees for postgraduate students, overseas students and students in non-award courses. They may also diversify their income sources by providing services to business, through research and consulting, joint commercial ventures and commercial arms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gilbert's argument that increased enrolments are threatening the quality of higher education misses the point. Over the last few years cut-off scores in some courses have gone down, reflecting changing patterns of demand for higher education. The Commonwealth's successful campaign to encourage year 12 students to consider TAFE and Australia's economic recovery have reduced the level of unmet demand for higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As measured by Professor Gilbert's own representative body, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, these movements in demand are reflected in university cut-off scores, a process which does not reflect the quality of higher education. The government has actively sought to bring students who would not otherwise have gone to university into the higher education system. Indeed, it would have been impossible and undesirable for cut-off scores to remain constant given the government's objectives of producing a larger and more diverse higher education system. Is Professor Gilbert advocating turning back the clock 30 or 40 years to a time when few Australians had the opportunity to go to higher education? In the late 1940s only two per cent of 17- to 22-year-olds went to university. The ratio is now more than 15 times that figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time the final years of primary schools catered for an elite. No-one would argue that the 100 per cent retention rate in primary schools has led to a decline in the quality of our school education system. Professor Gilbert himself advocated at the University of Tasmania an expansion of that university's undergraduate enrolments, presumably not to decrease the quality of its graduates. Professor Gilbert's point about the quality of graduates is an entirely different matter. The quality of graduates depends not only on the academic ability of students who enter higher education but also on the educational experiences that higher education institutions offer to their students. It is the education environment of Australia's universities which will determine whether they are attractive to international students.</PARA>

<PARA>There are a number of issues at stake in relation to this matter which need to be addressed and addressed most forcefully. Quite clearly the situation is that, when you have a royal commission, there is an inquiry into certain allegations and comments made. It is therefore highly appropriate that the person at the centre of those allegations and comments be called toward the very end so that person has the opportunity to address each and every allegation and comment made by all the various witnesses that have gone before. If Senator Evans really believes that Dr Lawrence should have been the first witness, she would have needed to come back each and every time to respond to each and every single witness that may have given evidence about some other matter which she did not address in her first appearance before the royal commission. As Senator Evans's comments clearly indicate, much as the Labor government would have liked to have moved Senator Evans out of the Senate, it could not afford to appoint him to the High Court because his understanding of these procedures is so abysmally poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The question of integrity was raised and whether or not Carmen Lawrence had an accurate recollection of what occurred. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> told us yesterday what the people in Victoria thought. Seeing that Dr Lawrence and the government are so anxious to quote polls about this situation, I point out that 90 per cent of the respondents did not believe Carmen Lawrence. In her own electorate, the vote is two to one against Carmen Lawrence on whether or not she is to be believed. There are some important things in life that absolutely stick in your mind. A great Australian, John McInnes, has a very good recollection of what happened on 15 July 1967. It was the day that he sacked Paul Keating. As he says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certain matters that people recall because of the import of the moment. It is quite clear to date, given the evidence that is before the commission&mdash;I only put it as strongly as that; the evidence that is currently before the commission&mdash;there is a shadow over the minister for health. She may well come back with her version of events which are quite proper and which may completely exonerate her. That may well be the case. But the situation is that as Senator Evans said when he made that very tacky attack on Senator Vanstone's sister-in-law: `You have to be beyond reproach.' It was absolutely pathetic and disgraceful and not at all becoming of somebody who likes to trot the world stage as a master diplomat and somebody who lusts after the position of Secretary-General to the United Nations. I would have thought he would have to clean up his act a bit before he could lay claim to such a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a shadow over the minister for health; clearly there is. As a result, it would be appropriate for her to stand aside during the inquiry and allow the inquiry to take its course. It really is amazing to see the government attack the way the commission is being run, saying that the person who is required to answer all these allegations ought to be the first witness. When would she then have the opportunity to respond to all the other ministers and all her staff members? It would be an absolute nonsense&mdash;a procedural nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans as a QC ought to know better. What he is trying to do is mislead the people of Australia by these comments, knowing full well that procedural fairness demands that every single witness who may say something adverse to Dr Lawrence says it before Dr Lawrence is required to give her version of events.

That is fair in the business of politics; but to go to the next step after the commission has been legitimately set up&mdash;the minister and his government are concerned about the potential of an adverse finding against Minister Lawrence&mdash;and attack the credibility of the royal commission and the counsel assisting the royal commission is, as I said, a new low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the attitude of this government to the royal commission. In an effort to protect Minister Lawrence, what did they first do? They sought to close down the commission. They used taxpayers' money in an attempt before the court to have the commission closed, in order that Minister Lawrence would never have to appear before the commission and in order that the truth would not be established. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the inconsistency. When that does not work, she then dictates&mdash;it had no relationship to her role as a federal minister, but that did not stop this government spending taxpayers' money on it; it was at taxpayers' expense&mdash;that she wants certain witnesses cross-examined before she gives evidence. At the same time, she comes out and condemns the commission for not allowing her to give evidence now. She wants it both ways. Minister Evans comes into the Senate and condemns counsel assisting the royal commission for not complying with that request, which it is impossible to comply with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this government seeking to do other than protect its minister and avoid the truth? We have heard a nonsense argument from Senator Evans day after day that because, he says, Minister Lawrence was the first to deny certain events, that should be believed over the evidence of a whole series of other witnesses. Has he considered the position that that denial placed her former colleagues in? Has he considered that it is very difficult for her former colleagues to come out subsequently and say something that contradicts her?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In fact, what has happened, in these circumstances of a royal commission when the public, through that process, is seeking the truth, is that these witnesses have come out and put the different position. But he says that their evidence should not be given the same credit as hers because she was the first to deny it. That, Minister, does not prove anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An enormous weight of evidence is building up&mdash;with not just a different recollection. This is not an issue of the recollection of events. Here we have her own deputy coming to her the day afterwards and saying that he is so upset about her conduct that he wished to resign. Senator Gareth Evans says, `We can quite understand why Minister Lawrence would forget that occurring.' What nonsense! How unreal! How can you realistically expect the Australian public to accept that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Minister Lawrence will now have her day before the commission. She will have her day to put her case, and the commissioner will have the responsibility of weighing the evidence that has been put before him by a whole range of witnesses and bringing down a finding of where he believes the truth lies. I suppose the only pleasing thing we finally got out of Senator Gareth Evans today was that if it is demonstrated that she lied the logical consequences must follow. That is very different from the attitude that this government has taken today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many different ways of running cases&mdash;civil and criminal litigation&mdash;for the defence and many different ways of running a royal commission. But it is unusual, it is very odd, to say the very least, when the royal commission is an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the lodging of a petition, not to seek very early on in the course of those proceedings evidence from the petitioner, Mr Halden. It is very odd not only not to seek evidence from the petitioner but also not to seek evidence from the person on whom the petitioner relied, Mr Easton, as to the substantive content of that petition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given, as everyone knows, that the primary target of the whole enterprise is Carmen Lawrence, the Premier of Western Australia at the time, and what she knew about the petition, whether she had advance knowledge of it and whether any of her conduct was improper&mdash;nobody denies that that is at the heart and soul of this whole enterprise&mdash;it is very odd, unusual, to say the least, not to be seeking evidence from her at a  very early stage of the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely nonsensical to say, as Senator Abetz did, that under those circumstances these witnesses would have to be called back after every other witness to give a response. They would certainly, no doubt, need to be called back, and would want to be called back, at the end of the proceedings, including, in particular, Dr Lawrence, but also the petitioners, Halden and the other guy. All three of them could reasonably have been expected to be called at the beginning of the process and, to the extent that other things were said during the proceedings in evidence which might have been contradictory, it would then be perfectly appropriate, at the end of the proceedings, to recall Dr Lawrence and the petitioners to give further evidence on the basis of those inconsistencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the way these things are done, and it raises questions as to why they were not done in this instance. Maybe there are good answers to those questions but we have not heard them. What we have now on the record, as of yesterday, which is the reason I raised this today&mdash;until then the situation was ambiguous&mdash;is a clear and explicit refusal from the commission to respond affirmatively to a clear and explicit formal request from Dr Lawrence to give evidence sooner rather than later, not to wait till the middle of September but to come on and give evidence now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows why she would want to give evidence at this point in time. It is perfectly appropriate that she should make that request. It needs to be answered why that request was refused. If you are going to run a royal commission like this, tacky as it is, and you want to pretend that everything is above board, that the whole proceedings are impartial from go to whoa, then those proceedings should not only be impartial but also be seen to be impartial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real question as to how impartial they could possibly be when someone who is not a bit player in the proceedings but absolutely central to the conduct of those proceedings, the counsel assisting the royal commission, is someone who is a close family relative of the shadow cabinet minister in the federal parliament who has an obvious axe to grind in this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, from start to finish, is a political ramp, it is a political royal commission and people who get caught up in it have to expect these sorts of questions to be asked and they should be prepared to answer these sorts of questions. They should be prepared to answer why we have a South Australian silk rather than a Western Australian silk appearing in this particular role. They have to expect to be asked what role they are playing in the conduct of the proceedings and what role they will play so far as the writing of the report is concerned. And they have to be expected to be asked, as I now ask Senator Vanstone to put on the public record and explain, whether there has been contact, discussion, dialogue, consultation between the two of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to minimise, if you want to change the appearances, if you want to minimise the risk to the appearance of impartiality, Senator Vanstone&mdash;who is not in the chamber at the moment&mdash;can go some distance to answering this by coming in here and giving an assurance in the Senate that she has not discussed the subject matter of this commission with the royal commission. If she wants to answer this concern that I have raised about the impartiality and the appearance of impartiality, she can help to respond to that, she can help to answer that by coming in here and giving such an assurance&mdash;and I invite her to do just that. And, until she does it, she has to expect these sorts of questions to continue to be asked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I absolutely stand by what I just said about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) dumping the opposition's detailed policy on drought assistance, which is a year old tomorrow. I am glad that Senator Crane has tabled the speech. Despite the fact that the architect of it was sitting in the audience listening, what Senator Crane said is correct. The Leader of the Opposition said that, to give credit where credit is due&mdash;that is, credit to the government&mdash;he would continue to agitate for us to provide proper drought relief. That is fine. He said that politics should be kept out of drought and that it should be above politics. Clearly, that message has not been communicated to both his frontbenchers and backbenchers in the Senate, because it is used for point scoring on a daily basis in here. I agree with John Howard's sentiments on that, which are being ignored in here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from supporting our policy and saying, `Give credit where credit is due,' he also said that after the election they will sit with farmers, look at the speech and talk about putting a drought policy together.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just after eight o'clock yesterday morning a story appeared on the Australian Associated Press wire, the AAP wire. The three-paragraph story, which was marked `low priority', reported that John Howard would officially open the Cattlemen's Union annual convention in Roma. Clearly I was interested in this and interested in following it up. The story went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Mr Howard, who would give his keynote speech at 10.30 a.m., was expected to outline the coalition's rural policies,' organisers said.</PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly! If that was the expectation&mdash;and it is the first time I can recall since I have been here that the Leader of the Opposition has appeared at a major rural function and clearly people expected him to outline rural policies of the coalition&mdash;they were sadly disappointed, as the speech that Senator Crane has tabled will demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal opposition leader in fact did not articulate any rural policies; he did exactly the reverse. He dumped the official coalition policy, which is the only one in any detail that I know of that has been released since the last election. There can be no question, Senator Crane, that this is what happened yesterday. The federal opposition leader in his speech acknowledged the presence of the Deputy Leader of the National Party at the Roma function, but he pointedly gave no acknowledgment at all&mdash;he did not even mention&mdash;to the detailed drought policy the National Party deputy leader released a year ago tomorrow. It did not get a mention. The Leader of the Opposition clearly is completely unaware that it even exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not something that you can easily forget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bob Collins rarely gets to the essence of a question when answering questions in question time, and today is no exception. In his usual flamboyant and expectedly pious way he has rewritten history to his own advantage. If ever the public needed evidence that the government in Canberra has become isolated from the rest of Australia in relation to the help that is so sorely needed in rural areas, it is the government's inaction after four long years in relation to drought policy. Senator Collins is leaving the chamber after making some of the biggest misrepresentations we have heard in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After four long years the government was dragged kicking and screaming to produce a drought policy which, I point out, picked the eyes out of the coalition's policy. It was not until the coalition laid down a policy in this regard that the government actually put down its policy. Prior to that it relied on RAS as the cornerstone of its drought policy. We all know that that scheme had become inefficient and log jammed. A Senate inquiry was established just to untangle all the difficulties and bureaucracy surrounding that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to this policy, RAS was the only drought policy the government had in place. Let us not forget that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ignored the drought for four long years before saying that he had noticed that the National Party was running around saying that he should be standing in a paddock in some drought affected area. He then make the immortal comments that `Drought is all around Australia. It is a quite normal recurrence of rural life'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I also thank the government for its indication that it would cooperate in bringing on this important issue, even if it disagrees with the content. There is probably no more important matter that the Senate could be debating today than the lack of economic confidence in the minds of most Australians concerned about their economic future. I guess their concern flows from the fact that, under this government, they experienced the worst recession that we have had in 60 years, the highest interest rate since the last war and the appalling spectacle of over one million Australians unemployed&mdash;all to be followed by what has been so aptly described as a recovery of five minutes of sunshine, a moment or two of hope that things were going to be better for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now what we find is a rapidly deteriorating public confidence. In a few months time, Australians will be asked to judge the performance of this government over the last nearly 13 years. What they will look back upon is a miserable economic legacy. They will look back upon wages and salaries, with living standards actually deteriorating in real terms. They will look back upon what we have had in terms of mass unemployment. Certainly, they will remember the brief glimmer of hope that they had in the early days of the recovery that things would be better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now they will reflect upon a whole series of economic results that suggest their future is far from bright. The last of those results is as current as today. What we had today was, for the 11th month in succession, a current account deficit exceeding $2 billion. The June-July current account deficit was in actual terms just over $2 1/2 billion, in seasonally adjusted terms just over $2 billion and in trend terms&mdash;which is perhaps the most important&mdash;still at a figure of $2 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, that is 11 months in a row with over $2 billion of deficit and one further month with the deficit just a fraction under $2 billion. July was the first time in 19 months, since December 1993, that the figure has not registered a deterioration. In other words, up until June we had had 18 consecutive months of deterioration. This is the recovery post the recession and post the time of misery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the trend figure, the improvement this month is only slight&mdash;about one per cent. When the final figures come out, there may still be a deterioration. So one month's slight improvement cannot disguise or conceal the deterioration that we have had over the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, imports are still growing faster than exports. Imports in the 12 months to July grew by 18.5 per cent on the trend; exports, by 12.9 per cent on the trend. Within imports, consumption goods are growing faster than capital goods. Consumption goods in the 12 months to July grew by 15.6 per cent; capital goods in the 12 months to July grew by 12.7 per cent. The deficit on merchandise trade nearly doubled during the 12-month period&mdash;it rose by 84 per cent&mdash;and the deficit on services rose by 77 per cent. Depressing figures, I regret to say, but figures upon which this government will be judged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the improvements in July, there are disconcerting features apparent in those numbers. Even though there was a marked improvement in the merchandise trade deficit during that month, within imports there was a nine per cent increase in consumption goods while capital goods fell by 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, this current account deficit is not new. This government has budgeted this year for a current account deficit of $27 billion. That is on top of last year's current account deficit of $27 billion, and is only marginally less than the 6.1 per cent that this country was running at, also when Mr Keating was pulling the levers, back in 1986. We all remember the warning that he issued at that time, that these figures could not continue without Australia in fact becoming a banana republic. So we have gone from 1986 to 1995, and the same figures are recurring. This government will now be pleased that no longer do we have the worst set of figures in all of the OECD; apparently, Australia is now the third highest. No longer can we say that our figures are even worse than Mexico's&mdash;but, regrettably, they are not much better. This is a result of excessive spending and insufficient savings and, of course, it must be seen against a rapid escalation in the rate of our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the debt was, in net terms, $23 billion. It has now risen to some $163 billion. This is the legacy that this government will take to the next election: our external accounts running at a massive and continuing deficit with no real sign of any significant improvement at all in the trend, again approximately in the terms the government was presenting to the people back in 1986, and a foreign debt situation that has deteriorated so appallingly from some $23 billion to $163 billion. It is not surprising, in those circumstances, that so many Australians feel unsure and lacking in confidence about their economic future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all translates in due course into figures that affect Australians in their everyday lives. It translates into figures of high, and continuing high, interest rates&mdash;and a worry in fact that they will go higher. Despite the denials of this government, Australian interest rates, as a consequence of the economic policies of this government, are about the highest that can be found in the Western world. It is not surprising, therefore, that particularly small business finds it so difficult to compete in an international market when their interest rates are as high as any that occur in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if you work off the prime bank rate&mdash;and I know the government will search for another figure&mdash;we are right up at the top of the table, equal with Italy, with the highest rates in the developed world. It is not just small business that suffers as interest rates go up, of course; it is home buyers and families as well. We have the very disturbing situation at the moment where families are struggling&mdash;struggling to pay high interest rates, and interest rates that are going higher as many are coming out of what has been referred to as a one-year holiday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this government's inept economic management, people are actually seeing the value of their asset, their home, usually their principal asset, dropping. In those circumstances, not only when they have to find more to pay their interest bill each month but when they find their asset in some circumstances&mdash;and, regrettably, with an increasing occurrence&mdash;not exceeding the value of their debt, what they have had to borrow to buy the home, they become exceedingly worried about the future. So the picture, it seems, that this government will be taking to the Australian people at the next election will be one of rising interest rates because it is unable to manage the current account, and also, regrettably, one of rising inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that rising inflation would not occur, yet the underlying figures demonstrate, from the Reserve Bank's recent figures, that the government has failed in that regard. We had such eminent persons as Mr Phillips, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, last week expressing his concern to the government. So we find inflation going up, interest rates going up, and the economic future for most Australians highly uncertain. There is very little doubt that they will take out their revenge on this government as a result of that economic failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, this is one in a row of opposition MPIs that we in this chamber have become used to. It is a matter of public importance placed on the agenda paper by the opposition to try to peddle the big lie about the Australian economy, to try to undermine what is still very strong confidence in the Australian economy, and to try to put in the minds of consumers that they have worries where worries do not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should any of my remarks be attacked, let me go to the concluding points of the last speaker, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill). The two issues he touched on were interest rates and inflation. He touched on them with the purpose of trying to massage anxiety in the electorate, to talk down the economy, to ignore the strength of the fundamentals of this economy, and to peddle dreariness and a lack of confidence as ways in which he believes he can talk down the strength of this government in the eyes of the electorate so as to try to somehow stumble to electoral victory on the back of, as I say, a big economic lie. I am sure when I conclude my speech that we will hear again from Senator Short who, in his dreary, stumbling manner, practises this art in this chamber as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, there are two strong things that those listening to this broadcast should bear in mind. The first is that the fundamentals of this economy are indeed very strong. In world terms we are looking at an extremely healthy economy. The second thing that we should bear in mind about this speech is that the opposition approached this debate with a series of platitudes which they claim as policy. In fact, that policy is bankrupt, that policy is sterile. But that policy has one part of it which is creating massive anxiety in Australia, and rightly, and that is the industrial relations element of that policy. I will say more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the point of national savings, let me not allow the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, to pass when he talks about the need to accumulate a level of national savings. We have a scheme to do that, and it is working: national savings are abuilding. We have that through the surplus the budget will deliver in outgoing years. As well, we have it because of our national superannuation scheme and the funds that that will generate in the economy. That will create a medium-term level of national savings able to generate investment for Australia so that we, a country traditionally investment hungry, will be a country that is an investor in the world, not a country that seeks investment from the world. That is what our scheme is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition policy on superannuation is a policy that will kill superannuation in this country stone dead, and it will do it in a manner which will undercut any coherent national savings scheme. The opposition cannot speak with any credibility in any public fora anywhere in this country on superannuation or on national savings because their policy settings, as we know them to be, will deny Australians dignity in retirement and will also reduce the level of national savings capable of being generated under the policies that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI was created in anticipation of today's current account figures. It was created by the opposition's gloomy self-belief in the expectation that the figures would be worse than the market anticipated, or would be at the level that the market anticipated. Of course, the figures have come in today, delivered here by the Statistician, better than the market anticipated. We see that the July result was $431 million, or 17 per cent lower than the revised result of the previous month, and we see that the July outcome included the first decrease in the monthly trend estimate of the current account deficit since December 1993. With those results being returned, we see that the forecasts we have made about the direction of change in the economy are beginning to show through, at least in this first instalment of the figures, and that the trend is for further improvement because the trend line is in this direction for improvement. So the basis for this MPI has been somehow cut from underneath the opposition because the theory of gloom that they had generated in their own mind was not realised by the facts. Reality bit the opposition in these figures; the opposition did not exploit reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about our performance with respect to the OECD, and Senator Hill tries to make an art form of this. In 1994 in terms of real GDP Australia ranked as the third highest country in the OECD. We had the third highest growth rate of any country in the OECD according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">OECD Outlook</EMPHASIS> publication No. 57. Of the 24 most advanced countries in the world, Australia in growth terms ranked at No. 3. In investment terms, real total gross fixed capital formation, in 1994 Australia was ranked of the 24 OECD countries as the third highest. In inflation with the GDP deflators, Australia was ranked of the 24 OECD countries as having the fourth lowest level of inflation. In growth in the labour force, Australia of the 24 OECD countries was rated as having the fourth highest growth in labour force participation in that period. In employment growth&mdash;in the ability to generate new jobs, offer hope, employment and better living standards for its citizens&mdash;of the 24 OECD countries Australia was ranked as equal second. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In general government outlays as a share of GDP&mdash;that is, in government expenditure&mdash;how does Australia rate in the world, given the rantings of the opposition? Among our peers we have the third lowest outlays of any government in the developed countries of the world. That is indeed an enviable record that the others aspire to. In general government current receipts as a share of GDP&mdash;or, broadly put, the level of income we gather mostly from taxation&mdash;Australia is the third lowest country in the OECD; that is, we are a low taxing country. In general government net debt interest on payments&mdash;that is, on government borrowings&mdash;what is our debt repayment? Of the 24 most developed countries in the world, Australia is equal fourth lowest&mdash;a sign of a very well managed public sector. These are fair comparisons between OECD figures. One ought to bear all of that performance in mind before conducting the economic sabotage that we have become used to from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have strong growth rates in Australia. In the last year we had 4.75 per cent which was strong and sustainable and in the year in view we will have 3.75 per cent. Tomorrow I am sure we will get a report from the Statistician in the national accounts which will show 16 consecutive quarters of sustained economic growth, one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth we have had since the Statistician kept these figures. We will be looking at a period of several years of continuing high levels of growth. We will be doing it against a low inflation background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great achievements of this government is to break the inflation stick. We are now going through, historically, one of the lowest periods of inflation that Australia has enjoyed. Importantly, we are enjoying low inflation against a background of high growth. The normal situation is that inflation rises, but we have kept it down. We will keep the underlying rate of inflation over the period between our target set by the Reserve Bank, supported by the Accord, committed to by the trade unions of Australia and aimed at by this government, between two and three per cent. The opposition never achieved that. In all its period of government in the most recent period it showed that it cannot do that. We have done that, and that is one of the great strengths of this economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, in jobs growth in the last year 380,000 jobs or more than 1,000 jobs a day were created by this government, delivering on its commitment of more than half a million jobs. We exceeded that. We created 618,000 jobs, and unemployment is now down to 8.1 per cent. Through the Accord, working with the major forces in our community, we have in view an ability to create 600,000 new jobs in the upcoming period. Business investment is 15 per cent, which is a very high level for Australia. I was at the Australia-Japan ministerial council meeting talking to the Australian and Japanese ministers on Friday. The new Prime Minister of Japan was there. The Japanese commended Australia on its ability to generate this high level of business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports are running at very high levels. Elaborately transformed manufactures are at 13 per cent, and the level of taxation is among the lowest in the OECD. Against this background, one ought to come to the issue of the current account deficit because it has taken some attention here. The major reason why we are confident, why the business community is confident, why the economic commentators are confident and why most Australians should be confident that the current account deficit will fall as we have forecast in this coming budget by half a per cent of GDP is that our budget this year is in surplus. Our budget in the outgoing years is in surplus less asset sales and will grow in greater surplus. So we will be accumulating public savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, we have a superannuation scheme which will give Australians dignity in retirement&mdash;something that the opposition has withheld from them and withheld it on a fair, equitable basis. We will provide that but we will do so out of a pool of national savings generated by superannuation. In our period of office, living standards have risen 40 per cent on a household disposable income per capita basis&mdash;40 per cent in real living standards. What is the opposition's position with regard to all of this? While presenting the credentials of the government, one ought to contrast it with the lack of credentials of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last indication we have had of what might be something that passes for an economic policy from the opposition was the so-called second headland speech. What did it propose to do as a major vision in this country for the economy? It proposed three bodies of government economic advice and the amalgamation of them into one called the productivity council, and that would solve the problem. What a joke! There is no economist out there who believes that is any sort of solution. The opposition also said that it was going to cut government outlays. In the last session of parliament when we were getting the budget through, the opposition wanted to cut government outlays and voted in this chamber to do so. But the opposition now says to the public that it wants to increase outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You voted to increase expenditure in the last session of parliament, and you have promised every interest group through each of your shadow ministers new expenditure which totals $9 billion on top of what is in the budget now. You say that you will cut expenditure. Where will you cut it? Of course you will cut it in health. You will demolish the health system of this country. Of course you will cut it in education. You will decrease the education funding, put Australians who are now in education out of education and lower the levels of education in this country. You will cut welfare payments, where Australians in a position unable to defend themselves will be denied the necessary support and the public compassion that a responsible government should demonstrate for those who are in an unfortunate situation in life. That is where you will cut it. There is no escaping that as a fundamental thrust of your policy. Those are indeed the implications of Mr Howard's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then you talk about micro-economic reform. As everyone in each state of Australia where there is a Liberal government knows, that is code for putting people in public employment on the scrap heap and out of work with no future, without improving the micro-efficiency of the economy at all. That is what you have done in Western Australia. That is what you are doing in South Australia. That is what you have done in Victoria. That is what you did in New South Wales under a Liberal government, and that is what you would do federally if you were in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing is your industrial relations policy. You believe that your industrial relations policy will improve things. But no-one else believes that. The Confederation of WA Industry&mdash;a very conservative body&mdash;does not believe that. The mining companies of Western Australia do not believe that; the independent commentators in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, a conservative paper, do not believe that. All have said so; all have said that your industrial relations policies are a disaster and would exacerbate the current account because we would have a lack of confidence in this country by our international trading partners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are being told that Australians do not have confidence in our future. We are asking why. The government says we have never had it better; we are moving into the economic nirvana of a low inflation recovery. Senator Cook has told us that 618,000 new jobs have been created since 1993, but he did not tell us that over half of them were part-time jobs. There were record exports in July and there have been 16 quarters of positive economic growth. You cannot say that these are not achievements, because they are achievements and they should not be dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underpinning those achievements is the government's Achilles heel; that is, the highest current account deficit in the OECD. We as a nation are spending $106 for every $100 we earn. Really, 12 years of Mr Keating&mdash;whether as Treasurer or Prime Minister&mdash;have failed to fix this chronic problem. We have heard the government crying&mdash;perhaps with a bit of relief, I suspect&mdash;about today's current account deficit. After the $3 billion peak in May, we are now down to $2.1 billion. We are heading in the right direction, thank goodness; but we still have the eighth highest monthly deficit on record. </PARA>
<PARA>Within the current account there are two clear problems. While exports are rising so are imports, especially&mdash;as others have said today&mdash;consumption goods imports. In July, consumption goods jumped nine per cent while capital goods fell nine per cent. That means that fewer of our imports are for business investment and many more are for household consumption. Increasingly, if you look at the evidence, Australians are using borrowings to fund those imports. In the last three years household borrowing has exploded. Housing finance is up by 70 per cent and personal finance is up by 13 per cent, while lending to business has remained static. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a previous debate in this place I recall the government telling us that we should not worry because this is all self-managing. But our household savings ratio has fallen. It is a third of the level it was a decade ago. That is despite the superannuation guarantee charge system's introduction. Government spending has also increased, as this government has failed to meet its spending commitments with fully funded revenue and expenditure measures. So with this debt explosion feeding into the current account, our interest rates have been pushed up. They are at the highest level in the Western world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking the question: are Australians confident about their economic future? At one level, the growing levels of household debt suggest people are very confident&mdash;too confident perhaps&mdash;about their economic future. Either that or they still very strongly believe that `she'll be right'. I think this is something that is quite prevalent in government policy circles as well as in the Australian psyche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to say, though, in terms of this matter of public importance, that it is all the government's fault; that it can all be laid at the feet of Paul Keating. Because when you look at the big policy decisions of the last 12 years, what do you see? Financial deregulation&mdash;the opposition supported it with bells on. Ludicrous unilateral tariff reduction&mdash;the opposition supported it. There have been second thoughts, though, from both since then. Competition policy, as yet an untried and unproven wind-back of government&mdash;the opposition voted for it. Enterprise bargaining&mdash;the opposition suggested it. Asset sales, tighter monetary policy&mdash;the opposition voted and called for it. The point I would make is that, so far, there has not been a definitive policy difference except for the GST, which is now buried, we are told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pollsters tell us that Australians despair of our political system. They despair of our behaviour this week, in particular, but they also feel that issues are so complex and the options provided by the government and opposition are so similar that they feel a little powerless. In response, across the country, voters are lashing out at whoever is in power&mdash;Labor or Liberal. What Australians want to hear is not more oversell and hyperbole from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about how good it is and how we have never had it better. They also do not want to hear a constant whingeing recitation from Mr Costello about how bad it is, promising that micro-economic reform will solve everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australians want to know, I think, from both government and opposition, what they want to feel confidence in, is that there is a clear plan in place to attack our chronic current account problem. They want to have confidence that Australia's economic future will be decided here in Australia and not in the boardrooms of the foreign bankers and investors who own or control an increasing share of our country and economy. Until the opposition tells us their master plan to deal with this and while we can certainly say Mr Keating's government has failed, we cannot yet say that the opposition should not share some of the blame. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is about the failure of the government's economic policy. That failure is dramatically illustrated today by the release of yet another disastrous current account deficit monthly figure, yet another figure over $2,000 million. This is the ninth month in a row where we have had a deficit on the current account of over $2 billion. We have had a deficit of over $2 billion in all but one of the last 13 months. We now have a total net foreign debt, as at March this year, of $167 billion, a figure that is just mind-boggling and beyond the comprehension, probably, of most Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt build-up under Labor has been absolutely massive. We have had a current account deficit in every year of Labor's reign. We now have a foreign debt which is being added to by more than the debt was when Labor came to office. When they came to office the debt was $23 billion. After 195 years we had built up a debt of $23 billion. We are now adding to the foreign debt a figure each year that exceeds that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95 the foreign deficit was $27 billion; and it is going to be another $27 billion this year. That is more than the total debt was after 195 years when this government came to office. It is a disastrous record of which this government should be utterly ashamed. The current account deficit problem is the best indicator of how hopeless this government's economic management is. To the great chagrin of Labor members, voters do understand this problem. I think the Labor Party is operating on the presumption that voters do not really understand anything about the current account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very interesting poll in the 1 August <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. It published some results of questions voters were asked about the current account. It showed that voters rate the size of the current account deficit as the fourth most important problem facing voters as they go to vote. As an issue it is beaten only by health, education and unemployment which, of course, are also very significant problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voters were asked how aware they are of the size of the current account deficit. Some 65 per cent said they are well aware of it. Then they were asked how well they understand the term `current account deficit' and 62 per cent said they understand it very well. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poll reveals that voter concern about Australia's record current account deficit is very high . . . respondents rate it higher than interest rates as an issue of great importance.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem for Labor backbenchers is shown by the reporter saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privately, backbenchers say they have been banking on voter ignorance about the current account . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This poll gives the lie to that idea and should send a chill through every Labor backbencher when voters go to the polls, because voters clearly understand the problem. The government well understands the problem of the current account and that is why Keating made his infamous banana republic speech in 1986. He understands the problem but, nine years later, it is even worse than it was when he said we were going down the path of becoming a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The tragedy is that in 1990 Mr Keating himself deliberately engineered the worst recession we have had in 60 years in order to deal with the current account problem. That is apparently why we had to have the recession&mdash;to deal with the current account problem. We have had the recession. The recession laid waste to the Australian economy and to the lives of ordinary Australians, it ruined thousands upon thousands of small businesses, drove thousands of Australians out of their homes and wrecked the lives of a lot of Australians. For what? Why did we have this recession? What have we achieved as a result of having the recession which Mr Keating said we had to have? We have gained absolutely nothing from that recession. All we have done is lose&mdash;lose the lives and businesses of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt problem is now worse than before. It is worse than when the recession came into effect. The legacy of all this is that we have, as Senator Hill pointed out, the highest nominal interest rates in the world&mdash;and probably the highest real interest rates. Many of us read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. The latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> has a chart on interest rates. As Senator Hill pointed out, the prime bank rate for Australia is 11 1/2 per cent. The only other country with an interest rate anything like that is Italy, which also has a rate of 11 1/2 per cent. All of the other countries are much lower. The economy of Britain has a level of only 7 3/4 per cent and Japan only two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have horrendously high interest rates and they are a direct result of this government's economic mismanagement and of the problem of the current account debt. Ross Gittins made this point recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Most voters do understand the current account deficit, but they also understand the consequences. Ross Gittins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in fact, is the main way that the current account deficit and high foreign debt affect our daily lives: they cause the interest rates we pay on home loans and everything else to be higher than they'd otherwise be.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the legacy for Labor. That is the problem for ordinary Australian voters caused by the debt which has been built up by this government and by its inadequate response to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is our real message to the government. The government have failed to come to grips with the size of this problem. They tried killing it with a recession&mdash;it did not work. They have failed to come up with the policy response to deal with this problem, which is underpinning our high interest rates. There really is a universal view among economists about what has to be done and about the failure of this government to take the course which must be followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fixing this current account deficit problem does require a range of measures. It primarily requires labour market reform. As I say, there is universal agreement through the corporate community, the finance community and market economists that the fact that this government is in hock to the trade union movement and will not deal with this issue of labour market reform is preventing Australia dealing with the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no attempt to reform the tax system. The tax system is worse, more complicated, more difficult and more inhibiting of investment and business activity than it was when Labor came to power. They refuse to deal with tax reform. Reform of federal-state financial relations has hit a wall. Nothing is happening on that front. Those are the three principal areas where action must be taken if we are to deal with the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced that the superannuation policy is going to fix everything. If we let the government get carried away with its hyperbole on superannuation policy, it would probably say that the policy would fix the drought. The problem with the government's rhetoric on this is that it seems to me the government is ignoring all the other policy areas where it should be acting because it is putting all its eggs in the basket of superannuation policy. It is not clear that superannuation policy will add significantly to savings. It is blinding the government to the need for reform in all the other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record on economic management is one of boom-bust. We go from boom to bust, and it looks like we are heading for another bust. Interest rates and inflation are heading up&mdash;the former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank recently warned about inflation and the problems of high interest rates. But there was never more true a statement than John Howard's statement that, under this government, after the recession we have had five minutes of economic sunshine and now it is back down to the bust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly will, Senator. I am glad you are listening so carefully. By any measure, I think it has to be said, the Australian economy now is in far superior health than it was at the beginning of 1983. Let me take you back to the circumstances that this government inherited. We inherited a state of stagflation. That is not a word that has been heard in this chamber very often in recent times because it simply does not apply to this government. Stagflation is low growth, high inflation and high unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what this government inherited from the Howard coalition. Any sort of comparison will demonstrate that. Inflation was running at 11.5 per cent when John Howard handed over the economy. It is currently running at 4.5 per cent and in an underlying rate it has been running at 2.5 per cent for the last three years. That is the state of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at growth, the case is absolutely clear. Economic growth averaged 2.6 per cent under senators opposite. It has averaged 3.4 per cent under this government. Let us nail the lie now about this so-called five minutes of economic sunshine. Exactly what is this five minutes of economic sunshine? I will tell you what it is. In the September quarter of 1994, the economy grew at an annual rate of 6.1 per cent. Anybody who believes that that is economic sunshine is an economic madman. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was referring to when he said `economic sunshine'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anybody believes that is economic sunshine, they are willing to ignore all of the bottlenecks that that creates in the economy; they are willing to ignore the scramble for labour at any price; they are prepared to ignore asset price inflation, which is an inevitable conclusion; and they are prepared to ignore the diversion of goods from export markets to the domestic markets, which always happens when you run the economy at an unsustainable rate of growth. That is exactly what we had during that period. Anybody who believes that that is economic sunshine is simply an economic speed junkie. You would have to run the economy on amyl nitrite full time to get that sort of growth. It is absolutely unsustainable, and that is why everyone, including senators opposite, should be proud of the growth rate which the government has now been able to sustain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) has already given a clear indication of this government's strength in its enormous creation of jobs&mdash;618,000 jobs have been created in its term. What did senators opposite manage to produce? In their whole term of government they produced 400,000 jobs. The creation of jobs was a central promise of this government at the time of the last election and it has been absolutely delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the balance of payments, which senators opposite seek to make so much about, I refer them to a recent article I put in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 31 June 1995 in which I identify the four great lies that members opposite are keen to tell. It is a lie, an absolute lie, to say that the balance of payments is Paul Keating's fault. Listen to this particular quote, Senator Herron, from the article. You might learn something. You might even remember this, Senator. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is undeniable that Australia has become dependent to some considerable degree on overseas investment to make good deficits on the current balance of payments and we can see little prospect that this will be changed.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Vernon committee in 1965. You might have voted for Robert Menzies. It was his problem. It has been a continuing feature of the Australian economy that there are deficits on the current account. It is not Paul Keating's fault. It is not anybody else's fault. It is a continuing feature of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 2, which you are so often keen to trot out, is that our balance of payments is worse than it has ever been. I think Senator Cook showed quite clearly that, by any reasonable measure, the external account is improving under this government. But one particular feature which I think is relevant is the ratio of imports to exports. The ratio of imports to exports was 81.4 per cent under senators opposite. It is now running at 90.2 per cent. In other words, our export performance is outstripping our import performance by any reasonable sort of measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 3 about the balance of payments is that we cannot compete. Ten years ago Australia imported five times more manufactured goods than we exported. In just 10 years we have halved that because our exports have outstripped our imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 4 is that Australia is slowly being strangled by foreign debt. The fact of the matter is, as you may remember, Senator, that selling off the farm used to be the cry under your government. The point now is that debt has simply swapped from equity. There has been no change in terms of our external position. What has changed is that this government has brought in savings policies which will overwhelmingly address the problem that we are faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Savings policy is the thing that is going to make a difference, about which we hear nothing from the opposition. Why doesn't the sunshine shine on your policies? If you want to bring anything into the sunshine, why don't we see what you are going to do about it? The answer is that you are going to do nothing. You are incapable of producing any policies. You are terrified to bring them out into the sunshine. That is why we do not hear about them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In joining this debate very briefly, I fully support the statement by Senator Hill, which is the topic for today, that the government's economic performance has progressively eroded confidence in this country, with great damage to inflation, to jobs and to the living standards of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, let me deal with some of the points and assertions made by Senator Cook and Senator Wheelwright. Senator Cook claimed that inflation in Australia now was amongst the lowest in the Western world and that we would be maintaining that at an underlying rate of between two and three per cent. No-one believes the latter point. There is no doubt at all that there are significant inflationary pressures in the economy which are pointing inexorably to an increase in inflation over the next year or so, and the prospect of the government maintaining a two to three per cent underlying inflation rate is not believed by anyone other than the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook talked about the level of interest rates in Australia. Senator Hill and Senator Minchin, for the coalition, said the fact is that real interest rates in Australia today are virtually the highest in the Western world. That, of course, has an enormous impact on investment, jobs and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook made a big deal out of the fact that the balance of payments figure for the month of July released today&mdash;$2.1 billion&mdash;seemed okay because it was 17 per cent less than the balance of payments out in June. I might point out that the June figure was the second worst monthly account deficit ever recorded in this country. So God help us if we did not get an improvement on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth in Australia is amongst the slowest in recovery. Indeed, the growth rate that we have now so far as recovery from the recession is the lowest recovery growth rate from a recession that we have ever had in Australia. In all previous recessions the growth rate has been sustained at a considerably higher rate than has been the case with the recovery from this recession. It is true that there have been 16 quarters of positive economic growth, but that economic growth has been lamentably low compared with the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's get on to the great furphy of jobs and all these 600,000 jobs that have been created. The simple fact is that the total level of full-time employment in Australia, with all the growth in the available labour force that has occurred in the last six years, in June 1995 was 45,000 higher than the average of 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in five years there has been a growth of 45,000 in the actual number of people employed, despite the fact that the available work force has increased by hundreds of thousands. Indeed, looking at the male employment figure in Australia today, there are 65,000 fewer full-time males employed in Australia today than there were in 1989-90. Admittedly, there are 110,000 more females, and that is good, but those figures are absolutely appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Australians have lost confidence in their economic future and that is a great tragedy because we have so much going for us in this country. We have our people with all their skills, talents and initiatives, resources and our location within the fastest growing region on earth. Despite all of that, we still have some 800,000 Australians unemployed. The best that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can do is to tell those students who are concerned about their futures, `Go and get a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our economic growth lags behind what it ought to be on an historical basis. Our productivity is growing at less than half the rate that it was in the 1960s and the 1970s. Our foreign debt is virtually the highest of any country on earth and has grown seven-fold since Labor came to power in 1983, from a figure of about $23,000 million then to a figure of a staggering $170,000 million today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our inflation rate is moving up. Our real interest rates are amongst the highest in the world and our savings rate is at a record low. All of those things are encapsulated in our accounts with the rest of the world, that is, our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we saw, with the release of the July balance of payments figures, the ninth successive monthly balance of payments deficit of $2 billion or more and the 12th in 13 months. Do you know what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said in the House of Representatives today about the figures? He said, `They are very welcome figures.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the Treasurer are so out of touch with reality and so deluded that they think that a balance of payments figure, an inability to balance our accounts in any one month, of more than $2 billion is a welcome figure.

When we do get growth, it turns into jobs and it does not create a wages outbreak, which occurred under your last administration and which would occur if you ever got back into office. What you would see then is a wages break-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state of Western Australia, we never technically went into recession. The only thing that is preventing a wages break-out is the accord and the economic settings that this government has put in place. With the demand for skilled labour, you would see an enormous wages break-out. That is the real danger to this economy and this economic recovery. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AMENDMENT (CONTROLLED OPERATIONS) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 19 April 1995 the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v The Queen. By a majority of 6-1 the court decided that where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in unlawful conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need be established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that is now before the Senate responds to that judgment. The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty. The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people, both in the chamber and in the community, might ask: why should we sanction the police participating in criminal activity?  Won't this activity lead to the entrapment of people?  Won't it be an inducement for the committing of crimes that would otherwise not occur?  They might say that there are many dangers in sanctioning these covert operations. I will respond to each of these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drug crime is peculiarly difficult to combat. Rarely are there complainants about this conduct. The importation of large quantities of drugs is a clandestine criminal activity involving complicity, or participants who will remain silent for fear of retribution. Organised crime does not tolerate complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values such as equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally however there is the right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption that it can spawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. It must be borne in mind that loss of confidence in law enforcement will lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. This is not such a bill. The choice before us is between a society prepared to accept balanced legislation to counter criminals, and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill lays down a full and open system of accountability. The bill requires that the responsible Minister, at present myself, is kept informed of all applications for the authority to conduct a controlled operation. In turn, the responsible Minister is required to table a report in Parliament providing details of the applications made under the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure will not lead to `entrapment' of people. A controlled operation may be conducted only in circumstances where the targets of the operation are likely to import (or export) narcotics whether or not the operation takes place. The bill will ensure that it will not be permissible for officers to procure the commission of offences which otherwise would not have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law as regards accepting or rejecting evidence obtained by improper methods will be maintained. However controlled operations may lead to the detection of principals whose activities might otherwise never be discovered, let alone prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should emphasise that controlled operations are an internationally accepted investigatory technique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 February 1993 the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances came into force in Australia. That Convention was implemented by legislation that commenced operation that same day. Article 11(1) of the Convention provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 11&mdash;Controlled delivery</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. If permitted by the basic principles of their respective domestic legal systems, the parties shall take the necessary measures, within their possibilities, to allow for the  appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, and to taking legal action against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article indicates the recognition by the international community of the need to employ specialised investigative techniques, like the controlled operation, to deal with organised and sophisticated traffickers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct (commonly known as the Fitzgerald report) also discussed the use of new techniques in combating organised crime. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that an effective response to organised crime is dependent upon recognition of four factors:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the social changes which crime causes and the fact that it diminishes the quality of life;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the fact that crime escalates if it is not controlled;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognition that there are vulnerabilities in the social order which expose it to exploitation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the steps that are needed to control crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the latter point (the steps that are needed to control crime) Commissioner Fitzgerald stated that consideration should be given to a wide range of measures which would equip law enforcement agencies with new powers including permitting `the infiltration of criminal groups'. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that orthodox policing is quite unable to enforce the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will  ensure that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have available to them the controlled operation as a tool in the investigation of the trade in narcotics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable Senators may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence. How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be `an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that `in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen.' The enactment of the bill now before the Senate will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, the trigger for the exclusion of evidence will not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importation (or exportation) of the prohibited narcotics. This will ensure that the importation or exportation itself is not made lawful, thereby exonerating the targets of the operation who planned the conspiracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to describe the effect of the bill upon prosecutions that are current at the time the bill commences operation. There are a number of investigations that are affected by the decision in Ridgeway. They all involve very significant participation in trafficking in narcotics, for example:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conspiracy to import 7 kg of cocaine (one individual);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being knowingly concerned in the importation of 3.8 kg of cocaine (two individuals);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conspiracy to import 7 kg of cocaine (one individual); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being knowingly concerned in the importation of, and possession of, 2 kg of heroin (two individuals).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controlled operations were employed in each of these matters. These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. They were not operations involving out of control cowboys riding roughshod over our laws. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a Ministerial agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ministerial agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State (having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police) Senator the Honourable Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service) Senator the Honourable John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once that agreement was obtained the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines. These guidelines run to fifty paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These operations were conducted pursuant to these guidelines. The operations were closely monitored. Each of the accused alleged to have been detected as a result of these controlled operations are entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. But without the passage of this legislation those trials will have to be abandoned. I believe the community would not see that to be a just outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the Mr Bigs, not just apprehend couriers and the dealers on our street corners. Indeed the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them, and their children who are particularly vulnerable. This bill will satisfy that demand by providing a firm legislative basis for the use of controlled operations as a device in combating drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of the bill are described in the Explanatory Memorandum which I now present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC ORDER (PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become apparent that existing Commonwealth law does not adequately protect persons attending Federal Courts and tribunals. Currently police and other officers responsible for the safety of such persons do not have adequate protective powers to ensure a secure environment, particularly in circumstances where weapons and even explosive devices may be simply concealed in the clothing of a person, or in personal effects such as brief cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that it would be proper to provide legislative powers to assist Commonwealth courts to maintain security and protect the safety of both court staff and persons attending proceedings. Comparable legislation was enacted in Victoria in 1980 and Queensland in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Commonwealth courts have an inherent jurisdiction to control and protect persons in relation to proceedings, the scope is uncertain. Police have, for example, been unclear about their powers to assist in the removal of persons from Family Court premises. What powers are available to search persons entering a court for weapons? The Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 currently includes a statutory offence of refusing to leave Commonwealth premises without reasonable excuse when directed by a person with power to give such directions. This offence has limited application with respect to persons who are parties to court or tribunal proceedings (and who may have a `reasonable excuse' to disregard such an order), and it does not provide for associated security powers, such as searching for, and the detention of, firearms, explosive devices, and offensive weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative provisions are required to empower police and other authorised officials to take action in situations which raise a threat to the security of Federal courts and tribunals. The amendments to the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 propose a scheme of protective security, consistent with the electronic screening undertaken at the entrance to Parliament House and at airports but also allowing for `frisk' searches (in the nature of `pat down' search). Such screening is designed to identify security risks, while associated powers allow authorised officers to direct persons to leave the premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possession of weapons in the court environment constitutes a serious threat to the ability of courts to function as a public forum. This is most apparent with respect to the Family Court. The sad history of violence directed at Family Court judges and those involved in such proceedings is a constant reminder that security is an issue that should be taken seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the legislation is the result of concerns emanating from events in the Family Court, the amendments can be applied to all Federal courts or tribunals by regulation. The powers provided in the Act will not be available to all Federal courts and tribunals as a matter of course. Only such powers as are considered necessary by responsible officials having regard to the circumstances faced by a Federal court or tribunal in a particular location will be available. This means that the identification and management of security requirements will be initiated by the court or tribunal itself. Regulations will be made only at the request of the court or tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security powers provided in the legislation will be exercised by authorised officers. This term is defined to include police officers as well as persons who are authorised by the Attorney-General, or by courts empowered to administer their own affairs. This provision addresses the concern that police will have to be solely responsible for the implementation of various separate security regimes at diverse premises. By providing for the authorisation of court or security officers, responsible specifically for the security of particular sites, the police can be utilised more flexibly to deal only with serious breaches of security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Powers held by police and authorised officers may include requiring a person attending prescribed premises to provide his or her name, address, evidence of identity, and a reason for being on the premises. The legislation makes it clear that a wish to attend the proceedings of the court is an acceptable reason, and access will be available unless the person has not complied with the security arrangements in place at that court or tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is sensitive to the criticism that exercise of the powers will discourage members of the public from attending court cases and thus undermine the principle that justice should be dispensed in public. I reiterate that the Government is concerned to preserve the open and public administration of justice, whilst at the same time providing adequate protection to those participating in that administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been fortunate that violent attacks upon our judicial system have been few and far between. Unfortunately, apart from the well known incidence involving the Family Court, there have been occasions at the State and Territory level where people have been injured or killed in court buildings. Furthermore, recent tragic events in Oklahoma City remind us of the fragility and vulnerability of our open society. Governments have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety and security of those involved in our judicial system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulations will be made to govern the management of information gathered about persons attending court in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Airport Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Airport Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995. I see that the government has adopted another so-called `green tax'. This bill is designed to tax noise pollution at the Sydney airport. As in many cases, this tax is not designed to stop noise pollution. It will just make some money for the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill demonstrates just how cynical this government's so-called green taxes can actually be. It will add $32 million dollars to government coffers, and it will cost each passenger an extra $3.40 per trip. But the passengers will have little idea of the addition since, when they ask the cost of a ticket, this will presumably just be included on the ticket. In any case, a passenger to Sydney has no options. He or she is not going to go to Melbourne, either as good citizens trying to avoid having negative impacts on others&mdash;although they might in some cases choose not to go through Sydney as a connection&mdash;or in order to try to avoid paying the cost of a sandwich in an airport lounge. She or he has no control over what airports are available, at what airports the planes land, where the airports are, what level of housing exists or is planned around the airport, or which flight paths are dictated. None of these things are in the control of the passengers who will have to pay for any bad judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who do make the decisions&mdash;the Civil Aviation Authority, the state government and the Federal Department of Transport&mdash;are not going to have to pay. There will be no incentive, aside from popular political pressure, to change the decisions they have made or to provide better alternatives. A more effective method of fundraising might be to demand that the cost of amelioration of the problems is taken out of the budgets of the organisations who help create them. I will bet we would see stronger and more effective action a lot more quickly that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other people who pay in the most direct way possible are the residents who have to put up with the noise. I note that there is nothing here that indicates any guarantee or level of funding to address the problem. Nor is there any mention of what should be done about it. One thing the exmo for this bill did say is that, while the description of applicable airport only fits the Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney, it could be expanded. I wonder whether this is an indication that the government wants to raise more revenue and thinks this is a good way to do so, or whether this means that it foresees similar problems with other airports and in other cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, those on the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney have indicated that there are similar problems in other cities&mdash;Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth&mdash;where there are possible other runways planned. I notice that rather than address the real problem&mdash;that is, perhaps primarily the level of air transport used as opposed to other attractive forms of transport, to the extent perhaps of unnecessary air travel in Australia&mdash;we could, even in this parliament, make greater use of electronic transport. Rather than transporting people right across the country several times, perhaps in non-sitting periods, to appear before a committee, they could attend by way of televideo conferencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major issue is that flight paths have a huge impact and housing should not be planned under major flight paths. There should not be major flight paths over major areas of population. If you do have those things, you have got to be aware of the fact that that is part of the real cost of air travel and that cost should be built in. If it is not built in, then we have no means of ameliorating it. We have to realise that there is a cost associated with it and plan it in, instead of pretending it does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems themselves are horrific. We are talking about having to live in situations where frequent, intermittent noise of 80 to 90 decibels or higher becomes a fact of life. This level of noise shakes buildings and completely destroys amenity for the residents. It is awful enough on a visit&mdash;and I have been there&mdash;but imagine having to live on a continual basis with such noise. Let us look at what government seems willing to do about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The noise amelioration programs that this tax is supposed to pay for consist of putting noise insulation into houses of residents. Residents complain that the level of insulation originally promised has steadily declined. Not only is a lower standard to be installed, but the insulation does not cover key areas of sound entry. More importantly, apparently the insulation program does not cover the entire house. It only covers sleeping and relaxing rooms. There is apparently no intention of insulating rooms such as the kitchen and dining room. This could be equivalent to a whole area of Sydney being under permanent house arrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people will know that in a normal house, the kitchen is one of the most heavily used rooms, especially where there is a big kitchen built to accommodate a kitchen table. The kitchen is the room where you have breakfast in the morning, where the kids come in after school, where homework is done, and often where dinner is eaten. It is also a room used far more by women and children, so there are gender issues. Why is it considered a room where people have to put up with the noise of living under a runway?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole insulation plan is questionable. Evidence given to the committee is that the insulation plan is entirely uncoordinated. It seems to involve illegal installations and it is far more expensive than the government is willing to admit to, as well as being inadequate to ameliorate the noise. There are also problems of who does and who does not get insulation and who does and who does not get compensation. It seems that these kinds of decisions have been entirely arbitrary, based on straight lines, where you can get a person straight under the flight path getting insulation expenditure paid and the person next door not getting it. It is not that the person next door gets zero aircraft noise and the person who gets insulation gets 80 or 90 per cent of aircraft noise; or perhaps the person whose house gets bought out from under them gets compensation. It is not worked on a percentage basis. It is worked on an arbitrary, you get it or you don't basis, and there is a line drawn down the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence presented to the select committee on aircraft noise&mdash;I note especially the evidence at the end of the first of this month&mdash;is that the means of measuring aircraft sound appears to be averaged to guarantee that the figure is as much as 10 decibels lower than the actual noise for some of the aircraft, 10 decibels lower than the levels that people actually have to put up with. For those who are not familiar with decibels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale. As a result, the increase in sound of 10 decibels means the sound is 10 times higher. So an increase of 20 decibels means that it is 100 times higher. So the difference between the actual sound and the average amount used by the government is about 10 times louder in order of magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the level of insulation is not going to be calculated to ameliorate the actual noise. The actual noise will be 10 times louder than the noise the insulation was designed to ameliorate. As to the insulation strategy itself, we have already noted that commonly used and commonly lived in parts of the house, like the kitchen-dining room or the bathroom, will not be insulated. Those parts will get the full blast of sound. There will be no pleasant baths and making dinner will become a hellish torment. People will eat in their lounge rooms rather than put up with the noise&mdash;and even there they will hear the planes because the insulation is not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of the insulation program is to fill the roof with insulation, fill the walls, double seal the windows and make them unable to be opened, rip out any glass, any leadlighting, put in solid doors, seal them and seal all the edges. Basically, the plan is to create a hermetically sealed and insulated cocoon. How do people breathe?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government plans to put in forced draft ventilation. Unfortunately, this ventilation does not have the ability to heat and cool. Every 30 minutes or so it will replace the air in the house so that people do not suffocate. In winter, this means that all the warm air will be sucked out and replaced with fresh cold air. In summer, this means all the cooler air inside is periodically sucked out and replaced with the hot air from outside. From an energy efficiency standpoint, and from a comfort standpoint, any possible benefit from insulating the house will be completely cancelled by the ventilation system. It will be even worse in terms of heating and cooling than a uninsulated house in a normal suburb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ventilators require energy and cost money to run. Estimates run at between $1,000 and $2,000 per year. Think of the extra money that then has to be put in to a maintain a house at a decent temperature. Here is the killer: part of the insulation program consists of blocking any chimney or flues by filling them with insulation. If you have a fireplace or slow combustion heater you will have to find some other way to heat your house and you will have to use that device often because any air you heat will be cycled out of the vent every 30 minutes or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the ventilators are noisy. The ventilators often have no star ratings and seem to be of low quality, if those people who have made submissions are to be believed. One submission stated that schools got even lower quality ventilation to save money. It was also pointed out that the ventilators were so noisy that students could not study. The ventilators that let you breathe in these hermetically sealed rooms designed to reduce aircraft noise are so noisy that they have to be insulated separately, according to the evidence of Mr Clinton on page 807 of the select committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Clinton and others giving evidence during the hearings also noted that the insulation used gives off gases causing health problems. Some of it is flammable or potentially flammable and gives off high level toxic gases when burnt. In installations in the test areas, the electrical wiring was buried in a way that it could not be maintained. There was no upgrading of old electrical wiring to cope with the demand of the new ventilation and airconditioning systems and probably the increased use and application of power in heating and cooling the house. There is no plan for addressing the fact that some of the houses and buildings have asbestos roofs and other panels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Clinton also informed the committee that representatives of the fire brigade, Sydney Electricity in relation to the insulation and wiring, and CFMEU in relation to industrial safety, were all ignorant of the plans and had grave concerns about various aspects of the program and its implementation. We are talking about a major program. We are talking about some 4,200 houses, 72 schools, hospitals, churches and so on. This has not been given sufficient consideration. If we see the line the government takes as establishing a precedent, we are likely to see it repeated in other major cities developing similar problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It occurred to me when I was in Sydney that the major problem may not be the one that is immediately obvious. The problem may be that the land in those areas is becoming so unsaleable because of the implications of aircraft noise that some time in the future&mdash;considering the proposed sell-off of federal airports land&mdash;the land may well be very attractive. It seems to me that the people living in and around the areas that experience this aircraft noise may be pawns in a game that eventually may make the sale of Sydney airport more attractive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could perhaps operate a very attractive undercover commercial centre like those that have been suggested for some of the other airport sites around Australia. It would be interesting if in a few years from now that became part of the sale package. It would be very easy to get hold of the land from those people who have been treated so badly and have been forced to leave, have sold out, died or something as a result of the way this whole nasty business has been handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been big promises. Mr Brereton promised the world's best practice in noise amelioration. That has apparently been cut back to Australian standards and below. Corners have been cut wherever possible and the government now claims that it need not insulate parts of the houses that are basic to living. The costs imposed to maintain ventilation, heating and cooling are apparently massive. Estimates considered to be reasonably accurate show that the cost of the program is likely to be around $350 million, yet the solution appears to be really quite inadequate. It will make only part of people's houses uncomfortable but livable, while extensively increasing their power bills, making their houses possible fatal fire traps, exposing them to environmentally hazardous chemical emissions and rendering their electrical wiring effectively unserviceable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a solution. This is a very expensive bandaid applied to a major civic wound. What are people's options? They can sell up, leave their homes, leave their friends and leave their neighbourhoods which have often been chosen for convenience or other reasons. The government valuers are valuing people's properties at up to $100,000 less than those of independent valuers. Even when those valuers try to work  out the difference in valuation, the government estimates are still up to $50,000 less than those of independent valuers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that anyone wishing to sell to the government would not get enough to buy a comparable house in the region. No private buyer would move into that area and pay anything like a price similar to what they pay for a similar house not under a flight path. Why would they when they cannot use the yard or the kitchen and possibly cannot use the bathroom without putting up with full aircraft noise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a solution. There is no good effective method of amelioration in a situation like this short of building a huge biosphere over the area. A solution would involve stopping the flights over people's houses or at least paying enough compensation to allow people to make a decent exit from the area without losing much of their investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax is liable to be less than will cover the cost of even a decent go at the amelioration promised and planned. The Greens will support the levy because it is more or less sure to go to the amelioration programs. We put the government on notice that in our opinion this level of amelioration is not a solution; it is an excuse to continue to do stupid things. The levy is almost certainly inadequate to cover costs and we think the whole thing is a botched job from beginning to end and satisfies no-one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in this debate on this legislation for Senator Bourne, who is engaged elsewhere. I will pick up a couple of points which Senator Margetts has just made. What we are dealing with here is part of the costs of growth and part of the costs of the continual expansion of our economic system. We are wanting our population to grow and the number of tourists coming into this country to grow, but what we are seeing here is the downside of that pressure for growth. We are also seeing that the costs of that downside are unequally shared. Those in the more distant areas reap the benefits from increased tourism and those immediately under the flight path are those who bear an unequalled share of the costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point which I think should be stressed&mdash;and Senator Margetts mentioned it earlier&mdash;is that in this bill we see the application of a principle which should be applied more generally. They are the factors which economists call the externalities&mdash;that is, the real costs which do not appear in the bottom line of the program which is causing those costs to be generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those costs do not appear in that bottom line. Those costs are not borne by the beneficiaries of the process, the factory or whatever but they are borne elsewhere in the economy. Those real costs are borne elsewhere. They are called externalities which need to be internalised, which is the proper economic system. Clearly, that means the application by government of a tax on those operations and the hypothecation of that tax to those who are affected, those who bear the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a point that I have made very often, particularly in relation to sales tax: sales tax should be used as a process by which the externalities are internalised and the proper costs of the product are seen by the consumers. Therefore, rational discussions are made in relation to the consumption of those goods or services and those who are external to the generation of the cost nonetheless bear those costs so those people can be adequately compensated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have one of those rare examples of a situation in which the government has seen that this is a way of internalising, at least partially, those externalities. So those who generate the aircraft noise pay the increased levy and those who suffer the imposition of that noise, those who are under the flight path, can to some extent be compensated. That is a principle that the government is accepting in this legislation. It is a principle that should receive much wider application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could just reflect for a moment on one of the points that was made by Senator Margetts, who was referring to the need to supply forced ventilation to those houses that will be extensively insulated. I was surprised and rather dismayed to hear her say that that type of forced ventilation will mean a replacement of the air inside the house every 30 minutes, and that that will necessarily involve very large energy bills. I will be absolutely dismayed if the government seeks to impose that very simple solution, very unsatisfactory solution, on those people under the flight path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already very effective countercurrent heat exchanger devices which would allow one, say, in winter time to bring fresh air into the house and extract the heat from the warm air going out of the house in a countercurrent heat exchanger so that the heat inside the house was preserved but fresh air was brought in; similarly, in the summer time to maintain the coolness inside the house and exchange that coolness with warm air coming in, nonetheless bringing in fresh air. So if the government has not looked at this&mdash;and I have not been part of the Senate committee looking at it&mdash;I strongly urge it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will not be opposing the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill, which are being debated this afternoon. As has already been noted in the debate on these bill, the purpose of this legislation is to impose a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where a federally funded noise amelioration package is in place and when certain criteria have been met.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the only airport where any sort of noise package is in place is at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport where the new third runway has caused intolerable levels of noise and distress for thousands of residents in noise affected suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in recent months about the reasons why the noise problems at Sydney have caused such distress. I know from my parliamentary colleague Senator Vicki Bourne, as I mentioned on whose behalf I am giving this speech this afternoon, that the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, of which she is a member, has received submissions and heard evidence from some extremely distressed people who have had their lives almost destroyed by the noise from aircraft flying overhead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important point that does need to be made in today's debate is that, in most cases, residents affected by airport noise had absolutely no idea whatsoever that the aircraft noise was going to be such a problem in the areas where they are living. The Australian Democrats believe that the biggest cause for concern here is that the residents of Sydney were not properly informed as to the noise impact arising from the third runway becoming operational. If I could interpolate there, I think there was an enormous degree of misleading information, inadequate collection and wrong interpretation of data, which has led to that imposition of the noise on the people of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that the information provided by the government, and in particular by the CAA, was less than adequate is itself something of a major understatement, as I have just indicated. Such behaviour on behalf of a government agency in the case of the CAA is totally unacceptable. We find it remarkable that the CAA chose to behave in such a manner before and, indeed, since the new runway has been operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one conclusion which can be drawn from all this, it is that the community reaction to the new flight paths was seriously underestimated by the original environmental impact statement on the third runway. Even calling this an EIS is perhaps something of a misnomer. Senators will have noted that we are proposing an additional amendment to the opposition's second reading attachment. I understand, from words recently with Senator Parer, that the opposition is supporting those additional clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems to have been the biggest failure was the absolute deficiency in the use of the Australian noise exposure forecast system, or the ANEF as it is called. The ANEF system did not correctly predict the noise impact, and this point has been emphasised again and again to the select committee. The weakness of the EIS is hardly surprising when one considers just how flawed and biased the process was. You cannot realistically expect the proponent of the project to then turn around and write an objective assessment of the environmental impacts arising from the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that affected residents are upset and angry? Not only were they misinformed and deceived, but their lives have in some cases now been totally ruined by the noise from aircraft flying overhead. They feel they have been betrayed by the government. In fact, an objective assessment would say not only do they feel themselves betrayed by the government but they have been betrayed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, as I mentioned, the Democrats will be moving a second reading amendment at the conclusion of this debate to note the failure of the government's EIS process which, as we noted earlier, is largely responsible for the outright deception the people of Sydney have suffered in this whole sorry mess. Indeed, it is imperative at this time, as we focus on the failure of the EIS to accurately predict noise impact, that the government provides a commitment to the parliament and the residents living in the surrounds of the new Sydney West airport that the same mistakes will not be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS on the Sydney West airport must be a genuine and thorough process, carried out independently and at arms length from the aviation bureaucracy and guaranteed to produce positive outcomes in accurately predicting the impact on the people of western Sydney. This aspect forms the second part of the Democrats's second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this issue blew up in the government's face, Senator Bourne tells me that her office has been flooded with letters and phone calls from people whose lives have been totally ruined by the aircraft noise. I know that other senators and members have had a similar experience. Our amendment today seeks to reflect those concerns of the affected residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of our amendment picks up on the concern which has been voiced only this week and relates to the government's intentions to privatise both Kingsford Smith and the Sydney West airports. Many residents quite rightly fear what is involved in the government's privatisation agenda and have expressed the concern that any moves towards this agenda at that particular time would represent extremely bad timing on the government's part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airport privatisation issue forms an important aspect of the Senate select committee's terms of reference, and the Democrats believe that it would be far more appropriate for the government to await the committee's findings and recommendations in this area before proceeding with any legislation on privatisation. This would certainly go some way in allaying growing community concern about the government's privatisation agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also remain concerned that the measures contained in this legislation will not be sufficient to deal with the ongoing noise problem at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. The reality is that under the measures contained in these bills, thousands of affected residents will not qualify for sound proofing. The criteria under which one qualifies is simply too strict. I think Senator Margetts developed that theme quite well in her speech a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that already the select committee has received submissions and heard from many people who are adversely affected by noise impact but most of them do not qualify for soundproofing. Senator Parer made these same points during his speech in the debate on these bills. It would not be unreasonable to assume that people who have taken the time to make a submission before the committee are themselves a fair representation of the thousands who are currently suffering unreasonable levels of aircraft noise but who will not qualify for the relief measures contained in these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, there is the question of the effectiveness of the soundproofing being provided, doubts about which have already been raised and which suggest the possibility that this will simply not be the nice, easy solution to noise which some people may think is provided for in these bills. For instance, in its submission to the committee the coalition of 12 local councils most affected by aircraft noise showed that areas as widespread as Bundeena and Cronulla in the south to Turramurra, Pymble and Chatswood in the north are currently experiencing aircraft noise levels totally disruptive to ordinary daily living; and yet not one of these suburbs was ever identified as likely to be adversely affected by aircraft noise in the period before the third runway became operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, there is every likelihood that the noise problem in Sydney will get much worse for a great many more people when and if the new control tower becomes fully operational. Once this happens, the CAA will allow a substantial increase in the hourly rate of aircraft movements to more than 80 per hour, whereas I understand that the current level is around 60 aircraft movements per hour. One can only try and imagine how much worse the noise will become when this is allowed to happen, given that the noise in affected suburbs is already at intolerable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also forecast that some areas presently unaffected in Drummoyne, Hunters Hill and Lilyfield will be affected by aircraft noise for the first time, while suburbs already badly affected such as Lane Cove, Balmain, Leichhardt and Erskineville will be subject to louder and more frequent noise levels. All this will only serve to underscore the inadequacy of the insulation and soundproofing eligibility criteria contained in these bills. The Democrats believe that there is an urgent need for legislation to freeze the rate of aircraft movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final point that needs to be made in relation to these bills is that funds raised from the proposed aircraft levy contained in these bills are clearly earmarked for the specific purpose of noise amelioration. The Democrats believe that the government should apply this principle, known as hypothecating, in other similar circumstances so that revenues can be raised for specific purposes rather than ending up in consolidated revenue. That is the point that I stressed right at the beginning. Most operations are accompanied by externalities which impact on people and on the environment. They must be internalised. One way in which the government can do this is to amplify this particular measure into other areas; to raise taxes in one form or another and to hypothecate those taxes in the amelioration of the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will mean, of course, that there will be a greater capacity for funds to be raised for specific projects, such as levies particularly, say, in transport related areas. One which, hopefully, we will be dealing with later in this session is the question of the increased revenue from a tax on various fuels, including diesel fuel and light fuel used by rail. It would be ideal if that were hypothecated to building up the rail system which has been allowed to run down very significantly since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Democrats support the measures contained in this legislation, we doubt that it will be sufficient to deal with the growing noise problem in Sydney. The Democrats' amendment is to be added to the end of Senator Parer's amendment. On behalf of Senator Bourne and the Democrats I now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks about the specifics of the legislation and I also want to take issue with a few of the remarks made by Senator Parer and Senator Macdonald in this debate. Firstly, the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 is a landmark bill. It establishes for the first time in this country a regime whereby the principle that the polluter pays will be applied to ensure that amelioration is provided to communities affected by aircraft noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes the important principle that as airlines and their passengers are the major beneficiaries of an airport's operations they should in turn be required to meet the costs of reducing the more severe impacts on the affected communities in the vicinity of airports. The purposes of the bill are to provide for the imposition of a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where noise amelioration programs are being funded by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, a major program has been commenced in Sydney and the government has already announced its intention to introduce, following detailed scoping studies, similar schemes at Adelaide and Coolangatta airports in the future. In Sydney the program provides for the voluntary acquisition of 113 homes in the 40 ANEF contours and to provide for sound insulation to some 4,300 homes above the 30 ANEF contours and sound insulation of schools, colleges, child-care facilities, hospitals, health-care facilities and churches within the 25 ANEF area. The estimated cost of the Sydney program is some $260 million. The scope of the eligibility for this program is at least equal to and in most respects exceeds that of any other major airport in the world where a noise amelioration program is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point that needs to be recognised is that it is this Labor government that is doing something about the problems of aircraft noise, particularly in the Sydney region. It is a Labor government that is committed to building a new airport at Badgerys's Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in my condolence speech with respect to Fred Daly I referred to the fact that when Fred was the member for Grayndler as far back as 1953 he was raising in this parliament the problem of aircraft noise as it impacted upon the residents of his electorate and of surrounding electorates in the St George, Kogarah, Arncliffe and Rockdale regions. It has only ever been Labor members of this parliament and Labor members of the New South Wales parliament who have expressed real concern about the impact of aircraft noise on the residents of Sydney. One can point to a long line of Labor MPs, be they Leo McLeay, Gary Punch, Jeanette McHugh and the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, who have continually raised concerns about the impact of aircraft noise from Kingsford Smith airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign to have the third runway built at Sydney airport was vigorously supported by members of the Liberal and National parties. This government has had the courage to confront the issue of endeavouring to find a way through the competing interests of the needs of the travelling public who utilise aircraft and the needs of the economic considerations of having an international airport located in or near Sydney. This government is committed to finding a balance between those interests and the interests of the residents who live in close proximity to the airport or underneath the flight path. This government has had the courage to tackle that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened intently to Senator Parer and Senator Sandy Macdonald last night, who are members of the select committee, as they attempted to criticise the federal Labor government on this issue and moved this quite ridiculous and hypocritical amendment seeking to condemn the government with respect to aircraft noise.

Let us look at the statements made by those who were beating the drum most loudly in promotion of the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look firstly to the now Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. What did he say on 21 March 1989 in an interview with Mike Carlton on 2GB? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up under the flight paths in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of that area and I've always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on the local residents. There are a limited number of people who are severely affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of them are only mildly affected and in any event bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any event there are many sections of my electorate in areas like Lane Cove and Hunters Hill that have just as much aircraft noise and are as frequently under flight paths as people living near the airport.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, and others out there saying, `The simple solution to this problem is reopening the east-west runway and dumping more than half of that aircraft noise back on the residents who live under the flight path of the east-west runway'&mdash;residents, of course, who were never cared about by a succession of Liberal governments in either the federal or the state parliament, residents who John Howard himself criticised by saying, `They grossly exaggerate the problem.' So, when it was under the old east-west runway, it was never really a problem; but now somehow it is a problem because the residents of Bennelong have taken up the issue with John Howard and have condemned him for his hypocrisy on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The issue of safety is a very important one. The minister has indicated that, on the basis that the operation of the two parallel runways is a safer operation than returning to the old SIMOPS operations or to the use of the cross runways, the east-west runway will not be reopened. What we find in this debate is a cynical attempt by the opposition to use safety, when it completely contradicts the facts and the propositions that they advanced back when they were so strongly supporting the third runway. Let us look at some of the comments the opposition made about safety when they were arguing that the third runway should be built. In December 1988, John Sharp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is ignoring the safety hazard the present chaotic conditions are presenting.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the government has implemented a situation where it is actually safer to land or to take off from Sydney airport because of the utilisation of the parallel runways, the opposition turn around and say, `Let's ignore all that. Let's ignore those safety concerns that we had back in 1988 and 1989. Let's just reopen the east-west runway.' It is a politically cynical exercise based simply upon the fact that they do not like the residents in Hunters Hill and in Lane Cove complaining to them, because they supported the construction of the third runway. Tim Fischer said in August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity.</PARA>
<PARA>In September 1991, David Jull renewed his call for the third runway project to commence following a near collision involving a Qantas B747 landing at Mascot. That is what the opposition said at the time: `We've got these safety concerns. We've had these near incidents, these near collisions. Let's remove those problems caused by intersecting runways. Let's get this third runway built.' The third runway gets built; the minister brings about a safer operation at Sydney airport; and Senator Parer stands up in this Senate and condemns the government for closing the east-west runway.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The debate on these bills has produced a predictable range of views about the impact of the construction of the parallel runway at Sydney airport. Much of the debate has focused on the decision and rationale to restrict operations on the east-west runway. The closure of the east-west runway, except in adverse weather conditions, was an integral part of the government's decision to construct the parallel runway. The government maintains that parallel runway operations are ultimately the best way of getting high safe movement rates through the airport. There has also been little recognition in the debate about the significant number of people in Sydney who have benefited from restricting the use of the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also point out that the noise management plan is not, as Senator Parer implied, a belated reaction to the problem of aircraft noise in Sydney. The development of the plan was an integral part of the government's decision on the construction of the new runway. The only belated position in all of this, Senator Parer, is your position and that of various opposition spokespersons on this issue over the last five or six years&mdash;as has been so well illustrated by Senator Forshaw. The plan necessarily took some time to complete, so it was not possible to commence an insulation and acquisition program before the runway opened. There are two main reasons for that: the extensive process of consultation that was built into the development of the plan, and the fact that nothing of this kind has ever been attempted in Australia before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer also raised doubts about the final costs of the program. The current estimate of the cost of the program is based on the best information currently available about what is a very large and complex undertaking. It is not valid to compare the current estimate of $260 million with the indicative figures originally contained in the draft noise management plan. Such a comparison fails to recognise the broader scope of the program compared with the draft plan and also the more detailed knowledge of insulation costs that has been gained over the intervening period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the three-year target for completing the residential insulation program represents a challenge. There is clearly a need for industry to gear itself up to undertake the task. The government believes that the target of completing the program within three years is achievable. It will be doing all it can to ensure that the time frame is met. The people in Sydney that are impacted by aircraft noise deserve no less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Parer has flagged, there will doubtless be problems encountered in insulating particular buildings to acceptable internal noise levels. The type of work being undertaken is new to Australia. Much has been learned in the work to date, including the pilot study, which will stand us in good stead in meeting those challenges as they arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to some other matters, Senator MacGibbon suggested that the government should be enforcing the use of quieter aircraft, and in particular that Ansett should be forced to withdraw its B727 and F28 aircraft. The phase-out of these aircraft is in fact already being pursued. The opposition would just say, overnight, `Look; let's get rid of these aeroplanes out of the air; let's just get rid of them'&mdash;regardless of the disruption to the Ansett and Qantas fleet arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with international agreements, existing Chapter 2 aircraft, such as the B727 and the F28, must be withdrawn from use or modified to reduce noise levels by 1 March 2002. It would be a massive commercial cost&mdash;and I do not know what the figures are&mdash;to just say, as the opposition say, `Let's get rid of these planes', regardless of the millions of dollars that have been spent on the aircraft&mdash;`Let's just get rid of them out of the air tomorrow'. What a grossly irresponsible position!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon also mentioned the need for better land use planning around airports. Currently the development of land surrounding airports is largely a matter for state and local government planning processes. The government believes there is a need to seek better outcomes and is working in conjunction with the states towards developing a more integrated planning approach. Transport ministers are due to consider the outcomes of work by officials on this matter later this year. The government is concerned to ensure that the impact of airports on their surrounding communities is minimised and will continue to pursue measures to ensure that this is the case. These bills are part of that. They provide for the first time a mechanism of recovering the costs imposed by aircraft noise from the aircraft that generate the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other matters. Firstly, the government will be opposing amendments (a) and (b) as circulated by Senator Parer, and those to be amended by Senator Bourne containing new (c), (d) and (e).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are debating the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill as a whole, I would like to make a few comments in response to Senator Forshaw and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry). Senator Forshaw talked about hypocrisy. If ever I have heard hypocrisy, I heard it from Senator Forshaw. He got up here and talked about all those good Labor people who oppose the building of what he called the third runway. In fact, it is the half runway. We had two runways before, another runway was built, so we now have one and a half. What an incredible exercise!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw talked about all those people and about how they had gone to the barricades. Do you know what happened? Do you know who made the decision to build it? The government made the decision to build it after saying, for years and years, they would not have a bar of another runway. People bought properties on that basis, and then the government made the decision. Why did they make the decision? They made it because apparently they had some sort of sleazy deal which meant if they built this runway they would shut off what was traditionally the original jet strip at Sydney. Apparently it was done simply to protect electorates. So the decision-making process had nothing to do with safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw talked about safety, as did Senator Sherry. They kept saying that safety was the critical factor. From what I understand, from talking with people who were involved in the CAA in those days, safety was not considered. Senator Forshaw was good at quoting people. On 13 August 1991, in response to a question from Senator Brownhill about the near miss that everyone is aware of that had occurred in Sydney&mdash;and near misses are occurring today, I might say, notwithstanding the new runway configuration&mdash;Senator Bob Collins, who was the then minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts are that simultaneous operations are in operation at many, many major airports around the world. There is absolutely no reason whatever why simultaneous operations, if conducted efficiently and professionally, cannot be used&mdash;as they are used in Adelaide, as well as Sydney&mdash;with perfect safety. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the then minister. No doubt the information had been provided to him&mdash;I am sure he would not have said it off the cuff&mdash;by the then Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw also referred to a dissenting report in 1988 to which I was a party. I totally agree with the words in that report. We talked about the immediate construction of the parallel runway. He quoted me as saying that it was `to halve the number of noise-affected residents'. That is quite correct. It is important to know where the new runway was to be located. It was to be located south of the east-west runway, which is now closed, and east of the main north-south runway, which meant that aircraft in the main would take off or land from the south. This would have taken the pressure not only off the people in the northern parts of Kingsford-Smith Airport but also off the people east and west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to remember is that, when that report was written, there was no indication whatsoever that the east-west would be shut. Senator Collins was one member on that committee, and I can remember very well that all of the evidence given to the committee indicated that that extra runway should be built for two reasons. One was to increase the capacity but the other, more importantly, was to halve the noise problems that already existed in Sydney. Notwithstanding the evidence given to that committee, because it was then policy not to build the darn thing, the Labor Party came out with a majority report saying they should not build it but they should perhaps look at it some time down the track. I made the point when debating that particular report that, in view of the fact that all these people had given evidence in good faith and at great cost to them, the evidence was not taken into account at all when the majority report came down. I recall saying very well that, if that was to occur in the future, these committees would be a waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that has to be made is that, when that recommendation in the minority report came in, the intent was not to close the east-west runway. As has been said by many people, as that committee has not concluded its evidence, I do not think it is proper to pre-empt its findings. But the point has been made over and again by pilots, by air traffic controllers&mdash;people who should know as they are the ones who use the airport&mdash;that the east-west can be opened safely. Whether you use simultaneous operations can be debated, but there is a system called dependent use of crossing runways. It is used in major airports all around the world. I think it is important that this differentiation be made, notwithstanding the remarks by air traffic controllers, the pilots and the Civil Aviation Authority that it is less safe. I do not think anyone would dispute that. But when the question was asked `How less safe?' the answer could not be given. Someone said to me that it was very similar to using crossroads with lights or a roundabout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that I put that on the record because Senator Forshaw had the gall to come in here and talk about hypocrisy. If ever there was hypocrisy, it is from Labor people who are saying, `Look at me, aren't I pure? I objected.' Who made the decision to go ahead and do it? It was the Labor Party. </PARA>

As Senator Bourne would recall, that has been said to us over and again, and it has come from a whole range of people. It has come from people in suburbs that the Labor Party would call their Labor heartland&mdash;Leichhardt/Marrickville. People feel that they have been abused by the government on this issue. It comes from people who had no indication of this whatsoever, hence our agreement to support the Democrat amendment and their supporting of our amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to make some comments on and ask some questions about the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995. The opening of the third runway, as Senator Parer said, basically concluded that Sydney would have 1 1/2 runways when it was promised three. It has 1 1/2 runways when it was promised three because the new parallel runway is used only for landings from the north and landings from the south but take-offs to the south were prohibited and the east-west runway was closed. The east-west runway was closed solely because of politics, not because of safety. As Senator Parer said, originally when the decision to build the third runway was taken, we have it on very good authority that safety was not even considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to the decision to embark on noise insulation. We are told that noise insulation is provided for houses over 30 ANEF&mdash;which is the Australian noise enforcement forecast&mdash;and schools and similar buildings, such as nursing homes and hospitals, over 25 ANEF. But there has been no undertaking to insulate public buildings. There are a number of public buildings in the flight path, including the Marrickville town hall, where we took evidence. I would like to know why that decision was not taken and why it would not be appropriate to provide some insulation to those public buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that the ANEF contours have absolute suspect credibility. The whole EIS process was suspect. The ANEF method of determination of noise seems to be totally inappropriate. I understand that it is based on the logarithmic table, and it takes a completely inappropriate view. Apparently, if you have an area that is subject to 20 ANEF and you double the traffic, it is possible that the ANEF might only go to 23, which seems an extraordinarily unfair real approach to the impact of aircraft noise. To be fair the government must have a very close look at the way the ANEF contours work, the areas covered and the credibility of that assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know whether the government proposes to provide compensation or to review its noise insulation program for those houses that are presently outside the ANEF guidelines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate you have impaired comprehension, Senator Sherry, but I did not say in the debate that I was going to sell all the aircraft that were operating into Sydney airport. What I did say&mdash;and I will say it in as close to monosyllabic words as possible so you can follow it&mdash;was that the oldest aircraft were the noisiest. They were the Boeing 727s and the Fokker F28s. I said they were almost totally written off against the books of the company that was operating them and I was surprised that the government did not suggest to the company that they conform to the accepted noise standards for aircraft operating in RPT services. It was really a gross misrepresentation to claim that I said anything to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that you, Senator, implied that I did not realise that land planning around airports was a matter for the state government and local councils. I understand that very well, but I also understand the power of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is inter alia&mdash;through the FAC&mdash;the owner of those airports. If there is vacant land on the approach paths and that is in the beady eyes of the Labor council of Brisbane to be converted into a high density residential area, presumably with housing commission houses where they can put a few more Labor voters in&mdash;although it would not help them much because it is a Labor area&mdash;then it would have been possible for the Commonwealth government, if it had any intelligence and foresight, to have gently suggested to the Brisbane City Council and the state government that there were better places to build houses than on the old Cannon Hill saleyards.

We have taken the position that we would act on those recommendations. However, the minister has said a further study will be conducted after three years with respect to residences below the 30 ANEF contour to further assess the application.

<PARA>I will briefly explain what they are about. This is actually removing the section that tightens further the requirements for people who wish to apply for a disability support pension. However, I want to make some comments about consultation before I go into some details on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I believe the government does not really understand what these amendments are going to do in the longer term, because they have not really consulted in this area. Indeed, until we got to the point of working through the committee process, I had great difficulty finding anybody with whom they have spent a lot of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I wrote to the Head Injury Council of Australia earlier this year, the executive director replied thanking me for drawing the legislation to his attention and telling me that the council had not been consulted by the government. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council is partly funded by the Commonwealth and it is surprising and disappointing that the Department of Social Security did not seek our views and those of related disability organisations on the process of drafting this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats believe that thanks to the Senate committee process the committee now has considerable compelling evidence that these amendments should not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wide range of organisations representing people from various organisations who support those with disabilities have written to us and have given evidence before the Senate committee about what I believe will be significantly harmful effects of these amendments. They have all told us the same thing: the DSP assessment is already too rigid and inflexible and that what we are doing by further narrowing the eligibility criteria is likely to severely disadvantage a group of already disadvantaged individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the government is trying to stop a handful of people. I understand&mdash;and the minister may be able to correct me on this&mdash;that we are only talking about 40 people who have succeeded through the appeal process, who have had the decisions of the department overturned and who are now in receipt of the DSP which they were previously refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a fairly narrow number of people that this bill is supposed to be targeting; but it has opened up the possibility of indeed restricting access for many other people who, until now, have successfully got the DSP. As we heard through the committee process, it is far better for people to be on the DSP if they are really looking at employment than to have to go through and be on the treadmill of jobsearch and newstart, which many of them simply do not make. In the longer term, we are simply lengthening the queues of those who are already looking for assistance through the Salvation Army, the various Lifeline services and central missions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the coalition's guidelines, which I understand Senator Patterson will be speaking about in a moment, to  schedule 4 of the bill, I acknowledge that this is a small improvement; it is a step in the right direction. However, I believe that they are far too narrow. Some groups that we have spoken to are under the misapprehension that these guidelines are going through in the process of amendments, that we are proceeding with amendments which, unfortunately, we are not; we are simply looking at some guidelines. I believe that they do not overcome the basic problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrat amendments are opposed by the government for the following reasons: the schedule 4 amendments restate government policy, which is that non-medical factors should not be taken into account in disability support pension decision making. This is reflected in the May 1991 second reading speech introducing the disability service pension which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key aspect of the disability support pension is that the inability to work as defined in this bill must stem completely, or virtually completely from the person's impairment. Non-medical factors will not be considered in the process of assessing a person's inability to work, except that for people aged 55 or over consideration will be given to the connection between their age and the likelihood of their finding work in the local labour market.</PARA>

There are other more appropriate income support payments for persons whose inability to work does not stem solely from their medical condition or illness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many AAT or SSAT decisions are we talking about? I draw the minister's attention to the fact that there is quite a fine line between what we mean by medical and non-medical.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson's guidelines touch on that area, but by no means cover all of those aspects. So we are forcing people back onto the jobsearch-newstart treadmill of having to prove constantly that they are not wanted, that they are failing in the process, and not giving them the access they have under the DSP to many of the opportunities to engage in employment programs and training opportunities because they are second in the queue&mdash;the people with the DSP get the targeted programs, as we heard in the committee process. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The annual report for 1993-94 of the Housing Assistance Act is a formal requirement. The data in this report is very significant and most important. Of course, it focuses on the Commonwealth-state housing authorities and the various agreements. It is crucial to the planning needs of public housing throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that it acknowledges many of the issues surrounding the private rental market forces and those that impact on the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. It acknowledges that over 10,000 households were assisted into home ownership and 55,000-odd households were newly housed in public housing. All those issues are most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the report also deals with the block assistance to the states for public housing, pensioner rental housing, Aboriginal rental housing, community housing, mortgage and rent relief, crisis accommodation and all the various aspects of both capital costs and policy that demand attention in this very important area. There is particularly a need for consistency in policy between market rents and public housing rent rebates, et cetera, for tenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in particular that over the last decade there have been steady increases in the number of people on public housing waiting lists throughout Australia. In fact, this report acknowledges that the waiting list at 30 June 1994 was  235,372 families in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn, obviously, to one of those issues, which was addressed in a question on notice in this Senate yesterday by Senator Paul Calvert and the alarming answer that was given by Senator Bob Collins. This related to the provision of a $425,000 house, built at taxpayers' expense, for an elected ATSIC commissioner, which has just come to light in this question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This house on Thursday Island, complete with carpets, white goods and bedding, would be let to the Torres Strait Islander zone commissioner for $125.25 per week. This surely draws us into an issue of Third World images relating to Aboriginal housing that must be contrasted and looked at. It is an insult to public housing tenants throughout Australia and the more than 235,000 families that I have just alluded to that are on public housing waiting lists. The rent bears no relationship to either the ATSIC commissioner's salary, which is $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 per year, or accepted public housing rent formulas that are alluded to in this report being considered today under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw your attention to those various programs that impact on so many people. I mentioned them earlier. There are the assistance programs for capital building, pensioner rental housing, Aboriginal rental housing, community housing, mortgage and rent relief and crisis accommodation. The report we are considering acknowledges that 21 per cent of indigenous families are in homeless or overcrowded circumstances compared with 3.6 per cent of non-indigenous families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also states that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are recognised as the most disadvantaged population group in terms of their access to suitable housing. Suitable housing! An amount of $425,000 is going towards one house, which chews up the equivalent of one-fiftieth of the total Commonwealth allocation for Aboriginal housing programs throughout Australia. ATSIC has a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question needs to be asked: what are the government priorities? Are they ignoring the compelling need of Aboriginals throughout Australia? Obviously, if you are a mate of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), different rules apply. The question that was very properly asked by Senator Calvert and answered in such an alarming manner yesterday by Senator Bob Collins now deserves some very close attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many houses for Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders could be built, by the normal cost averaging factor, for $425,000? The point that is alluded to in the report is that the estimate is considered typical of construction costs on Thursday Island. What are they building? A new Government House for the Torres Strait? I consider this to be a very gross dereliction of duty on behalf of the minister, ATSIC and the Torres Strait Islanders. It must demand close attention. </PARA>

The first relates to the difficulties the Australian government and the Australian people are having with the French government. I simply put on the record that I for one regret the fact that the proper concern that so many Australians have, and that I share, about the resumption of nuclear testing in the Pacific by the French government has led to some instances of racist anti-French behaviour. This behaviour clearly breaches traditional Australian fair go principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, it unfairly blames the French people for the actions of the French government. I am certain that, in the light of a more considered position, which I hope most Australians adopt, people will withdraw from those aggressive and effectively racist views and the sort of mob attitudes which have, frankly, diminished our standing as a place where a fair go is regarded so highly. I for one welcome the return of the French ambassador to Australia in the week before last, after having been recalled to France, so that proper diplomatic dialogue can proceed between the Australian government and the French government on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I now want to deal with the latest instalment in the saga of the Keating piggery. A press release has been issued that is headed `DanPork Australia Restructures'. I will read this press release quickly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DanPork Australia Joint Venture has undergone a restructure.</PARA>
<PARA>We remember that that is the joint venture in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was involved as a half owner of the Euphron group of piggery companies, which included the Brown and Hatton piggeries. It was formerly owned by the `Minister for Having a Good Time', Mr John Brown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other half of that joint venture was a Danish company, Danpork. This Danpork joint venture was to be partly Australian and partly Danish. As a result of what has happened, it is now, apparently, entirely to be foreign owned. Mr Keating has sold out to foreigners at a very substantial profit. As a result, FIRB, or Foreign Investment Review Board, approval has been required for changes. The only thing we do not know, and no mention has been made of this, is whether Mr Keating still has access to the repurchase&mdash;I stress that word&mdash;option that was outlined in the draft memorandum of understanding that was drawn up three days before Mr Keating sold his shares. I will quickly read the rest of this press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DanPork Australia Joint Venture has undergone a restructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreement was reached on 11 August 1995 for Al Constantinidis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that he was Mr Keating's piggery partner and was responsible for the continual breaches of almost every law in the book relating to companies while he was acting on Mr Keating's behalf; at no stage did Mr Keating feel the necessity to publicly dissociate himself from or criticise in any way the actions of Mr Constantinidis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and his family companies to sell their interests in Euphron Pty Limited and Elenium Pty Limited to a consortium of investors based in Singapore which are sympathetic to the Soeryadjaya family and JGL Pte Limited. The sale is subject to FIRB approval.</PARA>
<PARA>JGL is controlled by the Soeryadjaya family. JGL is registered in Singapore and has its directors in Hong Kong. This is the company to which Mr Keating's interest was sold in March last year. The press release goes on:</PARA>

The person in that repurchase option was to be nominated by Mr Constantinidis, Mr Keating's piggery partner, or Mr Coudounaris, Mr Keating's solicitor who also happens to be the secretary to his family company.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on an environmental matter, namely the protection of the head waters of the Great Australian Bight, which has proved to be a very important breeding ground for the southern right whale. I do this because a great deal of concern has been expressed in South Australia in relation to a study which has been carried out jointly for both the Commonwealth and the state in relation to the designation of a marine park in that region. The reason for the joint study is that the three-mile limit comes under the state government's jurisdiction and the waters beyond that come under the Commonwealth's jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report which has resulted from that study, which was jointly commissioned by both the Commonwealth and the state, is now being held by the state and not being released for public comment. It is not even being released, as I understand it, to the Commonwealth which was one of those requesting this report. So we have a situation where South Australia has, compared with the other states, very little of its waters designated as marine parks and the South Australian government appears to be resisting very vigorously and by rather dubious means the designation of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of amplification let me say that Australia's marine environments are both diverse and unique, particularly in the southern temperate cold water regions. It is not generally recognised that the biodiversity in the colder parts of Australia is similar to or exceeds the biodiversity in the tropical areas. In the southern cooler temperate regions, a long period of geological isolation and a long east-west southern coastline have resulted in unparalleled diversity in many plant and animal groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the southern waters of Australia have some of the highest levels of diversity for marine plants and invertebrates&mdash;that is, ascidians, bryozoans and crustaceans&mdash;in the world. These conditions have also resulted in many of these plants and animals being found nowhere else in the world. For instance, approximately 90 per cent of all fish, mollusc and echinoderms found in these cooler waters are found nowhere else in the world. In contrast, only 10 per cent of the tropical fauna is unique to the northern tropical regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The temperate southern regions of Australia are particularly poorly protected. Despite the very high levels of biodiversity, with many species found nowhere else in the world, more than 90 per cent of the area of Australia's marine parks is located in the tropical regions of Australia protecting tropical marine habitats. Approximately 88 per cent of the total area of marine parks in Australia comprises one marine park alone&mdash;that is, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Unfortunately, the marine habitats of the southern cooler regions of Australia are also under the greatest threat from human activities. It is the southern regions in which 75 per cent of Australia's population lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Australian Bight Marine Park would be the first multiple-use marine park in the entire Greater Australian Bight region protecting the representative flora, fauna, habitats and ecosystems of the Great Australian Bight. To date, over 90 per cent of the present marine protected areas is in the tropical, relatively uninhabited regions of Australia. However, some of the highest levels of biodiversity and endemism occur in our temperate regions&mdash;they are also under the greatest pressure, as I indicated a moment ago, from human impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marine parks are a nationally and internationally recognised tool for the integrated management of marine ecosystems, while conserving areas of key significance&mdash;that is, the Great Barrier Reef, Shark Bay, Ningaloo, et cetera. In all these parks only a small proportion, some five per cent to 10 per cent, is excluded from extractive or exploitative activities. The point I am stressing here is that these are multi-use areas which are designed to protect an overall area but within that to completely protect a small proportion, five per cent to 10 per cent, from those extractive or exploitative activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marine parks are also wonderful ecotourism opportunities, as witnessed by the national and international profile of the reserves of the Great Barrier Reef, Shark Bay and Ningaloo. As such, the Great Australian Bight Marine Park has the potential to be a major national and international tourist drawcard for Australia, particularly for the remote west coast communities of South Australia. Indeed, during the present winter, very large numbers of people are visiting that area for whale watching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia is the only state in Australia not to declare any marine parks. Even many developing nations have marine parks, for instance Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. South Australia presently has the least proportional area of its jurisdictional waters protected under habitat conservation and management legislation. There is only 1.4 per cent in South Australia compared with 25 per cent and 20 per cent respectively in Queensland and Western Australia. The Western Australian government has recently released a report, the Wilson report, recommending a further 77 marine parks for its coastline. This is because of the demonstrated economic benefits, particularly ecotourism, of marine parks like Ningaloo and Shark Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Australian Bight Marine Park will protect one of the most critical nursery, calving and breeding areas of the endangered southern right whale in the world. It is also the most important site for carving and breeding in Australia&mdash;over half of all the calves born in Australian waters are born at this one site. This species is considered both threatened and vulnerable to extinction. The Great Australian Bight Marine Park is essentially multiple-use, managing a range of uses&mdash;that is, fishing, tourism, recreation, mining and conservation&mdash;on an integrated ecosystem basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The buffer zone proposed for the Great Australian Bight Marine Park is the conservation zone. Importantly, the proposed conservation zone will protect the activities of fishing and mining from detrimentally affecting the whales. Of particular concern is the potential for acoustic disturbance from boats and mineral exploration activities to cause disturbance to calving mothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extensive research both here in Australia and overseas indicates that whales are affected by acoustic disturbance from boats from 27 kilometres away. That is an enormous distance and indicates the sensitivity of whales, particularly during this critical time of calving. The whales at the Head of Bight are calving mothers. The potential disturbance from adjacent boats can cause mothers to desert their calves and leave them prone to malnourishment and predation from white sharks. This has been identified as one of the major threats to the southern right whale and humpback whale populations in the Commonwealth's national cetacean action plan of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A proposed sanctuary&mdash;that is, the smaller area for complete protection&mdash;at the Head of Bight is not sufficient to protect the whales from acoustic disturbance. That is the alternative proposal being put by the South Australian government. That lesser proposal is being strongly promoted by some fishing interests and evidently also by the government of South Australia. Also the proposed Head of Bight sanctuary&mdash;that is, the smaller area proposed by the South Australian government&mdash;fails to protect the other critical breeding area at the Merdayerrah Sandpatch and also the migratory route between the two identified breeding areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget the 21 breeding colonies of the rare Australian sea lions. These represent approximately 10 per cent of the world population and represent the most significant populations for this species in the world. This is because these species were never commercially harvested and hence are thought to have very high levels of genetic diversity, which is very important in the recovery of threatened or rare species.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth of Australia has national and global responsibilities for protecting biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable use of resources, and also protecting rare and endangered marine mammals such as the endangered southern right whale and the rare Australian sea lion&mdash;that is, threatened species legislation and the national cetacean action plan, and the national seal action plan being drawn up by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Research and development programs are not the primary role of the Environment Protection Agency. Urban stormwater is principally a State, Territory and Local Government responsibility in which the Commonwealth is limited in its capacity to be involved. Research work is being done through research organisations such as universities, CSIRO jointly with the Co-operative Research Centre for Waste Management and Pollution Control, and the Cooperative Research Centre for Fresh Water Ecology. The research has been looking into the mechanisms of water quality improvements that occur in wetland and retardation basins including:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of wetland research is demonstrated by the timely Conference on Wetlands for Water Quality Control at the James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland in September.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The operation and control of stormwater and sewage networks in our cities is the responsibility of local government authorities, urban sewage and water authorities in the State and Territories under various administrative arrangements established by State and Territory Governments. The Urban Water Research Association of Australia, a part of the Water Services Association of Australia, is supported by the urban water authorities to conduct industry funded research into water issues for both metropolitan and non-metropolitan urban areas in Australia.

Expenditure for this project over two years is estimated to be $388 000. While good contacts have been established by CSIRO with both the Sydney and Melbourne Water Corporations, to attract interest in this work, a number of impediments to large scale implementation of this technology have been identified:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. The EPA prepared a discussion paper `Urban Stormwater, a resource too valuable to waste' based on the CSIRO report. Many of the 23 recommendations of the CSIRO report appear as general policy statements or areas of concern requiring further action at the local level. The discussion paper was designed to raise these issues with the broader community so they can help local governments to deal with these issues and work through potential solutions. The EPA also produced a Facts Sheet on Urban Stormwater as a means of raising the awareness of the community of the importance of this resource. The Facts Sheet suggests ways people may assist in reducing pollutant loads into the stormwater system.</PARA>
