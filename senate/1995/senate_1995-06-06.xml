<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's infamous promise before the 1993 election `not to put up tax', which was later redefined to mean not to put up the tax burden as a proportion of GDP. In the light of this, I refer the minister to this year's budget which reveals that taxation to GDP has risen from 22.1 per cent in 1992-93, the year in which the Prime Minister made that infamous promise, to a forecast 24.2 per cent in 1995-96. I ask: does the minister agree that this 2.1 per cent of GDP&mdash;over $10,000 million&mdash;increase in the burden of taxation represents the value of Prime Minister Keating's electoral tax fraud and deceit?</PARA></TALK.START>

There are more competent authorities in this chamber than I am. However, having disposed of that, it is a question of Senate craft on your part, Senator: you actually ought to learn how this chamber runs. But that is an aside point. Let me go to your actual question. As I understand what the Prime Minister said, and it has been reiterated in this chamber numerous times by my colleague the Leader of the Government here, Senator Gareth Evans, we are within the range that the Prime Minister referred to when he made that undertaking. So no promise has been broken. As much as you would like to pretend it has been, no promise&mdash;and I repeat: no promise&mdash;has been broken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Evans's concern. Allowing this crowd to deal with industrial relations is like giving a child a box of matches, and it is causing very serious concern. There is a very immediate concern about what it is doing to the trade performance directly, and there is a very immediate concern about those Australian businesses whose particular trading relationships have been affected. The concern I particularly want to refer to is the damage it has the potential to do to our overall international reputation as a reliable and efficient international trader. In international affairs and in trade, as in other matters, images are quick to form and slow to change. The decade and more that we have had of record industrial peace in this country is slowly starting to impact on the perception of international business about Australia's industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>

Thank you for the interjection. The level of industrial relations is now at about one-third of the level of lost time that it was under the opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; it is very slow to change. Those dangerous industrial pyromaniacs over there could put it all in jeopardy, just as the Western Australians are. The positive results of all this work can be very easily damaged. It only takes one set of provocative actions, like those of the Western Australian government, to put at risk that very long, slow process of changing the entrenched image of Australia. A lot of hard work and a lot of cooperation mean that industrial disputes are now 65 per cent lower than when the opposition was running industrial relations. It is a very serious cause of concern to everybody who wants Australia's international trading performance to improve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spent a lot of money trying to change Australia's image, trying to lift the perception in the public eye of Australia as a reliable trading partner for commodities and, in particular, for manufactures and services. All the work that this government has done, not by itself but with the trade union movement, with business and with most of the state governments has helped to turn this image around. It has meant that eventually the reality of the low level of industrial disputes in Australia is starting to impinge on the consciousness of business internationally. It will be a terrible tragedy if the ideological blinkers of the Western Australian government and its commitment to seek to destroy the trade unions and the wage standards of Australian workers put all this at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have strong views about the industrial dispute, I am not talking about its merits. I am talking about the provocative actions of the Western Australian government and the need for it to put aside its ideological blinkers, think about the national interest and not destroy the hard work that the government, other state governments, businesses and trade unions have put in place to bring about this remarkable transformation in our industrial relations, which has been of great assistance to our international image and our marketing performance abroad. I urge the Western Australian government to reconsider and not continue with this provocative course of action.</PARA>

During question time on 29 May 1995 a gaggle of government ministers, including yourself, repeatedly claimed that the impact of your sales tax slug on building materials would increase the cost of an average home by around $400. Why, then, Minister, did Senator Schacht state in the Senate during a personal explanation on 30 May that he told small business people in Townsville that `the increase in wholesale sales tax would increase the cost for a more average house of up to $1,000?' Didn't Senator Schacht let the cat out of the bag and simply confirm that the HIA and the MBA were right in their predictions of the impact of this tax on Australian homes?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is completely out of order for him to turn around and attack the integrity of one of his Senate colleagues.

It is not possible to give a precise estimate about the size of the impact because it depends on the type of house and the relevant fittings in the house. For a median new house costing $155,000&mdash;that is a house and land package&mdash;the impact may be around $500 to $800.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say at the outset that in my 17 years in this parliament I have never seen worse abuses of parliamentary privilege than those perpetrated by the member for Deakin yesterday. I also say at the outset that I do warmly welcome the statements that were made this morning by Mr Downer in respect of the allegations against the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its officers and by Mr Howard in relation to the allegation specifically against Mr Leibler, in both cases regretting Mr Aldred's behaviour and dissociating themselves and the party from that. I think that was an appropriate response and I am grateful for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as Mr Costello is concerned, let me state for the parliamentary record what I have already said publicly. I accept absolutely Mr Costello's statement to me that there is not a shred of truth to these allegations. Michael Costello is one of Australia's finest public servants, with an outstanding public reputation. I have the utmost confidence in him and no intention whatever of standing him down, as I was urged to do by Mr Aldred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Mr Costello and Mr Leibler, who has also been grossly and irresponsibly defamed, I welcome a full and rigorous examination of these matters by the Australian Federal Police working with their international colleagues. I have no doubt that this inquiry will establish that the allegations are utterly without foundation and will as well also help to expose something of the motivations of those responsible for producing this material in the first place and putting it on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the alleged paedophile activities are concerned, let me confirm some of the basic points that were put on the record by Mr Bilney in the other place last night. First, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not, does not and will not ever condone paedophile activities by any of its officers. Secondly, when some allegations were drawn to attention in the past, in 1988 and 1993, they were the subject of full investigation by the Australian Federal Police and were found not to be substantiated. When allegations were made again in April this year, the AFP responded to our request for advice and for investigative action as appropriate, but there was no new information warranting an investigation. If new allegations are made with sufficient precision by Mr Aldred or anyone else to enable them to be investigated, then of course we would want that to happen. If Mr Aldred has any specific evidence, he should hand it over immediately to the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also make it clear that my department has not let matters rest there. It may possibly be that, irrespective of whether criminal activity is involved, conduct may have occurred which should properly be subject to Public Service disciplinary proceedings. The department has, accordingly, some weeks ago, set in train an internal investigation, which is still under way, to consider those questions. Mr Costello has himself put out a much more detailed statement on all of this today, and I seek leave to incorporate the text of that in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE ON PAEDOPHILE ACTIVITY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a statement to the Parliament yesterday, Mr Aldred MP, raised a number of allegations of alleged paedophile activity in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. One specific allegation he makes is that I, as Secretary of the Department, did not veto the promotion of an officer to a senior position in the Department even though I was allegedly aware of that of officer's paedophile proclivities. That allegation by Mr Aldred is a foul, loathsome, cowardly lie.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aldred also alleged in Parliament yesterday that the senior management of DFAT, not only tolerates known paedophiles in the Department but actively promotes them. That is also a foul, baseless lie.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aldred goes on to say that there are approximately 20 senior executive service officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who engage in paedophile activities within Australia and overseas. He refers specifically to Mr John Holloway by name and identifies another serving DFAT officer by reference to his current position. Similar allegations were reported in the Australian media sourced to a Philippines anti-paedophile activist some months ago. The Department immediately wrote to the Attorney-General's Department and to the Federal Police to ask them to investigate the matter of these allegations involving these two officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has received advice from both the Federal Police and from the Attorney-General's Department that following their enquiries there is no evidence to support any allegations of involvement of either of these officers in paedophile activities. To be absolutely sure, however, I instructed our Embassy in Manila to pursue with the source of the Philippines allegations whether there was any concrete evidence that would support action against those officers under the Public Service Act, as distinct from the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Embassy in Manila has now reported to me that Embassy officers there have had discussions (in the company of officers of the Child Welfare Department) with Dr Zaide the source of the earlier allegations. Dr Zaide, after a long discussion, acknowledged that she was unable to provide any specific evidence or substantiation of allegations that Australian diplomats had been involved in paedophile activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aldred also refers to a former DFAT officer currently working in Hanoi. That officer has not been a member of this Department for a decade. Any questions, therefore, relating to him should be addressed elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Aldred also specifies a former Australian Ambassador stationed in Hanoi in the late 1980s. He also, without specifying names or current positions, levels the accusation of paedophile behaviour against another 15 or so officers of the Department. In all these cases he should give all details in his possession to the Australian Federal Police as a matter of urgency. He should supply all names, evidence and data in his possession. This Department will cooperate to the absolute maximum extent possible in the investigation of any such allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reject utterly the suggestion by Mr Aldred that the Department is obstructing or attempting to prevent examination of any matters in this regard. We are, and we will continue to take the initiative in examining such matters and ensuring that the police and any other relevant body are involved in a full and complete investigation.</PARA>

Minister, yesterday you told the Senate that it is the government's desire to make the banking industry more competitive. I remind you of the current situation: the four big banks already control 65 per cent of total assets; banks enjoy margins nearly twice the average of other industrialised countries; and, as we established yesterday, they are not passing on to consumers the one per cent fall in wholesale interest rates. Add to that the fact that the four big banks are starting as favourites to take over Bank WA and the Bank of Melbourne. Do you agree that such a further concentration in the banking markets in Western Australia and Victoria actually limits the opportunity to deliver further competition and the lower interest rates you talked about yesterday? In reality, hasn't the trend since deregulation been towards fewer, bigger banks? And how does this really help deliver those customer services and interest rates that you talked about?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just note that as a sign of a competitive market. The other point that I think is necessary to be made here is that the finance market is wider than just the banks. While you do make the point about the four majors, what we are seeing is a degree of consolidation of the regional banks. When we see regional banks like the Advance Bank and the Bank of South Australia coming together, we have an entity better able to provide greater competition to the four majors. I think that is a sign of more effective competition in the banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I make about this is market entry. This is a complex and difficult field to enter, but there are no restrictions on market entry for real competition here and that adds to the wider competitive nature of the financial market. This is a dynamic market. Mergers show that it is dynamic and there are still a number of players which do provide competition between one another. Yesterday I referred to Aussie Home Loans and the AMP Society deciding to extend its operations into home mortgages. They are signs of greater competition. That competition is not just in terms of the headline rate for interest being charged on particular things, but also competition between banking products and the diversity of detail and products offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One always wants to see greater competition. It is the government's desire to have a competitive domestic economy. We believe that by doing that we will be able to be more effective, become stronger and become more internationally competitive. But I think we would have to say that, if this question swings on whether some regional banks will consolidate, then the bottom line is that out of that the new entities created will provide far better competition to the big four than they would if they remained separate and regional.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to tell the Senate about the rural women's forum, which is being held in Parliament House over the next two days. The forum has been initiated by the Centre for Rural Social Research at the Charles Sturt University and it brings together women from around Australia. Importantly, financial support has been provided by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Office of the Status of Women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 70 women are attending the forum, including representatives from rural women's groups and governments, journalists, and so on. The main theme is the status of rural women and the needs of all women in rural communities. A particular focus will be on issues affecting women in agriculture. It is believed that there is something like 80,000 women in Australia working as farmers or farm managers, and some further 13,000 working as farm hands and assistants. In broad terms, women represent about 30 per cent of the agricultural work force in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise the value of off farm work done by women in rural Australia. Certainly, one of the challenges rural women face is the changing perception of their work and what they do. I quote Mary Salce from Victoria at last year's International Women in Agriculture Conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's the community perception of farm women? They've assumed we're in the kitchen cooking jams and making feather light scones, looking out our country windows at the beauty of the countryside, but in reality we're up to our knees in mud, pulling calves or sitting for days in a sweltering tractor cab harvesting our crops, as well as raising our families.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that some of the people opposite, particularly my colleague Senator Boswell, would know that these are very real descriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take up these issues tonight when I address the annual general meeting of Women in Agriculture. I will also be discussing with the group a report by Cathy McGowan, funded by the federal government, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Kids&mdash;Who Cares?&mdash;Child Care&mdash;A Work-Related Issue for Farm Families</EMPHASIS>. This report highlights the challenges faced by farming women in their dual roles as partners and mothers. They are worried about the safety and wellbeing of their children, particularly when those children are growing up on farms with animals, machines and chemicals, where all of those pose particular dangers to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure if the Senate is aware of just how dangerous it is to be a child in rural Australia because there is a number of special challenges faced by those families and a number of deaths of children in farming communities due to accidents on farms, to the point where Worksafe Australia has had a specific and particular focus on occupational health and safety for farm families. It is a major concern and it is one of the reasons child care is such an issue of importance for rural families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry by Cathy McGowan particularly addressed assistance for rural families. I am pleased to say that now that Victoria has signed the national child-care strategy, innovative places for rural areas may be available. I am looking at ways, and we are already working with the Victorian government, of finding a solution to address the pilot program as proposed by Cathy McGowan's paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I might also mention briefly some of the other things we provide for families in rural Australia: mobile children's services, multi-function children's services and, in particular, the recently announced 100 places in all family day care schemes which may be accessed by seasonal workers in rural and remote Queensland. That is already available in Shepparton and other parts of Victoria. Again, it is a very important area of concern for rural families who depend on seasonal work. We are as concerned to assist rural families with child care as we are urban families. We appreciate that child care has to be flexible to meet the different needs of rural families. That is the sort of thing I will be talking about at the conference tonight.</PARA>

At that time the guidelines had not yet been tabled, which is why there is reference in that document to the fact that they had no effect in law. The Government Solicitor had been informed&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill has asked me to explain the morality of including the oversight in a notice of appeal. I am happy to do just that. Our legal advice is that, having become aware of the administrative oversight and its impact on the guidelines, it would have been improper not to include it in the notice of appeal. The only allowable means for informing the Federal Court is via the grounds of appeal section of a notice of appeal. I have been informed that there is no other way to do this and that to not do so would constitute unethical behaviour and fraud on the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the suggestion that the administrative oversight is being used as a basis of appeal against a private sector litigant, this is a wrong accusation. The appeal in question relates only to the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; it is not an appeal on the merits against a decision in favour of a private sector litigant. The administrative oversight is included in the grounds of appeal for those sound ethical reasons. I table the documents I have referred to.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 5 June 1995 you sought advice from me as to why the Department included as a Ground of Appeal in Federal Court Proceeding NG289 of 1995 that:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have sought advice (Attachment B) from the responsible officer within the Department who was handling this matter and he in turn sought advice (Attachment A) from the Australian Government Solicitor who was engaged in representing the Department.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also confirm that you had not been advised of this particular of the Grounds of Appeal until today. Indeed, a Minute to you of 2 May 1995 on this matter which sought your approval to proceed with an appeal against the ruling of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not indicate that the invalidity of the Guidelines would be a Ground of Appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also wish to advise you that procedures are now in place which require that any actions or decisions in respect of legislative proceedings in connection with the IR&amp;D Act 1986 or of any legal proceedings related to that Act require my approval prior to proceedings or in the event of my absence, the General Manager of the Tax Concession Branch of AusIndustry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill on 5 June 1995, relating to the failure to table research and development finance scheme guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>I only need a couple of minutes. I want to point out how astonishing the explanation is that Minister Cook has just given. He has sought to plead his own default as a basis upon which the court should find in his favour. That is what he has done in this instance. It is really quite amazing. He came in today and argued that it would be unethical not to do so, unethical not to plead his own default as a ground for which he should win the case. Have you ever heard such an amazing argument!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in this instance was that the taxpayer bought an action before the AAT and the AAT made a decision, based on the guidelines under the R&amp;D tax concession provisions, against the government. The decision was made against the government. The government then became aware, in fact, that the guidelines were invalid because it, the government, the  minister's department, the minister responsible, had failed to table the guidelines. So it went back to the court on appeal and said that now the government should be successful because there are no guidelines in force and the court should therefore find against the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister said today is, `I really had no choice but to do that. This was the interim period between my becoming aware of my default and seeking to take action to overcome that default. Therefore I acknowledge that in that period'&mdash;apparently for the first time today&mdash;`the guidelines were in fact invalid and I sought to rely on that invalidity.' `To do so,' he said, `would be immoral.' Failure to plead his own default would be immoral and therefore, for sound ethical reasons, he took that absolutely astonishing course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is appalling! What faith can the ordinary taxpayer have in government in this country when ministers are prepared to act in that way? What sort of fair go are they going to have when ministers rely on their own default to demonstrate invalidity in a guideline and therefore to argue against the taxpayer? This minister should be ashamed that he has come in here today. I can only presume that somebody has written this extra answer for him and he failed to read it before he read  it out here today. He should be ashamed of what he has done today. It only compounds his default in this whole sorry saga that we are going to hear a lot about even later today when we seek to get on the public record the relevant documents and start to explore how a default of this consequence could have possibly occurred and how for a year&mdash;apparently it was a year before it took any remedial action&mdash;the department was aware of the default. This is just another step, but it is a sorry and disappointing step that the minister came in with an answer of that type today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan, in seeking to explain why no response had been given to question No. 2123 within 30 days, stated that the question I had asked was of a detailed nature and required a lot of research. I ask this question&mdash;for Senator Cook's benefit I ask it in a rhetorical fashion, not in a `rhet-rical' fashion and I hope that Senator Cook accepts that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that the National Media Liaison Service seems to have this absolutely unique capacity to do research on everybody else other than itself. It has not been able to come up with the answers to these questions in 30 days, and they are fairly easy questions: firstly, what was the name, designation, office location and remuneration of each member of staff as at 31 March 1995? That is not a matter of great research, I would have thought. Secondly, which staff members are permanent public servants, and what was each person's level prior to taking up the present position? I would have thought that that was not a very difficult question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, what is the entitlement of each staff member for telephone or car allowance, Commonwealth car, for personal uses, and what are any other entitlements? Once again, I would have thought that that would all be readily available. Fourthly, in relation to ex-ministerial staff members who have been employed with either the National Media Liaison Service or the Ministerial Media Group since 1 January 1990&mdash;and all we are really asking about, as I understand it, are seven people&mdash;what are their names, their ministerial designations, their remuneration, and things of that nature?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noteworthy that, when I first raised the issue about ex-ministerial staff in the National Media Liaison Service, Mr Epstein indicated that he thought there was only one. He then had to write to me to confirm that that answer was wrong. If he knew that that answer was wrong when he wrote to me, one would anticipate that Mr Epstein&mdash;the on-again, off-again Director of the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;would have had the capacity to tell us why he was able to tell us that it was wrong. The fact that it was wrong was undoubtedly because he had researched the issue himself and had come to a determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions I have asked do not, with respect, in any way require a great degree of detail. In fact, the answers to the first three questions should all be readily available, and only a very small amount of research would be required for the fourth question. What all this indicates is another chapter in a very sorry and sad history in trying to get information about the National Media Liaison Service. We on this side of the Senate are being obstructed every single step of the way when we try to get to the truth of how the National Media Liaison Service is conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware of the very real concerns we have on this side that the National Media Liaison Service, which is funded to the tune of $1.5 million by the taxpayers of this country, is being used for party political purposes by the Australian Labor Party and the government. The Auditor-General sought to have an inquiry into the National Media Liaison Service and was told that, on technical grounds, he could not inquire into it. So, at Senate estimates, we requested that the National Media Liaison Service be considered and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At those estimates hearings, we had the most unedifying experience of the minister at the table, Senator McMullan, not even being able to tell us what the total budget was for the National Media Liaison Service. That is the sort of preparation that this government comes to estimates committees with. If the government does not even know what the total budget is, you cannot really get much further in an estimates hearing. As a result of that, this Senate moved a motion requiring a further and supplementary hearing of the relevant estimates committee into the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the degree of obfuscation that has now been widely reported in the media where people such as Mr Epstein, despite having signed letters as the Director of the National Media Liaison Service, have now tried to deny that he ever has been or was the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. Completely unbelievable! Even his own minister, Kim Beazley, when he wrote on 9 February to the estimates committee inquiring into the National Media Liaison Service referred to Mr Epstein as the Director of the Ministerial Media Group and Director of the National Media Liaison Service. His own minister refers to him as such, but he still denies it. Indeed, at the last lot of estimates that we had just a few days ago, Minister McMullan was still seeking to deny that Mr Epstein was the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson interjects and asks, `Who was the director of the National Media Liaison Service?' We still do not really have an answer to that very proper question that Senator Watson has raised. For over a month now&mdash;pretty well five weeks&mdash;I have waited for answers to the simple questions I have just read out to the Senate. It reflects very badly on the minister, on the government and in particular on the National Media Liaison Service, which has this unique capacity to investigate everybody else and get all their history out on the public record for party-political purposes but is unable to get out its own record of appointments, staff members, their entitlements and things of that nature. Clearly it has adopted a double standard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to the level of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>I referred the minister to the infamous promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before the 1993 election not to put up tax. That is what he said baldly and then he subsequently refined that to say that he would not put up tax as a proportion of GDP. The minister waffled around at great length today and tried to say that what the Prime Minister was saying was that it would stick within the ballpark figure as a percentage of GDP. He claimed that an increase since that statement of 2.1 per cent in the proportion of GDP that the tax takes up is a figure within the range. And 2.1 per cent is more than $10,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in this year's budget tax is forecast to increase from 22.1 per cent&mdash;the figure in the year of the Prime Minister's promise&mdash;to 24.2 per cent of GDP this year. That is in excess of $10,000 million&mdash;equal to $1,700 per household, or almost $600 for every man, woman and child in Australia. That is the extent of the election deceit and the tax fraud deceit that the Prime Minister rorted on the Australian electorate prior to the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at some of the other figures, there is no doubt at all that this Prime Minister, Mr Keating, is the highest taxing Prime Minister in Australia's history. He is also the Prime Minister who has broken more promises than any Prime Minister in Australia's history. And so far as tax promises are concerned, he is the greatest tax promise fraud in Australia's history. The figures for this budget reveal that in stark terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the financial year just coming up, the government is going to increase its total revenue by $14.2 billion&mdash;$14,200 million. Personal income tax is going to go up by almost 10 per cent&mdash;almost $14 billion. The total tax take is going to go up by almost $14 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of the percentages. In real terms the total income tax take on individuals is going up, so when you take inflation into account, you have to add another three per cent or four per cent on top of that. But even in real terms, after taking out inflation, taxation from individuals is going to rise by a whopping 9.6 per cent. The total sales tax take, after taking out inflation, is going to rise 18 per cent this year. So in dollar terms it is going to be an increase of something like two per cent. The total tax revenue is going to go up by a percentage well over nine per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, looking at revenue as a whole&mdash;tax plus other revenue&mdash;for the year just completed, this year and next year combined, we are going to see the greatest tax revenue increase since the infamous Whitlam budgets of the 1970s which absolutely wrecked the Australian economy. The great danger that underlies this present budget is that we are going to see a repeat of yet more of those disastrous policy failures that we saw under the Whitlam government which took years and years, if ever, to correct in the Australian economy and which are sowing the seeds for major future damage of the Australian economy. It is an absolute disgrace for the government to be so complacent about the economic and tax situations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had sought leave during question time to incorporate a table headed, `Income tax and average earnings 1966-67 to 1993-94'. I did that because I have found in this place that if you want to nail a lie, you have to nail it right at the time that it is done, otherwise it goes over the head of most people. This table shows, for example, that tax as a proportion of income has increased over time for both family groups and single income earners, with tax for the single person increasing from 15.5 per cent to 23.7 per cent and, for the family, increasing from 5.9 per cent to 16 per cent of income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase has been much greater for the family than for the single person. The family is now paying nearly 2 3/4times the proportion of income in tax than it did in 1966-67, while the single person is paying 1 1/2 times. In 1988-89, the peak year for tax as a proportion of income, the family paid 3 1/3times more than in 1966-67, compared with 1 2/3times for the single person. The marginal tax rate has generally increased over the period: for families, from 22.1c to 36.9c in the dollar; and, for single persons, from 27.8c to 36.9c. For both, the rate peaked at 47c in 1984-85 and 1985-86. The proportion of family tax to single person tax increased from 38 per cent in 1966-67, peaked at over 75 per cent in 1988-89 and dropped back marginally to 67 per cent by 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion from this table is that the gradual increase in tax as a proportion of income has been due predominantly to bracket creep, whereby increases in income either move the income earner into a higher marginal tax bracket or move a greater amount of income into the marginal tax bracket. This has had a more dramatic effect as the number of tax brackets has decreased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 1973-74, there were 29 brackets. This was reduced to 14 in 1974-75, seven in 1975-76 and four from February 1978. Since that time, the number of brackets has varied up to a maximum of six. The family group has also</PARA>
<PARA>been affected by the long periods when the family allowance and the dependent spouse rebate&mdash;or similar concessional deductions&mdash;remained unchanged. This was especially so from 1967-68 to 1971-72 and from 1983-84 to 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures clearly demonstrate that what Senator Cook said was untrue. The facts speak for themselves. Legally, what I said can be proved. The table clearly demonstrates that when we were last in government the proportion of average weekly earnings was 22.9 per cent for the single income earner; it is now 23.7 per cent. For the average family earner it was 14.1 per cent; it is now 16 per cent as a proportion of total earnings. That gives the lie to the statement made previously.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Christopher Evans this day, relating to an industrial dispute in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the Labor Party's performance on the waterfront and shipping reform. A lot of light, noise and heat have been developed&mdash;by Senator Collins in particular, when he was the minister. His activities in the area culminated with the now famous meeting with then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Senator Collins giving funny interjections about getting lung cancer because Prime Minister Hawke smoked so many cigars that night. We all remember Senator Collins saying he would resign if he did not reform the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality for Australia, for its exporters and importers and, therefore, for Australian consumers, is that Australia's waterfront has not improved compared with the situation of our trading partners and competitors. What the Western Australian dispute is about&mdash;and it needs to be stated, because I believe Senator McMullan misrepresented it and used his ideological blinkers to put his ideological spin on the facts around the dispute in Western Australia&mdash;is that the Western Australian Stateships organisation and the managers of that organisation, whom I do not know, sought to ensure that the most competitive quote from a stevedoring company won; and was used to provide that service to Stateships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan has come into this place on many occasions when I have asked him questions about Commonwealth owned business entities and said that they must be independent and must behave in a competitively neutral way that ensures that they do not compete unfairly against the private sector. He is now coming in and saying that Stateships should not be allowed to enter into a contractual obligation with a stevedoring company. The person in this chamber with the ideological blinkers on in this dispute is Senator McMullan. I also suspect Senator Chris Evans, but I will not accuse him of that because his views are not yet on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stateships or any other state organisation or quasi-government business enterprise cannot go out into the marketplace and say that it needs services provided&mdash;in this case, it is a shipping company&mdash;and then look at the tenders, contracts and bids. Stateships chose a company which I understand is owned by Len Buckeridge. This company employs non-union labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union monopoly in Western Australian ports, particularly in Fremantle, has ensured that, regardless of the commercial nature of a negotiation between Stateships and the stevedoring company owned by Mr Buckeridge, it cannot be done. It is not a free world when you enter the ports of Western Australia; it is a closed world. We go back to an old world where there is a monopoly. Regardless of the democratically elected government or the contractual obligations and negotiations between commercial entities, being Stateships on the one hand and a stevedoring company on the other, the trade union movement was prepared to close down the ports of Western Australia because it was not happy with the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, any agreement that is done in a port in Western Australia must get the approval of the unions that operate on awards in Western Australia. It is like getting an agreement and taking it down to the stamp office when stamp duty is paid. It is not an agreement until the state stamp duty is paid on it. In the ports in Western Australia, one has to get the unions in the workplace to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing about that is that ultimately Western Australia is held to ransom. The business interests of Western Australia said to Richard Court, the premier, `You have to get this sorted out. You are killing us.' But it was not the government or the premier that was killing business; it was the trade unions. This handful of people have had their special place in legal affairs in Australia enshrined by this federal Labor government. They have a position at the bargaining table even when they are not part of the bargain. They are prepared to hold to ransom the whole of Western Australia until they get their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a disgraceful set of affairs. This government has stood by the trans-Tasman accord, which has meant that shipping between Australia and New Zealand is far more expensive than it needs to be. It stands by a system of cabotage, which ensures that coastal shipping in Australia is far more expensive than it needs to be. It has created a waterfront monopoly that is very little better than it was in the early 1980s. We still have the most expensive waterfronts in the world. That costs Australia's consumers. That reform is crucial if Australia is to create opportunities for people to gain employment in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ian Macdonald this day, relating to sales tax on building materials.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ian Macdonald's question highlights the fact that the Australian people have been misled in terms of the impact of the sales tax on building hardware. Budget paper No. 1 indicates that the government will extend the wholesale sales tax to building materials. But the government and the budget papers have not told us that the wholesale sales tax will not only apply to materials but also, in many cases, to the labour component and to oncosts, particularly in the joinery workshop. Even the honourable Senator Murphy has been misled by the government's propaganda on this. If in doubt, I ask him to refer to the Australian Taxation Office or any joinery workshop. One could be completely misled in relation to this matter by the budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take, for example, the ordinary joiner who completes a cupboard arrangement to put into a new home. If prepared in the joinery shop, this may have to have sales tax applied to the material content added value. Then there is a cost allocation problem between certain of the material which he might buy as green timber and other timber which the joiner processes through cutting and planing on the job in the joinery. The joinery then adds labour cost and also factory service cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means, of course, that there is a major problem, because the work done in the joinery is going to have the sales tax applicable to the labour content in addition to maybe some of the materials&mdash;if not all of the materials&mdash;depending on their origin and how the component parts are put together. It is no use shaking your head, Senator Murphy&mdash;the sales tax does apply to the labour cost of gluing and fixing and putting together in the joinery shop. That is well understood and has been confirmed by all appropriate authorities. However, this is not stated in these budget papers, and could be where there is a discrepancy between Senator Cook's sales tax estimate and the figure Senator Schacht provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know&mdash;ask any joinery around town&mdash;whose figure is more correct, and it will certainly be in the order of $1,000 or more. That is the figure that Senator Schacht has quoted. The figure for sales tax on hardware that is in the budget papers is hopelessly inadequate for a normal family home and shows the inability of the government to get down and consult with reality&mdash;the people who produce the cupboards for the kitchens and bathrooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This hardware sales tax extension is going to create all sorts of tax audit difficulties between the tax office and the small joinery shop, because, for instance, there is no sales tax on the installation costs in the home. Therefore, the shonky builders will take all their basic materials along to the client's home and try to construct the kitchen or bathroom renovation there and argue, `This is an installation cost, thereby avoiding sales tax. It is not a joinery cost.' There will be problems of avoidance compliance&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A massive problem with compliance costs, because all small joinery shops will inevitably be subject to tax audit in relation to these demarcation issues. It is true that the installation costs are not going to be subject to sales tax, whereas the costs of putting work together in the joinery shop will be subject to sales tax. It is in the joinery operation where cost efficiencies occur&mdash;not in putting the fixture together in the client's home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a client orders a kitchen package off the shelf, it has a 12 per cent tax applied on the wholesale or the nominal wholesale price including labour. Admittedly, there are not a lot of builders who engage in this particular type of activity, but there are some&mdash;and it is usually the larger ones. Again, this whole activity has the sales tax applicable not only to the material components&mdash;the nails and the screws and the bolts, as we were led to believe&mdash;but also to the labour components other than for installation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you that we are going to have a new era of backyard builders doing renovation work, doing it outside tax audit verification paperwork, and with a lack of disclosure to the tax office in terms of non-disclosure for income tax purposes. We are going to see a situation of backyarders doing the job and not reporting their income as required. So the government is actually creating a situation of potential tax avoidance. This government believes it has a credible record in trying to wipe out the cash economy. However, I tell you here and now that the government has introduced something in this budget that is going to create a massive problem in terms of the black economy and is going to result in a lot of honest builders losing their jobs. </PARA>

<PARA>The sorry saga of Australia Television International joins that stable of other nobbled horses of David Hill, who was the Managing Director of the ABC and innovator in the area of ABC products and programs. We have already seen, within a period of three months since a major inquiry into the ABC earlier this year, a number of David Hill's innovations to commercialise ABC operations go belly up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the case of BNA&mdash;Broadcast News Australia&mdash;which was set up as a rival to AAP. Three months ago it had glowing prospects for the future but now the government is about to wind it up. In his answer today the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) mentioned the prospect of Australia Television International also being in huge difficulties and facing, as one alternative, the possibility of being wound up. One waits with some trepidation to see the fate of pay TV, another venture into the commercial world by the ABC. The prospects of pay TV are under some sort of a cloud given the ABC's track record on commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under David Hill's stewardship we have seen a great change in the way in which the ABC operates. In an attempt to get extra revenue, the ABC has moved into a whole range of fringe activities, largely driven by the great enthusiasm of David Hill and not by any sort of commercial sense or preparedness to operate these commercial ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to focus on Australia Television International. I believe we would all support the concept that we should have a showcase for Australia in the Asia Pacific region. Australia Television International had the potential to do that but the government went about it in a ham-fisted way and put the future of the project in great jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, the government tried to fund Australia Television International with a seed capital of $5.4 million&mdash;which was obviously greatly inadequate&mdash;and make up the rest by commercial sponsorship. The marketing program was grossly inadequate in trying to work out whether it had markets and audiences. Sponsorships were supposed to be the main mechanism of finance. While they have not gone down significantly, they have certainly not fulfilled their projections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the greatest worry for the parliament is where the whole operation goes from here. One of the rather disturbing options that came out of the Senate hearings was the idea of combining the whole thing with Radio Australia. The danger in doing that is that we are combining a charter core activity, which is funded under the ABC budget, with a commercial activity which is supposed to be in the main funded by commercial sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cultures of the two organisations are quite incompatible and the government should think very carefully if it is to go down this track. At hearings of estimates committees the government was a little coy about this. I suggest to the government that it might consider a different option altogether. It should declare Australia Television International part of the core activity of the ABC and fund it properly with a $4 million injection per year. It could have some commercial sponsorship as additional revenue. In that way the whole thing could be done properly and not on a shoestring. That will help us to have a window or a showcase on Australian products. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Sandy Macdonald this day, relating to private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian people are not satisfied with the government's handling of health; nor should they be. In particular, the continued decrease in the number of people taking private health insurance has to be addressed if our current health system is to survive. The recent decrease in membership to just over 35 per cent should be sounding alarm bells to the government. It is the biggest fall since the March 1994 quarter when a 0.8 per cent fall was recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 the drop in private health insurance membership was 2.1 per cent. Calculated on the latest quarterly figures, 1995 will see a further drop of 2.8 per cent. When Labor came to power, private health care membership was over 60 per cent. It has now dropped well past the critical point of 40 per cent referred to by the former health minister, Graham Richardson. Bearing in mind that each percentage point fall represents $100 million extra burden on the public health system, the situation is at crisis point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, is attempting to rescue the public health system by increasing the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent and, in doing so, has broken another Labor promise. This government's reforms have failed low and middle income earners, the very people that the Labor Party claims to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent nationwide survey identified our health system as one in crisis. Just over half of those surveyed believed our health services were getting worse, and 44 per cent thought that those services would continue to decline. Very few people felt that they were getting value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, 74 per cent of people felt that senior politicians, such as our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the health minister, should have private health insurance. But why would they have private health cover when this government offers no incentives to encourage private health cover membership. For people in country and regional areas, the nearest hospital or specialist might not have a contract with their health service, so those with private health cover may be prejudiced and not able to utilise fully the current arrangements between the government, hospitals and specialists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the Prime Minister cannot be persuaded to join is that the services provided are entirely unattractive, even to him. I believe that welfare assistance should be about helping those who cannot afford to help themselves, and they happen to be the low income earners who are subsidising the higher income earners, including the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The latest OECD report identifies the fact that Labor's health insurance viewpoint is confused and has no real idea about whether private insurance should be a substitute for or a top up of public funding arrangements. What kind of message is this government sending out to people? It is a message that this government is tired, unsure of what it should do with its health care system, and incapable of meeting the problems in health that it has created. It is certainly not meeting the expectations of low and middle income families who are looking to a situation where they can have appropriate, proper and good health cover.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)notes that Commonwealth Bank officers were not in attendance to answer questions at the estimates hearings of the Economics Legislation Committee in June 1995, in spite of the significant public interest in the employment and other implications of the bank's decisions; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)directs that Mr Ian Payne, Executive Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, attend the supplementary estimates hearing of the Economics Legislation Committee to answer questions concerning the bank's staffing and headquarters arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>At the estimates hearings last week I gave notice that I wished Commonwealth Bank officers to attend the hearing to answer questions relating to staffing matters and headquarter arrangements at the Commonwealth Bank. I gave due notice and heard nothing from the government or the bank until, at the committee hearing, I was informed by Senator Cook that the Commonwealth Bank officers were not in attendance and, rather, that Treasury officers would be available to answer questions relating to the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury officers duly appeared. The first question I asked was: what is the current staffing level at the Commonwealth Bank? No-one had any idea. The Treasury officers were clearly not briefed to answer questions; nor were they prepared to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing orders of the Senate make very clear that this chamber has the right to direct attendance of persons and documents at legislative committee hearings. Standing order 19(9) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee and any sub-committee shall have power to send for persons and documents, to move from place to place, and to meet and transact business in public or private session&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The standing order goes on. We have the right to require Commonwealth Bank officers to attend an estimates committee hearing and the standing orders of the Senate make that absolutely clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in the past, of course, the Commonwealth Bank has appeared. The last time that I can recall that happening was in June 1993. Honourable senators might ask: why an estimates hearing and not perhaps a more general and special reference to a Senate committee? The answer is that these are issues which I believe relate to staffing and headquarters matters. They are matters which are of public interest and it is appropriate that these issues be raised before an estimates committee, given the huge level of investment of the Commonwealth in that particular bank, even though the government in due course intends to privatise the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, ministers are worried about it. Unlike at an ordinary meeting of a Senate committee, the minister will be in attendance. Senator Cook is looking confused. As it happens to be an estimates committee hearing, the minister will be in attendance, and that provides, I suspect, some comfort for the officers of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it does. That provides some comfort for the officers of the Commonwealth Bank about the nature of the questions which will be asked. I put it to the Senate that this would never have arisen if the Commonwealth Bank had continued with the practice it had over the previous two or three years and provided me with clear-cut answers as to precisely what is happening to employment levels at the bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular interest in this because I am a Victorian. It is very clear that there have been massive retrenchments of Commonwealth Bank officers in that state and a large number&mdash;some hundreds, maybe up to 1,000&mdash;of forced redundancies. I am anxious to put straightforward questions to the bank&mdash;not to intrude into any issues of commercial-in-confidence but to put straightforward questions to the bank as to precisely what is happening with its staffing arrangements and what has happened in the past&mdash;so that the public can be aware of the consequences of this particular bank merger and the people who are Commonwealth Bank officers will have the chance to feel that the Commonwealth parliament is starting to address the very real concerns that they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the standing orders make it quite clear that the Senate has the right to require the presence of Commonwealth Bank officials at an estimates hearing. For the sensitivities of those opposite who may be worried that somehow this will lead to an abuse of the system, Commonwealth bank officers have appeared before Senate committees before but, in this particular case, they will have the additional protection of a minister being in attendance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not interested in pursuing matters which are commercial-in-confidence. I am interested in finding out the precise facts of what has happened with the staffing arrangements in the bank. I believe the motion is responsible. The need for it would not have arisen had the Commonwealth Bank continued with the practice it was prepared to follow until recent months and supplied me with information on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Senate will pass this motion. We will be requiring the attendance of Commonwealth Bank officers at the estimates hearing. The government will be arguing that it is an independent organisation, but it is not a matter in the end for the government. The government cannot argue on the one hand that the bank is an independent bank and, on the other hand, instruct the bank not to appear before a Senate estimates committee. That is a dilemma that Senator Robert Ray will have to effectively address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To summarise, this motion would never have arisen had the Commonwealth Bank been prepared to answer questions which have been answered before, particularly those relating to the staffing levels at the bank. In the context of questions at Senate estimates committee, I am prepared to respect the issues which are commercially sensitive, but there is no argument, either for the government or for the bank, to rule out questions which may be politically sensitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank, I believe&mdash;and the figures demonstrate this&mdash;has got itself into one awful mess in Victoria. It has in an arrogant way been carrying out a massive restructuring of the bank without properly taking the public into its confidence and involving itself in compulsory retrenchments of workers, quite contrary to the promises that were given by Mr Keating and, at the time of the merger, the assurances given by the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As there is an informal agreement to keep this debate fairly short, I put it to the Senate that this is a responsible motion. It is a motion that will ensure that there are proper protections available to the Commonwealth Bank officers. At the same time, it will ensure that the Commonwealth Bank officers and the Commonwealth Bank answer valid questions to the Senate as to precisely what is happening with the staffing arrangements at that bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it clear that I have no objection to the Commonwealth Bank appearing before that committee. My objection lies in their appearing in the estimates process. The estimates process is about expenditure of government money and the accountability of it; ministers sit at the table and answer the questions&mdash;presumably only about the current financial year. But with a degree of agreement and tradition, we let those questions develop right across the line into a whole range of policy areas, quite properly. That is the tradition. What Senator Kemp is doing today is setting a new precedent. He is saying that government businesses enterprises, whatever their nature, should appear in the estimates process.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what you are saying. You are saying that a government business enterprise whose employees are not public servants should be brought before the estimates committee and be cross-examined. I say to you, Senator Kemp: if you want to talk to the Commonwealth Bank about all its plans, do it in the context of its annual report to this parliament. Then, quite properly, you can ask exactly the same questions. I am sure no-one is going to object to your asking those questions&mdash;with no minister present&mdash;because they have to report and be responsible to this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things are not the same with the Commonwealth Bank now as they may have been five years ago. The bank is now 49 per cent owned by shareholders. So you want to bring non-public servants into a process that traditionally has ministers and public servants, and cross-examine them in that context when they have got responsibilities under such things as the Companies Act. It is no use saying at this stage, Senator Kemp, that you want to quarantine this. I believe you want to, but I have also seen the way things start to move out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that you are entitled to cross-examine the Commonwealth Bank in the context of its annual report. You can do it any month of the year&mdash;you can do it tonight, you can do it next week&mdash;and you can use your powers on a Senate committee to bring whoever you want to into the room and ask them whatever questions you want. Obviously, if you stray into those areas of commercial-in-confidence, you will not get an answer. Let me tell you this: no minister is going to be mug enough to sit in the same room and take total responsibility for the veracity of arguments and evidence that they do not have any fundamental responsibility for. If some officer, be it of the Commonwealth Bank or of some other GBE, misleads, why should a minister be responsible when they are not within his employ?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For heaven's sake! You are setting a precedent here that you are going to live to regret. You have an easy opportunity to get exactly the answers you want. What you are doing is picking the wrong process&mdash;you are picking the estimates committee process rather than the powers those committees have been generously granted under consideration of annual reports. You might say that standing orders say that that is a mistake, frankly. In my view, that is a translation&mdash;because of the restructuring of the committee system&mdash;that left powers in that were never conceived, or believed, to apply to estimates committees. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did. I remember that I was also involved in all the discussions around the restructuring of the committee system&mdash;all of them. It was made clear by us that Senate estimates committees did not have the power to bring witnesses. Leaving that aside, what you are doing today is saying that a minister in an estimates committee process has to have sitting next to him witnesses whom he does not employ. If you expect the minister to then be responsible for the answers they give, when he has no power to know whether they are true or false or otherwise, you are setting a very bad precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made the offer of a totally alternative, legitimate process covered by standing orders in which you can pursue these questions this week, next week or the week after. Why won't you? What is so magical about the estimates process? Estimates are about government expenditure, the bills that authorise government expenditure, and accountability therein. That is what they are about. It has nothing to do with cross-examining or witch-hunting GBEs&mdash;nothing at all. I believe that what you are doing here is in breach of all of the agreements we had&mdash;not that you were necessarily party to them&mdash;when we redesigned this committee system to make it work effectively. It is short-sighted&mdash;but may be typical of the opposition, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You believe that you will be in office within a year. If you carry this today, I look forward to you setting the precedent where every government GBE comes into the estimates process. You will totally regret it. It is a short-term opportunist gain, and it is unnecessary because there is an alternative approach equally able to be exercised by any Senate committee; that is, the consideration of an annual report. If I were the minister in charge of that estimates committee, I would refuse&mdash;and rightly refuse&mdash;to appear before an estimates committee for people who are not in my employ giving evidence. I know short-term opportunism will probably prevail again today. All I can say is that one day I will say, `I told you so.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not Senator Ray; I know that. However, it is on record. I specifically asked it, and I asked it very carefully. I suggest that you check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> carefully, because I specifically wanted to know whether that was the case. People would know what the Greens' position is about the fact&mdash;and the very frightening fact&mdash;that was just put in parentheses by Senator Ray: that he considers that there is no ministerial responsibility over government business enterprises. Yet, in the same speech, he said he would refuse permission for officers to attend. If you have got no power over the officers of a particular department, it is a bit bizarre to refuse them permission to attend an estimates committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite possible for any estimates committee to call witnesses. It is not compulsory, I believe, for a minister to attend; it is the choice of the minister if he wishes to protect a particular area under the minister's portfolio. But if the particular minister whose portfolio related to that government business enterprise chose not to attend, then so be it. That would probably give those senators on the committee access to more honest replies from the people whom they are questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my estimation, it is wrong for totally owned government business enterprises to not have a clear line of accountability to those people whose resources they are using; that is, taxpayers. Whatever you and the government like to say, if they are wholly owned government business enterprises, it is taxpayers' funds that they are using. The way they use them interacts with various budget items. In fact, there are particular areas in a budget estimates program&mdash;the Defence program springs to mind&mdash;in which the interactions of governments with government business enterprises ought to be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely difficult questioning the government without the business enterprise; it is extremely difficult questioning the business enterprise without the government. It is quite ludicrous, but it is possible. It is possible, according to the answer given to me during debate on the corporations bills, for the Senate or for the estimates committee to call a government business enterprise to present evidence to them. If that is not possible, then perhaps we all ought to refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that debate and recheck it and find out what extra information ought now to be given to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to speak for very long, but it is quite clear that over time, whilst we still have government business enterprises which are wholly owned by the government&mdash;it is not the government that owns them; it is in reality the taxpayers of Australia&mdash;they ought to be accountable to someone. The minimum responsibility of accountability in relation to major expenditures which may impact on revenue ought to be on the elected representatives of the parliament, especially when there are government plans to sell most government business enterprises and their actions impact on the price that a government business enterprise eventually gets on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be that the Greens agree with the wholesale sell-off of government business enterprises, but if the actions of government business enterprises may be impacting adversely on their selling price, that of course should be of interest to the taxpayer, who will be impacted upon by the outcome. Therefore government business enterprises have the right to, and should in a reasonable situation be required to, present evidence to a Senate estimates committee if the elected majority of this place should so require them to. </PARA>

I think that is an important concession and is certainly welcomed. I thought we could bring them before the estimates committee process because the estimates committee process is now in train. My questions were particularly specific and it seemed to me that the fairest and easiest way to move in this direction and to address any concerns of commercial-in-confidence was to use this process as the appropriate vehicle. </PARA>

<PARA>Science in Australia is in a very parlous state as a direct consequence of the attitude and policies of this Labor government. Without a rapid and significant change in this attitude it is clear that basic and strategic scientific research will continue to decline in amount and quality thus removing the very base on which much of our applied research depends. Even more importantly, the role of science as a cultural building block of a scientifically literate society will be further weakened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As more of the senior scientists in our universities and institutes reach retirement age, the quality of science in Australia will deteriorate more quickly and we will reach a stage from which it will be very difficult to recover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental fault with this government is that it has conceived many activities which have a wide social context, such as education and scientific research&mdash;and, one might add, even the arts&mdash;merely as elements in its economic program. Education is about more than shaping the human cogs to fit into an economic rationalist's dream of his perfect but mechanistic and inhuman world. Science is about more than being the handmaiden of a more productive industry and, like the arts and general education, is about the creations and satisfactions of the human spirit and the understanding of the world in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to say that education, science and the arts have no place to play in economic life or profitability, they do, but it is to say that their importance extends far beyond this narrower focus and to attempt, as the government has done, to confine these activities in this way is to lose much of their value. Paradoxically, the spontaneous and the creative, the serendipitous, provide the wellspring from which the applied and the technically profitable derive. Thus these elements which have become so neglected under this government are the very elements which will continue to sustain the technological efforts of Australian industry in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress this point at the beginning, for debates like this tend to bog down very quickly in details about funding and on how many dollars are spent here and there and the general context in which these matters tend to become lost. I am sure the minister will attempt, in his contribution, to avoid this important philosophical point and will attempt to smother the debate with numbers of dollars. So this addresses the first point in the urgency debate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps just one indicator of the very low status given to science by this government is that on budget night several weeks ago the computers in our parliamentary offices were provided with over four megabytes of information on the budget at exactly 8 p.m. immediately after the budget speech had concluded. This material consisted of nine files, the contents of two of which were not immediately available. A quick search&mdash;and one of the advantages of computers is that you can do this&mdash;of this four megabytes of material contained not a single mention of science. The word science did not appear once in any of that material. And, incidentally, the word environment appeared only once in relation to the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning now to some of the figures: it is estimated that Australia spends approximately 1.3 per cent of its GDP on scientific research. I know the government will try to maintain that the figure is 1.5 per cent, but this depends on allocating an arbitrary percentage of higher education funding to research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubtful whether the percentage used can be supported. For while the total amount going into higher education has increased since the Australian Labor Party came to government in 1983, the numbers of students have risen at a faster rate, so the amount available per student has actually declined and the pressure on university lecturers and research scientists has resulted in less money and time for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talk to any university lecturer in science and this is precisely what you will find. According to the Australian vice-chancellors, in 1991 the per capita student allocation in universities had fallen 11 per cent compared with 1983 and was still eight per cent less in 1993. It was 10 per cent less than it was in 1975. Thus the percentage of funds available out of this pot specifically for research from the higher education allocation is certainly less than the arbitrary 30 per cent, which is the figure that I am sure the government will shortly use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of quality in student education combined with the emphasis on personal competition, material acquisitiveness and the lack of a clear career path for scientists has resulted in a fall in the quality of students entering science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparison of the entry scores of students into 36 Australian universities shows that while medicine attracts the best students, science is among the least attractive. On a scale of one to five in which one is the highest, medicine scored one in every university while science did not score one in a single university. In other words, we have not a single university in this country with a reputation in science so high that it attracts the best students. Put another way, while medicine takes 99.8 per cent of its students from the upper quartile and none from the lower quartile, science takes only 22 per cent from the upper quartile and 24 per cent from the lowest. On the one to five scale, averaged across all universities, science scored 4.2, only marginally above nursing which scored the lowest at 4.5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poorer entry of students into science, lack of funding and lack of emphasis on fundamental, basic and strategic research have resulted in a fall in the relative science citation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Burke and Linda Butler of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University published a monograph last year called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A crisis for Australian science</EMPHASIS>. The paper considers the rate of science of publication and citation for Australian scientists for the period 1982-91. They explain that they were led to this study by the publication in the American journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science watch</EMPHASIS> of figures which showed a decline in the impact of Australian scientific publication as measured by science in the indices of the Institute of Scientific Information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One measure of the output of scientific research is the number of papers published. However, the quantity of published papers varies widely and a much better measure of productivity is the rate of citation of papers. This is the number of times that other scientists quote a published paper; that is, its use of results to build on to their own output. A paper which breaks new ground and opens new fields for inquiry may be cited many hundreds of times by later workers, whereas one that fills a relatively trivial corner of an established discipline may be cited only a few times or not at all. The citation rate is thus a direct measure of the quality and importance of science and of the published work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burke and Butler show that, while Australia's share of world scientific publications fell marginally in 1992-93 from 1.95 per cent to 1.9 per cent, our share of citations fell more steeply from 1.95 per cent to 1.55 per cent and that this was especially steep in the years 1988-91. In other words, there has been a very steep decline in the quality of Australian science since 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on a calculated relative citation index, these authors showed that, averaged across all disciplines, there has been an eight per cent decline in the index&mdash;but with a wide variation between disciplines. When asked about this decline, some witnesses at our CSIRO inquiry last year pointed out that this may be due to the fact that more of their work was directed towards local problems. However, in the agricultural area, Australia's work has held up quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning very briefly to funding, one finds that Australia spends relatively small amounts on its science. While the ratio of government to private funding favours the government, compared with that in many other countries, the absolute amount as well as the amount expressed as a percentage of GDP does not compare favourably with that in many other countries. Non-government spending on research has been growing strongly in recent years, but from a very small base. Government has not recognised that most of the very large firms in Australia are foreign and conduct most of their research overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US Congress, late last year, adopted a science appropriation budget of 2.6 per cent of GDP, exactly twice that of Australia. One might remark, in passing, that South Korea has a budget of five per cent of GDP, which it spends on science. Compared with a number of other countries, we are not performing well in terms of our expenditure, the education of our scientists, the opportunities given to science or the amount of basic and strategic research which is being conducted in this country.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to defend the government's record and, somewhat bemusedly, to try to comprehend what Senator Coulter is driving at. The record, as he should know, does not support the contentions of his motion. He says in his opening remarks that science in Australia is in a parlous state due to the government; but the government is not guilty as charged. Let me not rely on my own assertions to establish that fact. I turn to the 18 May edition of the international science journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> in which Sir John Maddox, in his review of Australia's science after a recent visit to our shores, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general conclusion is that Australian science is in good shape . . . Australia may at last have found the right arrangements for the management of publicly supported research . . . industrial research spending has been growing quickly, more quickly than in any other OECD country.</PARA>
<PARA>In another journal, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS>, also a benchmark magazine for scientists, its review of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you take any of the conventional measures of scientific excellence, whether it be numbers of Nobel prize winners, scientific papers published, citations per paper, heads of international conferences, and so on, then Australia does extremely well for its GNP and population.</PARA>
<PARA>To go back further, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a pity . . . Australians . . . seem never to have felt too good about their own scientific prowess, even though it is widely recognised abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the government but the international science community which is passing judgment on the level of science in Australia. By any measure, it is a testimony to a government which is switched on to this subject and is performing well. It is something that Australians, as a community, should be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other cheap shot in Senator Coulter's opening remarks was the reference to budget night. He said that on 9 May, budget night&mdash;a Tuesday&mdash;there was no reference in the budget to science. Senator Coulter, you would know that the document I am now waving in the Senate was tabled on the Thursday after budget. It is a statement by me, as the responsible minister. It is headed, `Science and Technology: budget statement 1995-96.' It runs to over 180 pages. It was not out on budget night but it was out on the Thursday after, in the normal manner of these things. That paper is a comprehensive statement of the government's position on science. Dare I say that it was a cheap shot to say it was not given on the night. You omitted to tell the chamber that it was given two days later and was comprehensive, stand alone, and open to criticism and analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the government cannot be condemned in the way the motion proposes is that it is now public knowledge, and has been for many months, that we intend to bring down a major statement which will address science and technology capacity in this nation. We intend to do that in August or September this year under the heading `Innovation Statement'. We have had over a thousand consultations about it with leading companies, organisations and individuals around Australia in all capital cities and major provincial centres. We have published a book reporting all of the input. The major organisations consulted and the science community are manifold but I cite particularly the CSIRO and the Academy of Science. Both have been consulted and both have given their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter may know that we are going to have further consultations on particular matters in relation to what this motion refers to. At the annual dinner of the Academy of Science I was moved to observe&mdash;it was an observation, not a criticism&mdash;that the content of the innovation statement, in terms of what scientists had been able to put forward, was still a bit light on from the science community and I asked scientists to please consider what further information they could provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we hear talk about lack of government commitment we can cite the international arbitrators, the journals that comment on world science quality and excellence. We can look at what we have done in the budget. In Senator Kernot's response to the budget and in the response by Senator Hill, the shadow minister for science, on the Thursday following the budget, neither Senator Kernot nor Senator Hill mentioned the subject of science. That may be some indication of the priority that both the parties, which seem hell-bent on condemning our government for its record, assign to the issue of science. No-one chose to mention the subject on the very day we had put down this 180-page document saying what our record was; and what the future goals were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knew we were committed to bringing down a major statement on innovation, dealing with science and technology in Australia. It is on the public record that on many occasions I have clearly said, and I clearly state it now in the context of this motion, that Australia&mdash;and the government of Australia, as long as we are in power&mdash;is committed to proper expenditure on long-term fundamental research in this country and to developing a very active and strong applied research community. That has been the goal. We are moving towards it and we are delivering on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do I know that? Let me go to another international arbiter of performance by countries. We are a member of the OECD. What has it said in its most recent figures? Referring to GERD, gross expenditure on research and development&mdash;an index the OECD keeps and which includes scientific expenditure&mdash;Australia has moved up in the list of OECD countries from, as I recall, 16th to 13th on overall expenditure in the economy, as ranked in the OECD on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the government's proportion of that expenditure? At a time when the states have reduced expenditure on research development, including long-term fundamental research, the government has moved from a position in the OECD rankings of sixth to fourth. We have leapt over a number of other countries. We now have only three countries ahead of us in terms of total public sector expenditure on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that a record of which not to be proud? Is that not an indication of the direction of change that this government is proposing to take in research and development? Of course it is. On those clear figures, it is idle&mdash;in fact, it is improper&mdash;to criticise the government's performance. I would have thought that, with his reputation and standing in the science community, Senator Coulter would be praising that performance and holding it up as a shining example. Perhaps he would even be attending an estimates committee from time to time and putting the CSIRO scientists under scrutiny to see how, for their part, they are delivering on this sort of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot conclude the presentation on the OECD statistics without referring to the private sector. Frankly, a lot of poor comment has been made about the private sector's performance. It is true that the private sector was ranked 17th overall in the OECD on research and development expenditure. It moved up because, in the private sector in the last two OECD years, Australia increased expenditure by 28 per cent. That is a major increase in the private sector. It has moved up to the ranking of 16th. The direction of change is for further improvement to be captured and made. The private sector needs to be commended on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be recognised that we are undergoing massive economic restructuring in this country. A key element of that economic restructuring has been building a manufacturing and services base for this economy so that we are not entirely reliant on agricultural and mining exports and we have a manufacturing dimension. Every economy in the world that is ahead of us on private sector expenditure on R&amp;D is a major manufacturing or services economy. These things go together. Where there is major manufacturing, there is major research and development. As we are evolving a manufacturing base, so are we evolving higher levels of private sector expenditure on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the motion goes back to our performance. While we are talking about figures, it is worthwhile comparing the Labor government's expenditure on research and development with the expenditure of the previous Liberal government in this area. It is worthwhile because voters may make a decision about this. In real terms, expenditure by this government is 67 per cent higher than the same level of expenditure under the previous Liberal government. That is, expenditure has increased in real terms by 67 per cent under us compared with under the Liberals. In dollar terms, $1.7 billion more in real money is available to Australian science under us than was available under the previous Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basic long-term research, the subject of this urgency motion today, increased in that period by 62 per cent in real terms. Condemnation of the government obviously involves massive condemnation of the opposition, if the motion is to be held to be true. Therefore, if the opposition votes for it, it will be condemning itself by way of extending the principle that it has put. If it does, it will need to explain that. Senator Hill will be speaking next; he may be able to do it. He is quite an articulate spokesperson, but it may well be beyond his capable articulation to explain how the performance of the previous Liberal government, which is 62 per cent poorer than ours, is somehow to be held up as a shining example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the moment left to me, one of the other issues covered in Senator Coulter's comments today is students and the attraction of science for students in the Australian system. We have been conducting a major science awareness program around Australia. I hope that we can continue to expand it in the future to encourage students to see the virtue of scientific study. It is wrong to criticise performance by where the benchmark tests are set in terms of entry levels. Look at the top 10 per cent of all students at Australian universities. Twenty-five per cent of them are studying science and technology issues. Irrespective of entry level qualifications, a high level of the very best students go into this discipline. Senator Coulter should look at that figure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend Senator Coulter for bringing this matter to the attention of the parliament today. There is no doubt that the issue of the government's failures in relation to science and technology policy is of public interest and very significant national interest. It is important that the debate take place in the parliament, because we all have a responsibility to communicate to the Australian public not only the extent of the government's shortcoming in this area but also how critical to the future prosperity, security, wellbeing and quality of life of all Australians the issue of science and technology is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area has not received sufficient priority not only from this government but from governments that have preceded it. To that extent, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), in seeking to address the past, had some basis for expressing concern. This country as a whole has understated the importance of science and technology to our  future. It is time that we redress that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter raised the issue of the profile of science in the eyes of the government. The best way to assess that is really where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other senior ministers put science. We can see how they assess their priorities by their major speeches. How many major speeches have we heard from the Prime Minister on the issue of science? We hear him talking about his dream of a republic, Australia in Asia and various other things. But do we ever hear him talking about the importance of science to the future of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we ever see him laying down his blueprint for a future prosperous Australia based on the use of the highest quality science and technology? No-one ever hears that. Go back to the years of his predecessor, Mr Hawke. I can remember his so-called famous science speech in 1989. From the image of this government in the community, we can see at a glance that science and technology does not rate highly. If we can do something from a parliamentary perspective to change that, that is for the good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the priority of the government in terms of its outlay of funding. In the last budget, for example, science and technology funding declined by 0.4 per cent in real terms. The government sets its priority by a decline in funding. Total outlays on general research in 1995-96 are estimated to decrease by 1.5 per cent in real terms. That is a further demonstration of the government's priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at CSIRO, our foremost scientific institution. It is a body of which we all should be proud for its record in the past and achievements for the benefit of Australia. In this budget for 1995-96, its appropriations declined by 13 per cent in real terms. That provides some demonstration of the government's commitment to that very fine scientific institution. We are reminded that the government decided to cut CSIRO's funding by $60 million in three years. That is not a government that is really committed to that institution or to science in this country. This Prime Minister has no trouble in finding huge sums of money&mdash;hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;for projects to which he gives priority. He did this with the recent cultural statement. I am not knocking the fact that he dropped into South Australia the other day and found money for the airport and a new tunnel under Mount Lofty. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on. If you look at the Australian Institute of Marine Science&mdash;something that Senator Schacht did his best to wreck when he was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science for a short period before he was removed from that position in disgrace&mdash;you will see that in the last budget the government's expenditure on this institute declined by 3.2 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at ANSTO, the nuclear scientific organisation, you will see that for 1995-96 its budget declined 4.6 per cent in real terms; and, of course, the government is cutting a further $2 million out of its funding to engage in a safety study. That funding could have been found elsewhere, but this government chose to rip it out of ANSTO, which further demonstrates its commitment to that institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one continues. If you look at the budget papers this year, you can see what the government has done to the Commission for the Future, which only a few years ago it was holding up as a manifest demonstration of its commitment to science. It is prepared to see the end of the Commission for the Future. In the estimates the other night, the government said that, with a bit of luck, Monash University or the private sector might take over the funding. But when we questioned how much private sector money was being attracted into the Commission for the Future, it was negligible. So what that demonstrates to me is that the government has made the decision that the Commission for the Future can go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go one step further into the national space program, which Senator Ferguson knows a great deal about, we can see that this government has cut funding for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This cutback is particularly embarrassing because it comes at a time when Australian scientists in that area, two scientists and their former chief from the relevant CSIRO division, received this government's own 1995 Australian prize for pioneering satellite-based remote sensing in this country. On the one hand, you find the government almost acknowledging the quality of our science in that area and, on the other hand, when it comes to its funding priority, it is ripping the money out of the institution. </PARA>

As I said, we are talking about the quality of life&mdash;the advances to life that can come out of a vigorous and dedicated commitment to science. And Senator Coulter picks that up when he starts talking about science in the public interest, which is something to which we are committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applied science certainly has been an area of weakness in this country. There is no doubt about that. But this government also, by its policies of running down the research infrastructure in universities, needs some $120-odd million a year to bring it back to where it was.

The minister says that there are no morale problems; no management problems; scientists are not under pressures to chase dollars instead of undertaking research; and CSIRO is not at risk of abandoning public interest research in pursuit of short-term research. The way the minister talks one would think everything was a bed of roses at CSIRO. I can assure the minister that it is not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have even heard a rumour that the minister regrets saying that there was no need for a Senate inquiry and that he privately agrees with a lot of the findings in the report which was, after all, a unanimous report from Liberal, Democrat and Labor senators. But, having criticised the inquiry so fiercely, he cannot now support it. Instead, he is stuck, like a shag on a rock, saying that all is well with the science research organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the minister's realisation that he was wrong about CSIRO explains why he was so aggressive, ill-mannered and petulant at last Thursday's hearing. It is not often that I wish there were cameras at estimates hearings, but I wish we could have had them last Thursday night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to comment on a statement that Senator Cook tabled at that estimates hearing. The minister states that it is wrong for non-government senators to talk about a $60 million cut to CSIRO's funding because, trotting out the old argument, he says that the $60 million was one-off funding which CSIRO always knew would come to an end. What a pity the minister did not mention the fact that, in the years prior to 1989, the Labor government ripped the guts out of science funding and it was only when the scientists protested long and hard that something was done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former minister for science, the member for Lalor, Mr Barry Jones, convinced the government to have a change of heart, and in 1989 the science statement effectively restored the $60 million to that funding. Senator Cook is conveniently ignoring what happened pre-1989, but the opposition will not buy that. The minister stated that 25 per cent of the top 10 per cent of tertiary students are enrolled in science courses. There is no doubt that we have very bright students enrolling for science degrees who go on to work in CSIRO. But the minister is ignoring other vital information. The fact is that only 25 per cent of students enrolling are from the top 25 per cent and 25 per cent are from the bottom, as Senator Coulter has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has done nothing to address this problem. The government has taken no action to make careers in science more attractive to students and we, as a country, will have to suffer as a result. The consequences of Minister Cook's actions will be the decline of Australia's reputation in world class science and there is no point in blaming anybody else.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue before us is the central issue of support for basic science. Basic science is that part of science that is done to find out how the world works without a clear application in mind. It asks questions such as: how gravity works; how matter is structured; what causes cell differentiation; what is the significance of yellow-green algae in the ecology? None of these questions have obvious commercial application; many have few obvious implications for any application. That does not mean that they have no application or that they are not important or even crucial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basic science laid the groundwork for all our existing technology. Most did not start out with obvious implications. Who would think that research into the ecology of sea urchins would be basic to saving the kelp industry, which in turn is basic to the processed food industry providing many substances like algin laminaran? Who would have expected the role that research into seaweed has in biotechnology and therefore in modern agriculture and pharmaceuticals? Who would have thought that research into the changes in electrical properties of clay due to impurities would result in the electronics revolution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing about knowledge is that you cannot tell what it will be good for before you have done it. The implications for basic research only become clear once you have done it. If we have any pretence to being a clever country we must have basic research. The areas of commercially productive application are obvious to most scientists, especially if they are obvious enough to convince bureaucrats. Every nation has identified them and is working on them. The areas where real jumps will be made are the areas where applications are not obvious because no one is looking. The people who do the basic work are liable to be the first people to see the hidden implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO funding is mostly funding for application. Corporate research is all about application. The only sphere for basic research is universities. The push for greater self-funding and corporate funding of university research means that universities do more and more applied research and less and less basic research. It means simply that the success of research is increasingly measured by its immediate economic return. As this becomes a measure by which research is judged and funds become available, less and less basic research will be done. Universities become the research arms of industry, and commercial research players in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free scientific information has always been the basis upon which science is done. Science is produced for all of humanity, available to everyone, especially colleagues who work in the field. Science is a communal activity and the sharing of ideas and information is central to the advance of our common understanding, undertaken ultimately for our common good. The reward of a scientist has always been recognition by her or his peers rather than monetary gain. The push for patenting undermines that and works against the common good.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition welcomes this motion by Senator Coulter. We support his view that this ALP government has failed to recognise the importance of science and the need for the government to fund the research effort properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be no need for this motion today. The Labor government has been warned continually about the perilous state of research and research infrastructure in this country. We have warned that Australia is spending only 1.35 per cent of its GDP on research and development and that this compares very poorly with other OECD countries and has compared poorly over the 12-year term of this government. Pro rata, we spend less than half the money that Japan, Sweden and Germany spend on R&amp;D. They are leaders in this field and we are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is failing to get the private sector to spend on collaborative research in the way that other countries are. Many multinational companies trading in Australia do their research overseas. If we want the research done here and the results to benefit the Australian people, the government must contribute a higher proportion to the collaborative research projects with private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts that the federal government's role is to support research and research infrastructure. This needs to be a top priority because of the poor state that science in this country is in by world standards. Indications are that this poor standard is set to worsen. The relative science study citation published by Professor Bourke and others at the ANU shows that since 1987-88&mdash;which, people will recall, was the start of the so-called Dawkins revolution&mdash;the quality of science published by Australian researchers has fallen dramatically. According to the science citation index, the fall has been eight per cent. At a time when the index should be rising in a country like ours, it is actually falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality and the amount of research is going downhill fast. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 June quotes Professor Bourke and Linda Butler, this time on a new survey of international research links by Australian institutions, as saying that the evidence shows that the research effort in Australian universities is clumped in fewer than a third of the nation's 37 universities. Further, of that third, 85 per cent of the total research effort is undertaken by a handful of established older universities. At present the quality of science and research is dependent on people in their 50s and 60s who will be retiring in the next 10 or 15 years. This quality is not being replaced by young, able students; they are simply shying away from science research because the money and resulting research support infrastructure is not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very sad record for a government that began 12 years ago with such hope in this area. It initially appointed a minister who knew something about the field. He had written a book on it, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sleepers, Wake!</EMPHASIS>, which was about the great need for improvement in spending on science in this country. At the time, many of us thought that with such a minister such a low priority on R&amp;D would change. Indeed, that minister, Barry Jones, had a vision. His vision was 18 to 20 years ahead; unfortunately, he was in a cabinet which had a vision that was only 18 to 20 months ahead&mdash;the next election, which was all it was concerned about. It could not see how spending money for long-term benefit could improve the situation for the government at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve years down the track the stark outcome of this lack of foresight and lack of spending is very evident. Currently, exports of scientific and medical equipment earn $782 million. That sounds pretty impressive until we discover that we are importing equipment to the value of $2.8 billion. That represents a deficit in spending in that area of over $2 billion. That is a result of the lack of foresight, lack of vision and lack of support from government for research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had a poor record over the last 12 years, this government, with this current budget, shows a continuation of that pattern. What does it do in this budget for the premier research bodies? CSIRO drops 13 per cent in real terms. ANSTO drops five per cent. The Australian Institute of Marine Science drops three per cent. What forward planning and vision that is! A cost benefit study shows that research pays for itself over and over again but this short-sighted government does not see that. It sees it as more important to produce a bottom line budget that shows we are in surplus, even when that is done by the dodgy means of including the foreshadowed sale of the rest of the Commonwealth Bank. It is so concerned with getting a positive outcome in the budget that it has wrecked things that are important to our long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has happened not only with the bodies I have mentioned but with our major universities, where funding for important research grants, such as ARC grants, is at a point where, when the success rate used to be 20 per cent, it is now 16 per cent. The facilities at our universities are deteriorating as the government fails to provide the spending on infrastructure that is needed. From this point on we must see that science is important to growth and expansion. We must fund government bodies and cooperative efforts with industry in an appropriate way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am curious as to why Senator Coulter has sought to have this matter addressed as a matter of urgency. Much of what Senator Coulter said tonight he has said before. In fact, he said it on 21 September last year. The answer to why Senator Coulter has brought this matter before the Senate this evening can be found in an article by Simon Grose in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 16 May 1995, headed `Out in the cold with Senator John'. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democrat Senator Dr John Coulter is so far outside the power loop he makes Pluto seem close to the Sun. When the only politician in your orbit is John Coulter you've got problems.</PARA>
<PARA>This article was about the post-budget national science forum held at CSIRO's Limestone Avenue office. Professor Johnston, of the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, FASTS, who attended the conference, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . superannuation funds should invest 5 per cent of their funds as "patient venture capital". Senator Coulter proposes such ideas and they have simplistic appeal.</PARA>
<PARA>The author of the article further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If science won a designated share of such funds the Government knows that environmentalists, the transport industry, agriculture, Aborigines, and others would soon seek a slice of the new precedent. And in such schemes accountants would find loopholes and let lazy money abuse the taxpayers' trust.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the real reason Senator Coulter has proposed this urgency motion. Since the opposition has stood up to support Senator Coulter's proposal, I will quote from what we at least know to be Liberal Party policy. We have nothing else other than the creative innovative culture statement of March 1993, page 7 of which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of government is therefore, first and foremost, a strategic one: to ensure policies across the range of portfolio areas are integrated to provide the optimal framework to encourage and facilitate research and development. In present circumstances there is a significant role for government in removing the impediments to research and development which are inherent in present policy settings.</PARA>
<PARA>The culture statement makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government can also have an "educative" role, through such mechanisms as the taxation concession for research and development, in speeding the adjustment from a traditional and "make-do" culture to an innovative and outward looking culture.</PARA>
<PARA>If there is any evidence that the government has not done that, let them put it on the table. We certainly have achieved those objectives. The statement further reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, where private benefits are likely to be substantial, the role of government is not to invest taxpayer resources but to ensure that impediments to sensible private decision-making are removed.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the government has achieved that. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the balance between government-funded and privately funded research and development, especially so in improving the latter in Australia's case.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has been working to do that also. I would suggest that, in the programs this government has implemented, we have achieved those things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has already taken up much of the Senate's time. Senator Chamarette has actively pursued the same subject matter for most of last week and previously in the estimates hearing of 26 May 1995. The senator clearly continues to believe that some secret deal has occurred between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), ATSIC and other parties. The fact that no deal did occur and the fact that the senator has no evidence of such a deal has not stopped her, with the support of those opposite, from wasting the time of this place and from continuing to make unfounded accusations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me again make it very clear that the Prime Minister gave no undertaking or made any decision in respect of how much ATSIC should set aside for land acquisition in the Northern Territory. The ATSIC board made its own decision on how it would allocate its funds. In many ways this tabling motion is a farce. It is clear from her own admissions that Senator Chamarette has already obtained a copy of a number of  documents which should have been treated with confidence. She would therefore be well aware that there was no secret deal or any secret agreement. Certainly, those papers did refer to discussions with the government and to negotiations. These discussions did not embrace financial allocations but referred to parallel programs and limitations of the ILC land purchases being claimable under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. There is nothing sinister or secret in those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette and those opposite would have us believe that ATSIC's recent decision to set aside $10 million in each of the next two years for land acquisition in the Northern Territory was the child of this so-called secret deal. I am advised that considerable discussion took place at the board meeting with particular debate on whether funds should be set aside for the Northern Territory and, if so, the level of those funds. This level of discussion and debate within an independent board, which occurred, is inconsistent with Senator Chamarette's hypothesis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the ATSIC board was concerned that under section 191U of the legislation establishing the ILC, any land purchased through the ILC funding cannot be claimed under the Northern Territory land rights act. This means that Aboriginal groups wishing to acquire land and subsequently claim such land for conversion to inalienable freehold title under the Northern Territory legislation can only do so if the necessary funding support for the acquisition is not provided by the ILC. Therefore, until 1997, which is the sunset time for claims under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, ATSIC will be positioned to continue to provide funding for acquisition in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the illogical nature of the arguments put forward over the last week, the government acknowledges that Senator Chamarette has obtained numerical support for her motion. Therefore, the government has agreed to table a range of documents. Additionally, I put on the public record for those opposite that their support for Senator Chamarette's motion will result in the tabling of a number of documents which will breach confidences understood by various parties during negotiations on the ILC and the ILF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put on the public record that those opposite clearly do not recognise or accept the principle that consultation processes leading to policy development are normally a matter of confidence between the various parties. Many of the documents contain material in the nature of giving or receiving of opinion, advice and recommendations, which are a fundamental part of the deliberative process of both ATSIC and the government. Additionally, the public disclosure of the views of individuals and groups put to ATSIC and government on a confidential basis may well impair the negotiating effectiveness of the commission and governments in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that those opposite are willing to put all of that at risk and to establish a standard for which they themselves will be judged should they ever come to government. What is all the more disappointing is that they are prepared to put all that at risk because Senator Chamarette has a false suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As forecast yesterday, it is not proposed to table certain categories of documents. In particular, documents have been excluded which canvass matters before cabinet or which disclose any deliberation or decision of cabinet. In any event, none of the excluded documents reveal any discussions of a deal of the kind alleged by Senator Chamarette. Normally the government would not release legal advice provided to it by its solicitors on the ground of legal professional privilege. However, due to the gravity of the allegations made by the senator, the privilege in this instance is waived. The basis on which documents are being withheld is consistent with official guidelines and consistent with the government's general position in respect of such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having participated in this debate&mdash;coincidentally, I have been in the chamber over the last couple of days when debate has occurred on this matter&mdash;I apologise to the Senate for inadvertently misleading it and believing that we have done 15 minutes of government business in the last six days. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not be spending a great deal of time taking note of this Auditor-General's report. I felt it is necessary because members of this Senate would know that I am usually the last person to stand up and congratulate the Department of Defence. I have been very concerned about levels of expenditure and accountability and policies and programs. However, I felt it is only fair that in areas where Defence is doing the right thing that I also do the right thing and acknowledge that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first part of this report&mdash;the project audit on energy management in Defence&mdash;the Auditor-General's office has made a fairly critical assessment of the way Defence has undertaken its obligations in relation to energy saving across departments. It is critical; it is not 100 per cent positive. But Defence has started that program. It is not something I can say about many other departments. The important thing also is that Defence has implemented or taken steps to implement the majority of the recommendations in the audit report. This seems to coincide with the information that I received on asking questions of Defence during the recent estimates hearings about its defence housing program. In relation to housing and regional development, I had already asked about the entire government's housing program and its efforts to implement energy standards within its program and was given very short shift in saying, `We don't know if we can do this. It might cost more money. We really don't want to be prescriptive on the environment.' For people who know, most of this can be regarded as nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 5 June 1995 entitled `Govt fails to switch on to energy savings'. This article says that the government is actually delaying saving money. Everyone should be able to understand that. The first paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Millions of dollars of public money is being wasted every year because the Federal Government has largely failed to implement a promise made three years ago by the Prime Minister to cut energy use in its buildings.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one example&mdash;the Bureau of Statistics' Cameron Offices, one of Canberra's biggest office complexes&mdash;a review in July 1993 found the building used 29 per cent more energy than was typical for a building of its size.</PARA>
<PARA>An energy audit was done and only now, more than two years later, is the recommended system being installed. So we are actually delaying saving money. There have been energy consultants involved in a number of energy audits but they remain frustrated because the targets identified in energy audits costing $1 million remain unachieved in many departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a recent estimates committee hearing I asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) why performance is so poor in the area of integrating such things as energy goals or greenhouse goals into other departments. He said that it was not the role of Canberra to be involved with demand management. I reminded him that demand management was one of the responsibilities of his department. He changed the wording after that. He realised that perhaps he had said something pretty silly. In fact, we have this role. We could be doing it. Government could be leading the way instead of dragging its feet and costing the taxpayers money every time it delays implementing its own policies of demand management in its own facilities. So, well done, Defence for starting. If you can do it, so can everybody else. Let us see all the other departments getting on board. It is about time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome Auditor-General's report No. 29 that has just been tabled in the Senate. Senator Margetts has very ably covered the first part of the report. I think praise is due to Defence, not only in the energy management field, but also in the environmental field where, for many, many years, long before environmental concerns became fashionable, Defence took a long-sighted view and recognised its responsibilities in maintaining training areas in land that it had around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The point should be made that there are limited opportunities for energy savings within Defence. Certainly with respect to the purchase of new equipment and the design of buildings, those are matters that can be dealt with at the outset, but military platforms per se are designed for specific performance and fuel efficiency and energy efficiency are not the prime concerns. The other problem that the department has is that there is not much predictability from year to year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to move to the second audit, which is on the ANZAC ship program. That is a very brief and superficial look; the longest report is the first one. The report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Preliminary study: ANZAC ship project contract amendments</EMPHASIS>. Paragraph 1.2 on page 31 of report No. 29 contains an extraordinary statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence has estimated that the ten ships will now cost $5837 million in current (December 1994) prices, an increase of $1471 million over the base price established during April 1988. Of this amount, $1294 million is for price increases and exchange rate variations related to the prime contract with Transfield. The remaining $177 million relates to real increases associated with the larger gun, New Zealand spares, currency swap adjustments and a reallocation of travel funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Most of the report deals with that minor amount of a few hundred million dollars, and ignores the increase of $1,471 million, which is a huge increase&mdash;33 per cent-plus&mdash;in the contract price. The government and Transfield go around boasting about how we have got a fixed price contract for the ships, yet here we have the first evidence presented in public, that I know of, of an increase in real terms&mdash;because the taxpayer has to pay for this&mdash;of 33 per cent in the cost of a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the history of this Anzac frigate program, we see that there were two contenders in it: a very good Dutch design, and the Blohm &amp; Voss Meko design which was accepted. The price differential, when the contract was accepted and we were told that the contract was awarded purely on price, was minuscule&mdash;I think it was about $5 million or $10 million per ship. That was the difference. I said at the time that would be eroded through the life of the contract, and so it has come to pass. We have got this increase of $1,471 million, about 33 1/3 per cent, giving us a figure of around $600 million for each of the ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the government announced that there was going to be a major increase in the number of weapons sensors and weapons on the Anzacs. This is because the ships, as they were contracted for, are absolutely vulnerable. Again, the government was told that at the time. The philosophy that the government adopted was that the ships would be designed for, but not fitted with, what are really essential weapons sensors and armaments and the electronic command and control systems to integrate those, which systems are essential for the survival of the ship in a hostile environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ship that was bought because it was cheaper than a better competitor has now blown out to $600 million, and it may well be on the way to requiring another $100 million to be spent on it. Even if we take the figure of $600 million, and given the fact that defence resources are so short and will never be adequate for our needs, you have really got to question what we could have done with $600 million for one ship and consider the defence capability that we could have bought in other areas. For $600 million, we could have bought a great deal more flexibility; we could have bought something that was far more potent; and we could have bought something that was far more survivable than an Anzac ship. Putting that in contrast, we could have bought a squadron of F18 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the roles of ships and aircraft are not the same, the effectiveness of alternative weapons systems&mdash;which is the way you have got to consider it in today's modern warfare&mdash;has to be considered when you have got limited resources. The Anzac ship program is very expensive, with limited defence capabilities for us. I am very disappointed that the Auditor-General chose not to explore this rate increase of one-third in the contract price and moved on to what was really the minor part&mdash;the increase in armament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final part of the Auditor-General's report deals with overseas visits by Defence officers. It makes the point that, in the last financial year, 1,746 Department of Defence officers travelled overseas for a cost of $15.8 million. Most of the people in this parliament do travel overseas, but that average is a figure of $9,000 per trip. I would think that is a very high figure for what is probably an average of about a 10- or 14-day visit overseas. I would have thought that we could have got better value for money and shaved some thousands of dollars off that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not expect the officers of the Public Service to stay in the equivalent of Salvation Army hostels or anything like that. I think a reasonable standard of accommodation and reasonable food is what they are due. But I think all that could have been met for an average figure considerably below $9,000 a visit. The Auditor-General does not comment on that point, but on page 41 of the report he makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's documentation cites a longstanding government requirement that only those overseas visits that are strictly essential to the requirements of specific work programs necessary for the conduct of Government business should proceed. In practice, however, this appears not to be the criterion, with some visits approved as desirable rather than essential.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Auditor-General is saying to Defence: `You are not conforming to the government guidelines which apply to all departments, not only Defence, and business overseas should be crucial to the program that it is related to and should not be taken on the basis of being desirable only.' Clearly, in the view of the Auditor-General, Defence has broken those guidelines and not observed the rule that visits have to be strictly necessary. I would be very surprised if all government departments were not similarly breaking that rule, and I do not think that Defence ought to be singled out on that. Clearly, where funds are short&mdash;and this applies to all departments&mdash;and when rules are set, they should be obeyed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to mention this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 29</EMPHASIS> into various aspects of the Department of Defence. In particular, I express a little concern that the Auditor-General has decided not to proceed to a full audit of some of the matters raised. For example, in the Anzac ship matter, which Senator MacGibbon has just dealt with, the Auditor-General, on page 32, paragraph 1.8, concludes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other contract amendments have had no significant cost impact on the project. In the circumstances the ANAO decided that there was no need to proceed with a full performance audit of contract amendment procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice also that, as a result of a study, the audit office decided not to proceed with a full audit of the procedures of overseas visits by Defence officers. The other matter which is included in this report, and which has nothing to do with defence, is the national landcare program. The audit office decided not to proceed with an audit of this and decided that further audit coverage should be deferred to enable implementation of provisions of a new arrangement between the Commonwealth and states. I do hope that it is not a shortage of funds that is prompting the audit office not to proceed with those audits. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator MacGibbon says, maybe the audit office is so busy paying such a large amount of rent to the Labor Party for its new building that it has not got any money left over. I do hope that these decisions are based entirely on audit criteria rather than on shortage of funds, although there is no doubt, from what the previous Auditor-General particularly has been saying so publicly, that the government does appear to have been squeezing the Auditor-General for money, clearly not liking the sort of supervision of government spending that the Auditor-General's office, particularly under the previous Auditor-General, has been implementing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the role of the Auditor-General is absolutely crucial to effective management of the enormous volumes of government spending which are financed by taxpayers. Just as the government has shown an extraordinary reluctance to finance the activities of the Auditor-General, and a great enthusiasm to limit its powers, so the government has similarly tried to restrict the capacity of Senate committees to examine the expenditures of the government. In the latest budget figures, there has been an extraordinary cut in the expenses available to Senate committees to perform this kind of similar audit function&mdash;to examine the expenditure of government departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no doubt that the audit that the Auditor-General has conducted in these specific matters is of some benefit, although I must say that I share Senator MacGibbon's concern about the substantial increase in the Anzac frigate program. What is evident here is that the first ship, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS>, is scheduled for delivery on 29 March 1996, and the other nine are to follow it at almost yearly intervals until 2005. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what further cost rises may well take place. As Senator MacGibbon said, although Defence has now estimated that the 10 ships will cost $5,837 million in December 1994 prices, there is clearly some risk that by the time the last one is delivered in the year 2005&mdash;in 10 years time&mdash;there will be considerable further cost increases, hopefully not in real terms. This is the real problem. If there are increases after we take inflation into account, then we have serious problems. It is of some concern that the $1.47 billion increase Senator MacGibbon noted had been built up since the April 1988 basic price. I note that the Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of this amount, $1294 million is for price increases and exchange rate variations related to the prime contract with Transfield. The remaining $177 million relates to real increases associated with the larger gun, New Zealand spares, currency swap adjustments and a re-allocation of travel funds.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something like a 30 per cent increase. However, the Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There had been some 600 contract amendments to the prime contract at the time of audit. The Project Office has a set of business rules with Transfield that have restricted real . . . cost increases on the prime contract, to costs associated with the Torpedo Decoy System upgrade and the purchase of additional spares.</PARA>
<PARA>The report points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes represent real cost increases to the prime contract of approximately $16.6 million at April 1988 prices and exchange rates. This relatively small increase has been funded from the Project's contingency fund.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I must say that it seems hard to go from that conclusion to the one the Auditor-General next comes to&mdash;that is, that `there was no need to proceed with a full performance audit of contract amendment procedures' because clearly there have been very significant rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal very briefly with the question of overseas visits. As Senator MacGibbon pointed out, an average cost of $9,000 for overseas visits by Defence personnel does seem fairly large when visits to nearby countries&mdash;which one would expect would involve minimal expenditure in terms of travel cost, such as to Papua New Guinea or New Zealand&mdash;are included now in this total. It is curious that at some stage they were not. There was confusion about whether they should be included. This is a matter that the Auditor-General has brought to the attention of the parliament, because there seemed to be different criteria used by different sections of Defence about what constituted an overseas visit. The audit office states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the difficulty and inconsistencies encountered by the ANAO in collating basic data about overseas visits, and forthcoming changes in overseas visit procedures, the preliminary study did not proceed to a performance audit.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that would have underlined the need for some kind of performance audit. In any event, the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the inconsistencies in data collection, associated with devolution of responsibilities to the eight programs, indicated the need for the Department's Management Audit Branch to undertake another compliance audit to check that the new instruction on overseas travel, when introduced, is being complied with consistently.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the main points raised in this matter; although, as I said, I do hope that in these matters and with the national landcare program the audit office's decision not to proceed with detailed audits certainly is based on auditing criteria and not on the shortage of funds. The government continually appears determined to squeeze the audit office for money. </PARA>

Some honourable senators in the chamber will recall that I directed a very similar question on this particular issue to Senator Faulkner, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was one of Mr Keating's great big promises in the 1992 environment statement. The government had committed itself to reducing energy consumption in Commonwealth occupied buildings. A reduction of 15 per cent within five years and 25 per cent within 10 years was yet another one of those Keating promises made some three years ago. I asked Senator Faulkner whether he could provide some information on how the government was working towards achieving this goal. Of course, Senator Faulkner ran and ducked for cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Dee Margetts pointed out to the chamber, it is pleasing to read the seriousness with which at least one department&mdash;the Department of Defence&mdash;is approaching this program and the efforts that it has made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a report which points to some problems which may have emerged in the department's efforts to implement the policy, but it is clear that a serious effort has been made. It is good to see departments making serious efforts. It would be even more delightful if ministers could make serious attempts to answer serious questions so that the Senate could be better informed on how all these particular departments are doing. It raises the interesting issue that there is still some discussion over the appropriate baseline figure. The promise of Mr Keating depended on a baseline figure of 1992-93 and there is some discussion in this report on how you calculate that baseline figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worrying that, some three years down the track, we still do not know. I do not know whether this is the case or not. All I know is that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) refused to answer the question, or could not or would not answer the question. We do not really know whether the baseline figures have been agreed for most departments. It comes as a shock, three years down the track, to see that this may not have occurred in some departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> suggests that that is the case. It is most interesting to read this report and to note the seriousness with which the Department of Defence has approached trying to achieve the goals that are set out in this important program to conserve energy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends Defence legislation for the following purposes: to enable senior acting appointments to be made at ministerial level rather than by the Governor-General; to replace provisions under which officers hold their appointments at the Governor-General's pleasure; to implement recommendations of the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review; to extend the home loan assistance application deadline for a limited group of former members; and to ensure that the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme complies with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The bill also amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to fill a gap in the entitlement to compensation for the unintended consequences of medical treatment provided at Commonwealth expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will deal with these matters in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment will enable the appointment of officers to act as the Chief of the Defence Force, Vice Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force to be made by a minister rather than the Governor-General. This will streamline the procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden from the Governor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second group of amendments concerns retirement and termination of appointments. At present, the Defence Act, Naval Defence Act and Air Force Regulations provide that officers hold their appointment at the Governor-General's pleasure. Under the existing provisions, officers could be retired or have their appointments terminated at any time and on any grounds or for no grounds at all. The Defence Force is the last major Commonwealth career group subject to the concept of holding office at pleasure. This concept is no longer appropriate to a career service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act replace the current blanket provisions with provisions that specify the grounds on which an officer can be retired early or have an appointment terminated. The amendments also introduce specific procedures for the management initiated early retirement of officers, and enable the promotion of senior officers on limited tenure where they accept a promotion on that condition. Corresponding amendments will be made to the Air Force Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these amendments will give the Defence Organisation management flexibility, they also increase the level of protection available to affected officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed provisions an officer could only be retired early or have an appointment terminated where one of the specified grounds is made out, or where the officer is subject to the management initiated early retirement procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where appropriate, an officer to be retired early or have an appointment terminated would be given the reasons in writing for the proposed action and an opportunity to show cause why it should not proceed. The main exception would be where the period of fixed term appointment had expired (often referred to as Short Service Commissions). Affected officers would also have the right to lodge an application for redress of grievance under the Defence Force Regulations and are entitled to submit a complaint to the Defence Force Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar safeguards apply to the management initiated early retirement procedures. In addition, I would emphasise that management initiated early retirement would only occur after all attempts to redeploy or retrain an affected officer had been exhausted and would be accompanied by the offer of a financial package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third group of amendments is to the Defence Force Discipline Act, which provides a scheme of discipline for all members of the Defence Force. When the legislation came into operation, provision was made for a Board of Review to review its operation after three years. The Board found that the scheme was generally adequate but made a number of recommendations to enhance its operation. The proposed amendments to the act would achieve this and also bring the act into line with Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions for the investigation of offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the key amendments are those which enable the appointment of discipline officers to deal with minor infringements of discipline. The Board found that the present procedures for dealing with minor infractions are unnecessarily complex and administratively burdensome. A discipline officer will have the power to decide, with a minimum of formality, matters which do not have any element of criminality and to impose minor punishments. These will not carry the stigma of a criminal conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should emphasise that a discipline officer will only be able to deal with uncontested matters and a person who wishes to defend a matter will have the right to a full hearing under the ordinary provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act. Where an accused person does wish to have a case handled by a discipline officer, there will be no entitlement to representation but the right to call evidence in mitigation of punishment will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three new offences are created: unlawful discharge of a weapon; and refusal to submit to a medical examination, or supply a specimen, where a medical examination is being carried out as part of the investigation of a service offence. The latter offences will assist the prosecution of offences involving drug abuse. The Defence Force has in place a firm `no drugs' policy and the maximum penalty for use and possession of cannabis is to be increased from a fine equivalent to seven days pay to a fine of fourteen days pay for a first offence and dismissal from the Defence Force for a subsequent offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sentencing options for minor offences will be enhanced by introducing the punishment of extra drill (to a maximum of 3 hours spread over 3 days), increasing the maximum period of extra duties (from 3 to 7 days) and enabling suspension of the payment of all fines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, members of the Defence Force who are suspended from duty pending the investigation of an alleged offence or suspended while awaiting trial for a civil or criminal offence are entitled to payment of salary and allowances. This entitlement will be removed where a suspended member has been charged with an offence. Such a member will, however, be entitled to engage in employment outside the Defence Force during the period of suspension. These changes will parallel the provisions applying to the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act will streamline existing procedures for the conduct of investigations and hearings conducted by service tribunals, and bring certain provisions in the act, such as those dealing with confessions, into line with current Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth amendment is to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act to overcome a defect in the administration of the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, the act was amended to provide access to the Home Loans Assistance Scheme to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force after 14 May 1985 and were discharged because of a compensable disability before 15 May 1991, provided these persons applied for an entitlement certificate by 1 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the changes to the act were publicised widely through Service and ex-Service channels at the time, it was nevertheless considered that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to attempt to contact every former member who might benefit and who might otherwise not become aware of the benefit. Unfortunately, some former members received late advice of the changes. As a result, some 17 applicants were debarred because the cut-off date of 1 September 1994 for lodging applications had already passed. Accordingly, the bill extends the time limit from 1 September to 1 December 1994 so that these persons will not be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fifth group of amendments is to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act. This act establishes the current superannuation scheme for members of the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will allow the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) legislation, which provides for enhanced prudential supervision of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are of a technical nature and relate to the decision making powers and roles of the Board of Trustees and the Minister. They are similar to amendments made last year to the superannuation legislation relating to the Commonwealth civilian schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) legislation requires, among other things, that trustees of superannuation entities not be subject to direction by any person and that the approval of the trustees must be obtained for any change to the governing rules of the scheme. In the case of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme the governing rules would include the Trust Deed and Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments remove the present requirement for the Trustees to have regard to statements of Government policy in exercising their functions, provide that financial statements be in a form agreed between the Board of Trustees and the Minister, and require the agreement of the Board of Trustees to any changes to the Trust Deed or Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final amendment made by the bill is to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. In 1994 various amendments were made to that act in association with introduction of the Military Compensation Scheme. One amendment provided an entitlement for compensation for an injury that arises from medical treatment provided at Commonwealth expense where the injury is an unintended consequence of the treatment. Defence Force service (or specified Defence-related service) attracts the entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An unintentional effect of the amendment was that it did not cover the period between the enactment of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988 and introduction of the Military Compensation Scheme in 1994 (although the entitlement in question applied under the legislation that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act replaced). The proposed amendment fills the gap so there is no period of service for which the entitlement does not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will appreciate from my comments on the individual measures that this legislation is essentially part of the ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force. With this in mind, I look forward to the Senate's support for the legislation. The estimated cost of the amendment to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act is approximately $1 million although there will be considerable offsets in the avoidance of litigation. The other amendments are not expected to have a significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends four acts dealing with superannuation for Commonwealth sector civilian employees, the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1994. It also removes gender-specific terms from the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the bill is to make amendments to continue the process of ensuring that the two superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees  comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and regulations under that act (SIS). I expect the Boards of Trustees of the two schemes to elect that the schemes become regulated superannuation funds under SIS with effect from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make some technical amendments to the acts to name the schemes, the Boards of Trustees and the Funds as the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the CSS and PSS Boards and the CSS and PSS Funds. This will ensure that the generally used names have a legal basis and will enable ease of reference in other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity has also been taken to include amendments to correct anomalies that have arisen and caused inequities. For example, to provide restoration of an invalidity pension that had been cancelled on a return to work that is terminated in the probationary period because of ill-health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes amendments to restore the original intentions of the 1976 act as a response to the changing employment conditions in the public sector. For example the change to the definition of minimum retiring age in that act formally  recognises that most members of the scheme are able to retire from age 55.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also included are some amendments to assist administrative efficiency, for example, the Boards will be able to rely on advice from employers rather than have to check personnel records for over 200,000 members. These amendments will not prevent the Boards from correcting errors in such information nor interfere with members' appeal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes several technical amendments and drafting corrections resulting from previous amendments and to remove gender-specific terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. The amendments to correct anomalies will increase the cost of the schemes slightly;  most of the provisions designed to assist administration efficiency will decrease administrative costs or prevent increases in such costs;  and a further administrative amendment will reduce the cost of the CSS but not the overall cost to the Commonwealth as there will be an offsetting compensation cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the anomalies occur only in unusual situations, it is likely that there would be no overall cost to the schemes or the Commonwealth from the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian International School, registered with the Hong Kong Education Department, opened in February 1995. The school was set up in response to growing demand by Australians based in Hong Kong for schooling for their children in the face of insufficient places in the Hong Kong English school system. The Australian Consulate-General has been active in supporting efforts to create a community, non-profit school. It was involved in meetings with Australian community organisations in Hong Kong to consider proposals put forward to establish an Australian school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, in his capacity as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, wrote on 20 January 1995 to the Governor of Hong Kong, The Rt Hon Christopher Patten, asking him to consider allocation of a permanent site for the school.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early liaison with the Hong Kong Government was carried out to establish the school as a community-based non-profit international school.
