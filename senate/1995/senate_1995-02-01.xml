<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES (COMPENSATION) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current legislation, people who receive compensation for an injury should reimburse the Commonwealth for medicare and nursing home benefits which they have received in respect of that injury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the review of the relationship between compensation and health and community services programs found that many people receiving compensation designed to meet the full cost of injury-related medical and other care needs do not reimburse the Commonwealth. They `double dip' by receiving free or heavily subsidised services funded by the Commonwealth, as well as compensation for the full costs of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Double dipping can never be acceptable, because it means that the community pays twice for a service&mdash;once through insurance and again through Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current policy to prevent double dipping is not able to be implemented properly because of flaws in the legislation. According to the work of the review, it appears to be widely circumvented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This main compensation bill and its cognate Bills seek to address the problems with the existing legislation and ensure that the Commonwealth is reimbursed the equivalent of benefits that have been paid, as current policy requires. It is important to stop double dipping because it diverts limited resources away from injured people who have no alternative source of assistance apart from Commonwealth programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will improve systems to identify compensation claimants and recipients, and to recover benefits paid prior to an award of compensation. The benefits covered by the Bills are medicare benefits, provided under the Health Insurance Act 1973, and nursing home benefits, provided under the National Health Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions will ensure that compensation claimants and recipients, insurers, and compensation payers are aware of their liabilities to the Commonwealth, where medicare benefits and/or nursing home benefits have been paid to claimants before their compensation is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills are particularly targeted at lump sum compensation payments. Double dipping is generally not a problem under periodic payment schemes because expenses are reimbursed as they are incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Identification of people who receive compensation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that approximately 73,000 compensation cases are finalised each year, with many more than that number ongoing at any one time. To improve the identification of these cases, the main bill requires insurers and compensation payers to notify the Health Insurance Commission of details of claims lodged for compensation. They must also notify the Commission of key events in their progress and of their finalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While seeking to improve identification of compensation claimants and recipients, the new arrangements protect individuals' private information relating to their treatment histories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Benefits Paid Prior to Compensation Becoming Payable</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare and nursing home benefits paid to or in respect of a person because of their compensable injury up until compensation is payable will be recovered from the compensation payment. Where the amount of compensation is reduced because of contributory negligence, the amount of benefits to be recovered will be determined on the basis of the reduced compensation award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation claimants will be required to identify all services received in respect of the compensable injury prior to the compensation case being finalised. Insurers and compensation payers will then be notified by the Health Insurance Commission of the amount to be reimbursed to the Commonwealth. This will be done prior to the compensation amount being determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the debt will be the compensable person's, insurers or compensation payers will be liable to the Commonwealth for payment of the amount claimed from the compensation. Payment will be made by the insurer or compensation payer at the time compensation becomes payable. Given these arrangements, no appeals process against recoveries for past benefits is necessary because the claimant identifies the services in respect of the compensable injury and for which benefits have been paid. Claimants can then ensure that the amount to be paid to the Commonwealth is reflected in the terms of the compensation payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Administration Fee</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration Fee Bill 1994 is being introduced with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration Fee Bill introduces a fee which will be charged to insurers or compensation payers where an amount of compensation has become payable.The fee will cover ongoing running costs of the new provisions, making the recovery process self-funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a two-tiered fee system. A $150 fee will apply to cases which are finalised within five years or less of the date of the accident and a $300 fee will apply to cases  finalised more than five years after that date. The higher fee for older cases reflects the higher cost associated with information storage and retrieval. It is envisaged that the higher fee for these cases may also encourage quicker resolution of compensation cases which would generally be to the advantage of the compensation claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some consequential amendments are required to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. For example, an amendment is required to include administration of these bills as a function of the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments are also required to the current provisions aimed at preventing double dipping in medicare and nursing home benefits; that is, to section 18 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and section 59 of the National Health Act 1953, respectively, to reflect the new provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Savings each year from these measures are estimated to be around $40 million. Costs will be approximately $9.4m in 1994-95 and subsequent years. Running costs will be fully offset by the administration fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative changes to prevent double dipping in relation to the cost of medical services are of great importance to the Government. There can be no doubt that double dipping adds to the cost of Medicare and nursing home benefits. It also creates inequities between people with acquired disabilities who receive compensation and those who do not. The Government is committed to establishing a simple, fair system to ensure that people with disabilities who receive compensation contribute towards the cost of care which they have already received. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES (COMPENSATION) CARE CHARGES BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill accompanies the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994. In effect, it duplicates those provisions of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994 which relate to the recovery of medicare and nursing home benefits which have been paid to a compensable person prior to compensation becoming payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for this duplication arises from the fact that in some circumstances the recovery provisions in the main compensation bill could be construed to be a form of taxation. In case of this interpretation, the provisions must also appear in a separate bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains the amendments announced by the Assistant Treasurer on 6 April 1994. These amendments inject much needed flexibility into the administration of the Scheme and close an emerging loophole where some people were avoiding their child support obligations, again placing responsibility for the financial support of their children onto the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These twin objectives have been achieved by increasing the administrative role of the CSA in some areas, extending the rights of parents to enter into private payment arrangements, ensuring private child support agreements entered into by DSS clients provide adequate levels of child support, and aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those in the Family Law Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumptions of parentage</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill brings the presumptions of parentage in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 into line with the presumptions used in the Family Law Act 1975. Currently, the child support presumptions are limited to those where some documentary evidence exists as a basis for the presumption (for example a child born during marriage). This bill also allows the Registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a child where:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that child was born to a woman married to that man within 10 months after their marriage has been annulled;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that child was born to a woman who was married to that man, separated from him, resumed cohabitation for not more than 3 months and separated again, and that child was born within 10 months after cohabitation ended and after the dissolution of their marriage; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that child was born to a woman who cohabited with that man for a period of at least 6 months and this period included the time 10 months before the birth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those of the Family Law Act will streamline the administrative arrangements in place between the Child Support Agency and the Department of Social Security. Currently, many custodial parents who apply for child support are required to obtain a birth certificate or a statutory declaration from the father. This can take months, and causes needless hardship to children and custodial parents deprived of support during this period. It can also create substantial arrears of child support for the non-custodial parent when the necessary proof is obtained, causing his or her liability to be back-dated to the time the application was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative delays associated with obtaining this paperwork have contributed to significant criticism of the Scheme. This amendment will largely remove this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child Support Agreements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, a study conducted by the Department of Social Security has indicated that 80 per cent of agreements registered with the Child Support Agency are for amounts less than formula assessment. On average, these agreements are for 50 per cent less than formula assessment. This has the effect of transferring responsibility for the financial support of the children to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To remedy this emerging loophole in the interaction between child support and social security legislation, the bill requires the Registrar to accept child support agreements for custodial parents receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance when these agreements meet the Department of Social Security's requirement that the custodial parent take reasonable action to obtain maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parents will remain free to negotiate agreements that contain a mixture of periodic, non-periodic and capitalised maintenance. However, if the custodial parent is receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance the combined value of cash and non-cash components in the agreement must provide adequate levels of child support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-enforcement of certain Stage 1 cases</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the non enforcement of amounts of maintenance payable under a Stage 1 court order or court registered agreement in two circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">firstly, when a non-custodial parent's income from all sources is not more than the maximum rate of single pension and they are in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance&mdash;in practice this will usually be when the non-custodial parent is unemployed or unable to be employed through, for example a serious illness; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, when a child has left the ongoing care of the custodial parent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of a non-custodial parent's income falling below the threshold amount, he or she may apply to the Registrar to not enforce the terms of a court order or court registered agreement. Checks will be undertaken with the Department of Social Security to ensure the non-custodian's income is below this threshold and, if verified, the amounts specified in the order will no longer be collected by the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The non-enforcement period will generally be from the date of the non-custodian's application although the Registrar will have a discretion to back-date the start of this non-enforcement period to the date the person first qualified under this income test. However, the non-enforcement period will not commence earlier than the day on which child support was last collected. This will prevent overpayments of child support being made to custodial parents and the subsequent hardship to children and custodial parents that could occur through recovery of this overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, if a child leaves the ongoing care of a person named in a Stage 1 court order or court registered agreement the Registrar will, where both parents elect, no longer enforce the terms of the order or agreement as they apply to that child. Temporary absences, including normal access time and temporary short term changes to access arrangements will be ignored. Further, a child at boarding school will not be deemed to have left the care of the custodial parent. It is not the intention of this amendment to allow non-custodial parents to obtain `credits' against their liability for each and every day they care for their children. The parents must agree in writing that a substantive change in care has occurred and that it is likely to be ongoing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the court order or court registered agreement will not be changed as a result of this amendment. This amendment merely gives the Registrar the ability to not enforce certain amounts for the periods involved.No debt accrues to the Commonwealth during these periods. It will always remain open to either party to have the order varied or for the custodial parent to enforce amounts in his or her own right. This amendment simply gives the Registrar the ability to not enforce a registered liability for the period involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private collection</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill extends the rights of custodial parents in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance to collect child support privately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newly registered clients receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance may, under the current law, elect at the outset to receive child support payments privately. Large numbers make that election and the Agency only becomes involved in collection for these clients when private arrangements fail. However, once the Agency does become involved in collection for these clients, they are not able to subsequently elect for private collection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will introduce greater freedom for parents to make private arrangements for payment. The choice will be available to custodial parents where the non-custodial parent has a good payment record&mdash;that is, when there are no arrears outstanding at the date of election and all payments have been made on time for the six month period before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a private arrangement fails, the custodial parent will be able to elect once again to have the liability enforced by the Child Support Agency. The Registrar will be able to collect three months of arrears upon application for CSA enforcement. In exceptional circumstances the Registrar will be able to collect up to nine months of arrears.</PARA>

These bills provide authority for the additional appropriation moneys sought for this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing these bills. It is not in our nature to oppose appropriation bills, of course, as has been made clear time and time again by the opposition, including the shadow Treasurer, Mr Costello, who made that point very firmly and forcibly yesterday, despite the cant of both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis). Whilst not opposing these bills, I will be moving a second reading amendment on behalf of the coalition, and that will be circulated in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an amendment condemning the government for its failure to pursue responsible economic policies, which failure has led to a massive increase in interest rates, harming all Australian businesses, families and home buyers; continuing levels of unacceptably high unemployment; the certainty now of savage tax increases in the May 1995 budget; and a huge deterioration in Australia's balance of payments which has increased Australia's foreign debt to record levels. As a result of that, it has threatened increasingly our national independence and a continuation of the boom-bust cycles which have been the hallmark of the Labor government's disastrous performance since it came to power in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going into some of the details of the matters that I wish to raise in relation to the state of the economy and the government's handling of it, I want to raise an important matter so far as the remaining conduct of the debate over these appropriation bills is concerned. This year we are experiencing a new process in terms of the conduct and processing of additional estimates. I hope the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), who is at the table, is listening to this because I am putting the government on very serious notice. Perhaps when Senator Crowley can get around to listening to this, I will continue. I am saying to the government that the opposition will not allow the passage of these appropriation bills until the proper processes laid out for this parliament to follow have been pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have struck enormous difficulty on our side of the chamber in getting from government ministers the answers to questions that were posed to them during the Senate additional estimates committee hearings in November last year. The supplementary additional estimates hearings due to take place in the next couple of weeks rely very importantly on getting answers to those questions that were asked before Christmas. There are several departments that have not yet done the Senate the courtesy of providing answers to those questions. Until those questions are answered and the answers provided, it is not possible for the Senate to formulate the necessary follow-up questions that will be undertaken in the supplementary additional estimates hearings about to take place and therefore the process cannot be properly conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to the government that the coalition will not allow these appropriation bills to pass unless and until the government has followed the processes that have been laid down for the proper conduct of this matter. I am staggered that the minister at the table has not had the courtesy even to listen to what I am putting to her. I would have thought that this is a matter of extreme importance for the government in terms of the pursuit of its timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These appropriation bills are being debated at a time of great crisis for the Australian economy and for the government. We have a situation where yesterday the Prime Minister hit the airwaves. He had a major tantrum on air because he was questioned by a radio interviewer who had allowed the opposition to have a view on the state of the economy. The Prime Minister, when questioned, really went off his trolley because he had deigned to give an interview and then the details and his interpretation of events were questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer yesterday indicated in the strongest possible terms that he, too, has become a deficit dalek&mdash;an accusation which the Prime Minister made against those of us who had been constantly drawing attention to the need for firm fiscal policy and particularly expenditure reduction to get rid of the huge waste and duplication that this government has involved taxpayers' money in year in and year out since it took office and which we have been pursuing the government on ever since it embarked on this reckless adventure of expenditure. The Prime Minister last year accused us and anyone else who dared to question the performance of the government in the area of fiscal policy as budget and deficit wreckers, or budget daleks, or whatever term came to his mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had the Treasurer virtually admitting that the economic policies that the government has been pursuing have failed. They have failed miserably. As a result of that, we have had in the last three or four months almost a 60 per cent increase in interest rates. We have seen little fall in unemployment; it remains at unacceptably high levels. We have seen the government go absolutely dead on any form of continuing micro-economic reform, which is absolutely essential if this nation of ours is going to be able to continue to grow on a sustainable basis in the future. </PARA>

The Treasurer admitted yesterday that his budget estimate is going to be something like 50 per cent wrong and that the budget estimate for the current account deficit of something like $18 billion, which was far too high anyway, is now going to look more like $26 billion&mdash;almost six per cent of GDP, precisely the sort of level that the deficit was back in those dreadful days of May 1986 when the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister Keating, made his infamous banana republic statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the then Treasurer drew attention to the extreme dangers that the Australian economy was facing because of the blow-out of its external accounts&mdash;for other reasons as well, but particularly the external side&mdash;and he pulled the plug on the Australian economy. Down we went into another recession. Up we came until the same thing happened in 1990: down we went again. Now we are on the way up and before we are even halfway up the government is about to pull the plug on the economy again and send us on this tragic boom-bust cycle that has been so devastating to the Australian economy and to every Australian in terms of their standards of living throughout the period of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign debt, which was something like $23 billion when Labor came to power in 1983, is in 1995 more than $160 billion. There has been an eightfold increase in the foreign debt of this nation during the period of Labor's term of office. That is not just an economic problem. That is a problem of huge dimensions in terms of Australia's independence in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get this Prime Minister talking about our lack of independence because we happen not to be a republic. The greatest damage to our independence and our sovereignty is to have the government put the nation into hock to the rest of the world. That is precisely what the policies of this government have done throughout the period of Labor's term in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interest rate situation is exacerbating the problem. Because of rising interest rates, external debt this year is going to be increased by a further $1 billion to $1 1/2 billion above the earlier estimate, simply because of rising interest rates. Interest rates are increasing in the rest of the world, but they are increasing more in Australia. In real terms, we now have the highest interest rates of any country in the industrialised world&mdash;far higher than interest rates in the countries of Asia which are amongst our major trading and competitive partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that the government claims it has done during its term of office, particularly in the last couple of years&mdash;we have heard all the hype in recent months about how the economy is growing&mdash;no sooner does growth start than we have a situation which takes us back automatically to the dangers and the dark days of the mid-1980s and to the recession period starting in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy of the highest order that all the advantages a nation like Australia has&mdash;the resources, the skills, the talent, the geographical position in relation to the fastest growing region in the world&mdash;cannot be capitalised on, cannot be used to build a sustainable economic growth, low unemployment, low interest rate, low taxation economy. Those advantages cannot be capitalised on for one reason only, and that is the gross irresponsibility of this government in managing the finances of the nation and, in particular, its total failure to pursue economic policies of a fiscal nature&mdash;the budget policy&mdash;which are appropriate to the needs and the circumstances of Australia.</PARA>

Interest rate rises have hit this group the hardest and Keating cannot expect them to swallow for a second time the same excuses as he gave before the recession. Thirteen years of Labor government have left the rich richer and the poor poorer, a travesty of Labor policies; big money manipulators like Bond and Skase get off practically scot free, so that Labor's principles of social justice are made a mockery. Other nails in Keating's political coffin, he says, are: the woodchip licences . . .</PARA>

It has destroyed, is destroying and will continue to destroy the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Australians and their families who are dependent on the timber industry in all its phases. That is associated with the government's failure to allow the development of new pulp and paper mills in Australia. In other words, the dead hand of Labor has prevented the growth of industry in Australia in a way which will not enable us to capitalise on the great natural advantages that we have&mdash;the skills of our people and our export potential as a nation. </PARA>

There are reports in today's press that up to five members of the Labor Party here in Canberra, five members of parliament, could resign over the government's handling of the woodchip licences issue. One senator from Tasmania has already resigned over the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous division within the government. I believe that yesterday and today's comments by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer show that they are going to be at  loggerheads over the next few months on the course of economic policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that we had a government which took seriously the need to control its expenditure in order to eliminate the enormous waste and duplication that is involved in its accounts. The government spends something like $120 billion a year, yet it does not seem to be able to find its way to make even minor reductions in that expenditure&mdash;minor reductions, in a relative sense, which would have an enormous effect on the whole finances of the country. The government has said&mdash;I think the Treasurer said yesterday&mdash;that it would be trying to get the budget back into balance a couple of years earlier than it was planning to do formerly; it is planning to do it in a couple of years time instead of in four years time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Short with regard to these appropriation bills. As he has said, the coalition will not be opposing these bills but proposes to use the debate to highlight the weaknesses in the government's economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that needs to be made is that the government continues to hide its head in the sand over the state of the national economy. It fails to concede that the current deficit reduction strategy is exacerbating the boom and bust tendency of the economy. Although we welcome the information which came from Treasurer Willis last night and yesterday, we wonder why we have to wait until May before there is any real action from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increases in official interest rates over the past few months are evidence of the wrong direction of the government's economic policy. The government has tended to rely more heavily on monetary policy&mdash;that is, increasing interest rates&mdash;rather than a more responsible fiscal policy. Budget Paper No. 1 for 1994-95 indicates, for example, that between 1991-92 and 1995-96, as a result of its continuing deficit financing, the government will have increased public sector debt by almost $64 billion&mdash;I repeat: $64 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's large structural deficit has arisen not primarily as a result of cuts to taxation but as a result of large increases in spending. Between 1989-90 and 1993-94 the Commonwealth government's current outlays grew by an average rate of 8.5 per cent per year. In that time these outlays increased from 23.5 per cent of gross domestic product, GDP, to 27 per cent of GDP. The Commonwealth's own general purpose outlays&mdash;that is, excluding grants to the states and territories&mdash;are expected to grow by 7.7 per cent in this financial year to a record high of 21 per cent of GDP, the highest on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last several years we have seen the state governments reduce their outlays quite substantially; particularly over the last three years, most state governments have reduced their outlays. But during that same period of time, during the recession, the Commonwealth government has made virtually no reductions in outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me cite the actual real increases in expenditure by this government over the last several years. In the 1990-91 budget, the real increase in expenditure was 4.8 per cent; in 1991-92, 5.1 per cent; in 1992-93, 5.6 per cent; in 1993-94, three per cent; and in 1994-95, 3.1 per cent. They are all real increases, so you can add inflation on top of that to get the actual increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has done nothing to contain its expenditure. By comparison, all the state governments have made major efforts to contain their expenditure, trim their budgets, be more efficient and have less waste. When comparing this with the private sector, everyone in the community knows that right through the last three years of the recession every organisation in Australia had to trim its budget, get more lean and efficient and become more internationally competitive. Here we have all of Australia&mdash;apart from the Commonwealth government&mdash;trimming budgets and becoming more efficient. But the Commonwealth government has done exactly the reverse. It has kept spending taxpayers' dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have the result of those excesses. The economy is in trouble. We have had significant growth for a short period of time, but we now have the warning signs, because interest rates are rising fast and will continue to rise, and the government has given notice to us that it is going to increase taxes. The poorer parts of the community&mdash;the unemployed and those people in small businesses&mdash;are going to get hit again. People with mortgages have already been frightened away from the marketplace. How are they going to continue and want to invest and expand? They will not want to do so, because they are scared about what will happen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 Commonwealth budget made no effort to contain current outlays. Despite an improving economy, with less demand on a number of key welfare and associated transfer payments, the Commonwealth increased its current outlays by 6.6 per cent. The states, by comparison, increased their level of current outlays by 3.8 per cent in the same financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must now concede that its fiscal priorities are wrong. It is spending too much and taxing too much. As a result of that strategy, all Australians are paying a premium on interest rates. I remind you that interest rates have gone up by 2.75 per cent at the short end in the last few months. Already the markets are signalling that they are going to go up further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Short said before, we have the highest real interest rates in the world at the long end. Why? Because the world does not believe that this government is serious about inflation and serious about running a tight fiscal policy. As a result, everyone is paying the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A plea for a faster deficit reduction program was made recently by the Governor of the Reserve Bank in the bank's recent annual report. In that report, the Governor called on the government to do much better in its deficit reduction strategy. The Governor said, in essence, that the level and composition of economic growth in Australia in the years ahead would be influenced by the ability of the government to do better in its deficit reduction strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a clear message to the Treasurer that the deficit was too high and that the deficit reduction target is not good enough. It was also a clear message to the government that, unless remedial action is taken on fiscal policy, there will be continued pressure on monetary policy which will result in unnecessary increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we welcomed Treasurer Willis's statement yesterday that the government is serious about bringing forward its fiscal targets of getting into surplus earlier than it indicated previously. It has brought forward the target of getting into surplus that it set at the budget last year by two years. Really, we ought to be in surplus right now. While the economy is growing at 5 1/2 per cent, and it has been at six per cent, we should be in surplus instead of in deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank report also highlighted the importance of a structural improvement in our national savings. That is what the coalition has been saying for a long time: get the deficit reduction down and increase savings. The most significant culprit in Australia's current dis-savings strategy is the federal government itself. The federal government can have an important impact on national savings by reducing its level of deficit financing. Unless it does that and does it quickly households will, to quote the Reserve Bank annual report, `become exposed to the risk of interest rate rises'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing adverse trends in the nation's balance of payments figures are a further illustration of the dangers that face the Australian economy unless the government is prepared to be more fiscally responsible. The government will continue to be a major contributor to the current account deficit and the growth in foreign debt because of its deficit strategy. In the 12 years to 1993-94, Australia's net foreign debt has risen from 13.4 per cent of GDP to almost 37 per cent of GDP as at the end of September last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further underlying warning of the disastrous effects of running a continuing high current account deficit has recently been outlined by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve in the USA, Alan Greenspan, who has suggested that the Mexican monetary crisis may well have what he calls a contagion effect on all world economies. By definition, such an effect would lead to a drying up of capital flows, particularly to those countries, such as Australia, which run high current account deficits. The resulting devaluation of the exchange rate would require sharp increases in interest rates in order to stem the capital outflow. The magnitude of those increases would certainly stall the level of economic growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot of talk from the government about the quality of its budgetary management, but the truth is that the federal government has never, in the past 11 years, reduced the real level of its own purpose spending. The government's answer to deficit reduction even now is to focus on taxation increases rather than reductions in spending. I contrast that to the attitude of the state governments and the 700,000 to 800,000 businesses in Australia that have been through cost reduction strategies over the last several years. Those people wonder why the Commonwealth government has not done more to reduce costs. For the government to claim that costs cannot be reduced from a total budget of $120 billion is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the private sector, there would be no managing director worth his salt that could not achieve very substantial cost savings in whatever enterprise he is managing. I could quote my home state of Tasmania or we could look at what Victorian government has done in this regard. Both those state governments have substantially reduced expenditure in real terms over the last few years. As a consequence, they have much leaner and more efficient state government services. There is no reason in the world why the Commonwealth government could not do exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Business Council of Australia and other business groups urged the government to adopt a speedier deficit reduction strategy by implementing spending cuts of $5 billion. The BCA rejects calls for taxation rises to reduce the deficit and suggests instead that there ought to be an external review of government spending to isolate those areas where expenditure could be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had examples in the other states where external reviews have worked well. In New South Wales, the Greiner government had an external audit of expenditure and it adopted most of the recommendations that came out of that process. The Victorian Kennett government did a similar thing. Again, that was an excellent process and it adopted most of the recommendations that came out of that process. In my home state of Tasmania I was involved for a while in setting up and helping manage an audit for the Groom government when it first came to power nearly three years ago. It was designed to do exactly the same thing and proved to be an excellent and very worthwhile process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this month Professor Ross Garnaut, a former adviser to the Hawke government, issued a blunt warning that the budget deficit must be erased if continued economic growth was to be assured. Professor Hughes, another adviser to the government, gave similar advice. The other day Standard and Poors warned Australia that its credit rating was at risk unless the budget deficit was reduced. We welcome the Treasurer's announcement, but it is too late, not enough and there are no details about what we are going to do. Why do we have to wait until May before adopting actions to reduce the budget deficit? Why can't we do it now? If it was done now, we would relieve the pressure on interest rates, but the government says we are going to wait until May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast Australia's position with that of our neighbour just across the Tasman. When we in the coalition have said to the government that it has been weary on micro-economic reform and that it should look at what our neighbours across the Tasman have been doing, we have been told to avoid the New Zealand idea of freeing up the labour market; we have been told to avoid the New Zealand strategy of cutting back on wasteful government expenditure; we have been told that the New Zealand government's strategy of budgeting for a surplus and paying back foreign debt would have disastrous implications for the New Zealand economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those doubters, the facts are clear and unequivocal. The New Zealand economy is currently growing at 5.3 per cent a year, with growth of 4.6 per cent forecast for the next financial year. Unemployment is expected to decline to 8.5 per cent this year and to 7.5 per cent within two years. The New Zealand budget now has a surplus&mdash;contrast that with our deficit&mdash;of 0.6 per cent of GDP, which is expected to increase to 2.7 per cent of GDP next year and 5.1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The budget actually went into surplus in 1993-94, three years earlier than originally expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand government plans to use the increased budget surpluses&mdash;which after all are savings&mdash;to reduce New Zealand's net public debt to less than 30 per cent of GDP by 1996-97, compared with 48 per cent in 1992-93, which is much worse than that in Australia. While our federal government attempts to convince the financial markets that it is aiming for a budget deficit of one per cent by 1996-97&mdash;it announced yesterday that it intends to get into surplus by 1996-97&mdash;New Zealand will be achieving a surplus equivalent to 5.1 per cent of GDP in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can believe the New Zealand story. What has it done? It has adopted a much tougher financial strategy than this government in Australia. New Zealand people are reaping the benefits from that. As a consequence, they have much greater credibility in financial markets and hence their long-term interest rates are lower than ours. People in New Zealand do not pay as high a premium on the long-term interest rates as we do here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government really has made a mess of running this economy, particularly with regard to keeping its own house in order. Who can forget the One Nation statement, designed as a blatant political document with overly inflated forecasts of employment and economic growth and the promise of a return to budget surplus by 1995-96? That is right; it promised a return to surplus by next financial year. We ought to be in surplus right now. The budget target has changed on a number of occasions since then, and we are now left with a deficit path continuing to at least 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the government has not taken up the task of maintaining true micro-economic reform; of running an efficient central government; of reducing its expenditure; of taking pressure off interest rates; of taking pressure off the unemployed and all businesses in Australia, particularly small business, which is badly affected by the interest rate structure; and of creating more savings in Australia. After all, in the long term, Australia's savings structure is the fundamental problem which we face. Who is the biggest culprit with regard to savings? It is the Commonwealth government itself. The sooner we get into surplus the better. </PARA>

It draws our attention to the almost certain prospect of savage tax increases in the 1995 budget and what effects they will again have on families and home buyers. Senator Short's amendment draws our attention to the huge deterioration in Australia's balance of payments and the consequences that will therefore flow economically. It also draws our attention to the continuation of the unnecessary boom-bust cycles that have been the hallmark of the Labor government's disastrous performance in the last decade. Senator Short's amendment highlights and brings to our attention the need to address the issues of these appropriation bills that are before us today. From my perspective as the shadow minister for housing, I want to spend some time today looking at the effects on families and their homes and the provision of shelter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short also commented at the beginning of his speech on the insult to this Senate directed by the government at the estimates process of this parliament. I asked a series of questions that can really illustrate the same point that Senator Short made. Eleven weeks ago, I asked a series of very important questions relating to the budget effects on housing in Australia, and the answers are not yet in. It has been 11 weeks, and the government cannot attend to the issues that have been put before it, many of them on notice and many of them on the day in the Senate estimates. After 11 weeks, none of that information has yet flowed through to the Senate. Had I put those questions on notice on the formal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> of this Senate, the government would have had to respond to them within 30 days or face the appropriate questioning that would have taken place in this parliament. After 11 weeks, we are here today debating this important information while none of the government replies are yet on the table. It is an appalling disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had similar experiences in the portfolios of transport and the Prime Minister's department relating to the issues of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. None of those answers was supplied. As Senator Short said, whilst we will not be opposing this legislation, we will certainly not give passage to it until all of that appropriate Senate estimates information has been tabled and made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me highlight what answers I was keen to receive before this debate in the areas that vitally interest me but which have not yet been provided. I wanted information on housing statistics, Aboriginal housing, affordability levels in housing and how they affect average Australians, the better cities program and the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. All of those answers are crucial and very relevant to the debate here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of media discussion in the past few weeks as the Minister for Housing and Regional Development and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, has toured around the country with a propaganda machine putting out very prophetic speeches relating to urban development and the future. But I notice in all his statements that Mr Howe did not address any of the detailed questions that I put to him 11 weeks ago. He did not address those specific issues, yet he has the capacity to dream about the nature of the future of Australia and the grand design of new urban development that he foresees. But, when you get down to it, it is all really nothing more than a lot of extra consultancies and bits of money being handed out to mates of either the minister or the government in that area. They are trying to create new industries in exporting our housing potential internationally in order to keep a few jobs in specific areas. However, they will not provide housing for struggling Australians in many of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe's propaganda machine is well and truly gearing up for what he says will be a major housing initiative statement in May. That will follow the housing ministers conference of the Commonwealth and state housing ministers in April, when a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement is to be structured. All Mr Howe will do is pick up off the table the pieces of a new program. So Mr Howe, with his new universal social protection umbrella or the new social justice agenda of this country, is really only responding to a lot of adjectives. There are no hard facts. The questions that were asked 11 weeks ago have not been answered. It is disgraceful that he has not addressed all of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look very carefully at the blow-out in the public housing waiting lists around Australia. We need to concentrate the pressure back on the government. We need to ask the government what is causing those problems in public housing, which Minister Howe wants to address, as he said in his recent statements, by involving the private sector much more in public housing. He is looking for a scapegoat. The problems he did not address in any of his recent statements relate to interest rate management and the effects that has on home owners, home buyers, people renting and the whole housing industry in Australia. Other problems relate to the consequences of unemployment for Australian families in regard to housing issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier&mdash;and it was addressed in Senator Short's amendment&mdash;we need to look at the effects of the current account deficit and its blow-out. The deficit in 1994-95 will be about $24 billion. It was $16 billion last year and it will rise to over $29 billion next year. The OECD expects Australia to have the highest current account deficit as a percentage of GDP in the developed world in 1995 and 1996. Australia's deficit represents about five per cent of GDP&mdash;worse than the US, with 2.4 per cent; the UK, with 1.1 per cent; and Canada, with 3.3 per cent. The effects of the current account deficit need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a foreign debt of $160 billion as at the end of  September 1994. The high interest rates are certainly horrific, are certainly having consequences and are certainly hitting the pockets of every Australian family at the moment, particularly through their home mortgages and home loan interest rates. Our interest rates are among the highest in industrial countries. Australia has the lowest level of savings for fifty years. These are the facts that the government needs to deal with. What about unemployment and the effects on Australia of the fact that nearly 800,000 people are currently out of work? It is the interest rates and the poor investment levels&mdash;Mr Keating's and Mr Howe's responsibility&mdash;that we have now inherited that we have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing gap between the rich and the poor. The recently retired Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, can afford a brand new beautiful castle on the north shore of Sydney, and can quit that home if he likes and go and live in the Ritz hotel. I would hate to know the daily housing rate he must be paying&mdash;or someone is paying. We have the present Prime Minister, Mr Keating, buying $2 two million houses at the top of the housing market in the nice suburbs of Sydney. But what about addressing the problems of the average Australian?  Obviously Mr Hawke and Mr Keating have been able to manage their financial affairs under a very differently structured arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business outlook, particularly as it impacts on mortgages, shows a disastrous scene. The biggest losers are the young married couples with two kids and a mortgage, earning $800 a week, with private health insurance and their own car. Their gains since 1990 from the lower mortgage rates have been mostly offset by rapidly rising health insurance costs. In the period ahead they will have the added weight of higher mortgage costs. That comes from a statement from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly </EMPHASIS>looking at some work compiled by Access Economics. That prophecy will affect hundreds of thousands of average Australian families. What about the quote that surfaced yesterday in the report, that was tabled here, of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation? I refer to the section on arrears at page 9 of that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is interest rates that will determine the level of housing loan default over the next two years. Other factors to be taken into account are an increase in the proportion of loans in excess of 90 per cent loan-to-value ratio and a perceived general decline in loan quality due to intense competition in the home loan market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HLIC expects the level of default to increase towards the end of 1994-95 and to continue to increase in the following year.</PARA>
<PARA>What a prognosis and an expectation for average Australian families that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation has alerted us to that particular area. Buying a home usually represents the single largest lifetime investment for Australian families and involves substantial financial obligations, including maintenance, rates, insurance and mortgage repayments. The traditional means of assessing home affordability is to consider the magnitude of typical mortgage repayments for a typical home purchase and relate these to movements in household income. Family and individual home buyers have to consider how affordable a home is likely to be over a number of years rather than in only the first year. The Keating government has severely shaken home buyers' confidence with increases in mortgage repayments and persistent talk of further increases in interest rates and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the government have to say to those Australians who now find themselves struggling with mortgage repayments and who, through no fault of their own, are paying the price of this government's inability to manage the economy?

What does it say to the home buyers whose loans have become uncapped after one or two years of fixed honeymoon mortgages and now find their repayments have increased to a level that they did not anticipate and they are just able or unable to meet their commitments?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the other people who are caught in this net, the people who are tenants or renters of homes. Let us look at the effect of rising interest rates on families and individuals who rent their homes. Those Australians are among the hidden victims of the interest rate strategy. They will be hurt along with the home buyers. Landlords will need to push up rents to cover their mortgage commitments, and the people caught in the private rental sector will struggle with tighter household budgets as a consequence because their rents will rise. For many of these families, the deposit gap will widen and, therefore, it puts off the prospect of being able to move into the home buying area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the public housing area we will see increasing waiting lists and pressure back on the government through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The latest Real Estate Institute of Australia figures released a few days ago confirm the widening gap between home mortgage repayment and wage rises. That survey revealed that home loan affordability has fallen in three consecutive quarters of 1994, that higher mortgage interest repayments rose by 8.8 per cent during the September quarter while the medium family income increased by 0.7 per cent. The medium family income needed to service an average housing loan rose from $32,680 in the June quarter to $35,545 in the September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government has created a housing market where home buyers at the top and prestige end of the market are able to absorb the higher interest rates while low to middle income home buyers at the other end of the market struggle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has created new class divisions between home owners. With house prices at various levels, there are starts and falls at the bottom end of the market while people at the top end surge ahead. All of the peak groups, whether in the housing industry or the construction and building industry, or those relating to welfare and social issues, have attacked the government over its interest rate strategy. It is worth putting just a couple of quotes on the record. Mr Bob Lim of the Business Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . interest rates hit production and investment. It is critical that production and investment continues to grow. The thought of further rises sent shivers through the ranks of industry, particularly mining, agriculture and small business.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, consequential to that are the effects on families that work in those industries. Mr Ian Spicer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said business confidence will be hit hard, and plans for purchasing new plant and equipment would have to be reconsidered.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the NFF said the interest rate rises were a major blow to farmers struggling to survive the drought. The Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, Mr Rob Bastian, said that small business, almost totally reliant on varying rate loans, regarded the spectre of high interest rates, particularly combined with the prospect of increasing taxes on consumers, as an horrific overkill to cool the economy. Father David Cappo of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission said interest rate rises would harm lower income earners and hit investors. He said that the government has hurt the most vulnerable in our society and that Australian families should not have to shoulder the responsibility of getting the right mix in Australia's monetary and fiscal policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at building approvals we see that for the third month in a row they have slumped. Industry groups fear the housing sector is heading for a nosedive. The market is predicted to fall further, which will mean big job losses. The Housing Industry Association predicts up to 30,000 jobs could be lost this year as construction plummeted under the weight of higher interest rates. Master Builders Association National Economic and Housing Director, Mr Wilhem Harnisch, said the fall in building approvals demonstrated the `devastating' impact recent interest rate rises were having on the housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, we have the Deputy Prime Minister and the housing minister, Mr Howe, trying to play down industry concerns by saying that the downturn in housing activity was `quite a good thing' in the context of an overheating economy. But the housing minister, Mr Howe, has acknowledged that the government should shift the focus towards fiscal policy to control the economy. On the other hand, his Prime Minister continues to stubbornly resist calls to cut the budget deficit further to ease the pressure on interest rates and is intent on imposing on Australian home buyers and renters&mdash;never let us forget those people who are caught in the rent market&mdash;the suffocating high rates of the 1980s. So we have a predicament where the housing and finance figures, the construction figures and the anecdotal evidence for actual work coming out of all the particular groups illustrate this more and more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debating appropriation bills provides one with an opportunity to raise issues that often do not receive much attention, and to put the focus on areas of government neglect and mismanagement. What has concerned me over a long period is that this Labor government trumpets loud and long about what it allegedly does for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country, and yet it is totally neglecting some very vital areas of health concern among those communities. I wish to focus on that today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee was considering the estimates in November last year a question was asked about a very important issue relating to AIDS in Aboriginal communities. The disturbing response is something that needs much closer attention. The response from the Department of Human Services and Health was that there are `no national publicly available statistics on HIV-AIDS in Aboriginal communities' and that the decision to record such statistics was up to the communities themselves as they had previously indicated that they do not wish to have Aboriginality identified at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is inherently a national problem, a global problem  in fact, is left up to the state and territory health authorities to manage. It is also their responsibility to collect and collate the statistics for Aboriginal communities, and this can only be done if the sufferer identifies himself or herself as being Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state of Western Australia, according to evidence given at the estimates hearing, the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the Aboriginal communities in the north-west has crept up above the national rate of infection. I find that particularly disturbing, but so should this government. I put a question on notice back on 9 December asking the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) what records were being kept, what was being done about it, and about the identification. It would not surprise anyone to know that I still have not got a response&mdash;because it is contradictory to say that no records are being kept. Yet the rate of HIV/AIDS infection in the northern communities of Western Australia is above the national average. How can the statement be made? There must be some records being kept and, if there are not, why not? Why isn't the focus on education much stronger?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I also spoke on the poor living conditions in the northern Western Australian Aboriginal communities, especially those in the Kimberley such Oombulgurri, which is alleged to be the most poorly resourced community in Western Australia with its residents living in Third World conditions. This government, as I say, trumpets loud and long about the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is simply neglecting them. In Oombulgurri and many other remote communities there is a chronic infestation rate of scabies; threadworm; hookworm; trachoma; gastroenteritis; ear, chest and skin infection; chronic diarrhoea; and sexually transmitted disease. What is this government doing to resolve those very serious problems in those communities? The answer is simply nothing. Houses overflow with raw sewage, and infection is spread rapidly by flies and inadequate housing and hygiene. Alcoholism also has an iron grip on these communities. This in turn leads to unsafe sexual practices, among many other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These poor living conditions, matched with the often unsafe and promiscuous sexual patterns of the people living there, are creating the perfect environment for an AIDS epidemic, and this government should be focusing on how to resolve the problem. It is claimed that these living conditions will also see Aboriginal people die more quickly than most people after contracting the virus because of their general state of poor health and lack of available medical care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A full-blown AIDS epidemic would be devastating to the members of those communities, who are largely untouched by AIDS education campaigns and who are unfamiliar with the cause of the messages conveyed in advertisements describing the grim reaper, symbolic games of russian roulette and the beds campaign or the `be safe, be sure' message. Those campaigns are not relevant to those communities, so there is no point in this government pointing out to me the amount of money that it is spending on AIDS education when none of that education is targeted specifically to those communities to which I am now referring. They are totally untouched by printed literature, as many of them, of course, are unable to read the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident from reports of the growing incidence of syphilis in Aboriginal communities that an HIV epidemic is simply a time bomb waiting to happen. Is anything being done to prevent that time bomb exploding? The answer, apparently, is no. If I could get an answer out of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, we might be able to see some light on the horizon, but she refuses to even answer the questions. One can only assume there are no answers and there are no directions being taken. If STDs are continuing to take hold at the current rate, then it follows that the same unsafe sexual practices which are causing cross-infection will also lead to the spreading of the AIDS virus. In the federal government's national HIV/AIDS strategy 1993-94 to 1995-96 it was noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an urgent need to continue and strengthen cooperative efforts to increase knowledge and practice of safe sex and safe drug injecting practices in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The continuing low health status and the high levels of alcohol use and sexually transmitted diseases in some of these communities and high rates of incarceration amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are indicators of conditions which would potentially facilitate the spread of HIV.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of that statement in the government's own strategy, what efforts have been made, what effects have they had and at what cost? The strategy also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The available data on HIV and AIDS in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population indicate rates that are comparable to the non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australian population. However, the high level of STD's reported from a number of parts of Australia with higher proportions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations indicates the potential for a substantial increase in HIV transmission, given the evidence that other sexually transmitted diseases are both markers of sexual practice and enhance the transmission of HIV.</PARA>
<PARA>Evidence of this appeared in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 9 January 1995 headed `Aboriginal syphilis shock'. In that report it was claimed that syphilis has become almost exclusively an Aboriginal disease, with the rate of infection in WA Aboriginal males at 386.5 per 100,000. That figure compares with a non-Aboriginal rate of three per 100,000. Among Aboriginal females the rate is 391.4 per 100,000, compared with a rate of 2.2 per 100,000 in non-Aboriginal females. Aborigines as young as 13 were found to have the disease. The incidence of congenital syphilis&mdash;babies contracting the disease from the mother&mdash;was also of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics on gonorrhoea are also unfavourable, with 1,000 Aborigines per 100,000 suffering the disease, compared with a rate of 180 per 100,000 in the non-Aboriginal population. Those statistics are very alarming. For the government to be sitting on its hands doing absolutely nothing is unacceptable to the extreme. Again it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an increase in the incidence of syphilis is likely to be an important indicator of changes in patterns of sexual behaviour which may in turn influence the transmission of HIV.</PARA>
<PARA>Additionally, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in December last  year a black wave of the epidemic was reported. In that report, health authorities claimed that the epidemic was in its first silent phase, with transmission occurring but the infection not present long enough in the community for people to present themselves with AIDS illnesses. In that same article, Dr Frank Bowden, head of AIDS and sexually transmitted disease programs in the Northern Territory health department, was reported as saying that forecasts based on health and social trends in the community indicated a doubling time of the epidemic of about one year, which was in line with African and South-East Asian communities. He also, quite alarmingly, I believe, estimated that the speed of the epidemic suggested that up to 20 per cent of the territory's Aboriginal population could be infected by the year 2000, a figure which he said was concerning and bound to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those particular figures coming from professional people, why is this government doing nothing to prevent this problem? It is clear that plenty of money is being poured into nationwide advertising campaigns, education campaigns and AIDS organisations and advisory bodies, but that information is not getting to the Aboriginal communities. In last year's budget paper, for example, the government set aside $58.5 million for the treatment of AIDS patients in public hospitals and promised an allocation of $54.3 million in 1994-95 in the form of grants for education and prevention, treatment, care and training, the national public education campaign and research activities. Incidentally, its estimate for 1995-96 is $50.4 million&mdash;almost $4 million less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with most of the government's directions in health, it would seem that much more money is being spent on treatment than on critical research and prevention programs which would ultimately save it a great deal of money in the long term. But the government would seem to be totally and utterly myopic on this issue, as with many other health issues. The attitude of this government is to throw money at the problem after it has happened instead of preventing it happening in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a program of matched funding under which each state and territory receives a base grant of $250,000 with remaining funds being split according to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, total population and the number of people living with AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, I point out that in the 1994-95 budget the federal government committed $110 million of the foreign aid budget to a four-year health initiative focusing in part on HIV/AIDS in countries in the Asia-Pacific region with the aim being to help overcome the growing incidence of the disease in the region. The motivation, according to a related budget paper, is that HIV is a domestic concern for Australia and growing tourism and economic linkages with countries in the region could potentially increase the incidence of infection in Australia. Probably no-one would deny that and probably no-one would say that that money should not be spent, but when there is a problem right at your back door, with your own communities getting no money and no specific research being done, you really have to question why you send money offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not so clear is how much money allocated for AIDS-related health programs within Australia is being specifically targeted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote northern communities. Furthermore, it is also unclear whether any of the $40 million set aside for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health funds will specifically cover effective AIDS education and awareness in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the same year that the first National Aboriginal HIV/AIDS Conference took place in Alice Springs, a paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AIDS policy&mdash;have we got it right? </EMPHASIS>was presented to the Australian Doctors Fund in Sydney by Stanley Nangala, chairman of the communicable diseases advisory panel within ATSIC. He intended to bring to the forum an Aboriginal point of view on the AIDS issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his paper, Mr Nangala argued that the government must consider a number of urgent policy directives including the provision of more information on HIV/AIDS to Aboriginal leaders to encourage them to put it higher on their agendas; the provision of culturally appropriate and locally based education programs which explain the threat of AIDS, how it is spread and how it can be prevented; and the provision of programs to target specific Aboriginal groups such as the young, young homosexuals or bisexuals, and drug injectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With no proper research being done, there is also great concern that there is no documentation on the spread of AIDS in the heterosexual community. As with the rest of the community, with this disease you cannot simply focus on one area and say, `We have done our job.' We have to have a total perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is some criticism over the effectiveness of culturally appropriate programs and interfering with the objectives of more general strategies, there is no argument that education, followed by safer sexual and drug using practices, is probably the answer. But it needs to be targeted. How many of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia have been consulted as the most appropriate way for this to be handled?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from that, part of the national HIV/AIDS strategy referred to the need for special ATSIC education initiatives. In the 1993-94 report on social justice for indigenous Australians, these were described as being a series of projects including television commercials, workshops and the development of community support systems for Aboriginal health care workers to be coordinated within guidelines of the Australian National Council on AIDS. Yet, overall there is still a piecemeal approach to this problem and a more holistic approach is desperately needed before it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently no national data available. Consequently, I would argue that there can be no forward planning at the federal level by the Department of Human Services and Health, by the National Council on AIDS or by any other body. If the minister would care to answer some questions, we might find out what the direction of this is. But Mr Nangala argued in his article that the recording of racially based data would set Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people up for further discrimination. That might be so, but without it I would argue that they are being set up for a big let down again by the federal government when it comes to programs on HIV and AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is paternalistic at all to say that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are going to have a problem managing such data and developing appropriate solutions on their own. They are already facing a number of monolithic obstacles which have prevented them from taking better care of their communities and this is greatly hindered by the federal government's reluctance to offer more definite assistance in health management issues. Aboriginal communities can still retain their culture and their dignity while simultaneously seeking help on the AIDS issue and other issues from the federal government. Without that help, it can be argued that the federal government is doing nothing but writing a recipe for genocide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The late Australian of the Year Fred Hollows warned us in May 1992 that it should be obvious that Aboriginal communities could be decimated by AIDS as they were by the smallpox epidemics of 1789 and 1829. At One Arm Point, north-west of Derby in Western Australia, the chairman of the Bardi community, Mr Eric Hunter, was reported in February last year as agreeing with Professor Hollows and expressing a grave fear not only for his people but also for those in communities around Derby, Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek where the AIDS message is simply not getting through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that it is only pure luck that AIDS has not swept through the Aboriginal communities in northern Australia. All the early indications are there, with the STD infection rates, that the time bomb is threatening to go off. To record data on the basis of Aboriginality might be paternalistic to some and discriminatory to others, but even ATSIC wants more to be done. Just last year the deputy chairman of ATSIC, Sol Bellear, told a conference of the Interdepartmental Group on HIV/AIDS that the virus posed a terrible threat to communities in remote Australia and that it was a miracle the predicted AIDS catastrophe had not yet occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, as a representative of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Mr Bellear criticised the lack of national data and statistics on the spread of AIDS in Aboriginal communities. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not know what the current situation is. We do not know the incidence or rate of infection for much of remote and rural Australia. The reality is that HIV/AIDS poses a terrible threat to many of our communities as long as conditions remain as they are. Why is there such complacency?  Is it because this issue seems far too difficult and the communities far too remote? Many Aboriginal leaders are deeply disturbed by the possibility of yet another tragedy confronting indigenous Australians in the form of an HIV/AIDS epidemic. If action is not taken then in the eyes of the world Australia will be found guilty and condemned of no less a crime than that of the genocide of its indigenous peoples.</PARA>

HIV/AIDS is a real problem and the first problem that has to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, again, in the middle of a boom-bust cycle, which is the hallmark of this government. I would prefer to call these bills the `misappropriation bills' rather than the `appropriation bills'. When I use the term `misappropriation', I do not mean it in a criminal sense or anything like that. I mean `misappropriated' as in that things have been put in the wrong places. That is what I believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the boom-bust cycle damages not only the boom-bust industries that we have in Australia. The most damage that is done is to the stable industries of Australia&mdash;the ones that year in, year out, provide Australia's foreign export income. In this category I place the gold industry, although it has not been of the boom-bust type in the last 15 years; the coal industry, which is a very even industry that keeps going over the years supplying export income; and all primary industries with the exception of wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool had a massive downturn from 1988 to 1993, but that was through the fault of no one other than that of its so-called leaders of that time. I include in that the government and the then minister for primary industry in that they listened to the demands for the implementation of a scurrilous wool marketing plan that led to the downfall of that industry. Fortunately, that industry is reviving now. We do not have a great boom and bust in primary industries, although the boom and</PARA>
<PARA>bust mentality of this government certainly knocks them around no end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interest rates that cause generally stable industries to boom and bust. As I said, they include the coal industry, primary industry, the gold industry and quite a few others. Those industries most of all need interest rates to remain stable. The biggest effect that interest rates have on those industries occurs when they come to purchase new plant. New plant is required on an ongoing basis. No industry and no business within any industry can afford to let its plant run down. It must keep its plant up. It must have a plant replacement schedule and keep that going over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hgher interest rates, or a massive rise in interest rates as we have had from this government in the last four or five months, cause businesses to delay purchasing new plant as part of their schedule. Once you have postponed acquiring an item of plant that should be replaced&mdash;one that has outlived its useful purpose or life&mdash;greater problems arise because you have more frequent and bigger breakdowns which become costly, yet you cannot afford not to repair them. The way to carry a good plant is to have a plan and stick to it, turning that plant over every three, five or seven years, or whatever may be appropriate as to the length of time that particular item of plant may last. So higher interest rates, and particularly higher interest rates which occur suddenly, throw plant replacement schedules out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, more in the area of primary industry, is the situation where interest rates badly affect people with their ongoing equipment. They may borrow money, say, to put in a crop, as many farmers do every year, and then repay that loan at the end of harvesting; high interest rates knock that budget around right from the word go. Then, too, a primary producer who wants to expand and buy the farm next door when it becomes available, or farm in a higher rainfall or lower rainfall area, is affected by a sudden rise in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the trouble with this government with its boom-bust mentality and cycle that is occurring: it is knocking around and damaging the basic industries that keep Australia going. The government must be condemned for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promises were made to us in the last federal election&mdash;the election that was won by this government by about 1,250 votes, if I can remember back that far&mdash;of no new taxes and no increases in taxes. As I said earlier, these appropriation bills are more about how money is misappropriated rather than the government's willy-nilly changing of directions with the appropriating of money to try to keep on side its diminishing number of supporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this happen in the last week. Workers in the forest industry are surrounding Parliament House, and they were still here this morning. They have changed their plans halfway through because they have budgeted on getting so many logs out. The mills have budgeted on getting so many logs, and they have contracts with overseas companies to supply certain orders. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) makes a big change in direction because he can see some greenie, loony, leftie votes going out the door. The government makes those decisions on the run that damage the industries of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am on about is priority. I do not expect the government to spend more money. I am calling on the government to spend money wisely and to appropriate it to where it should be going, not to branch off down rabbit warrens where it thinks money is needed at different times just to keep a few voters onside. Of course, 1,200 votes made a big difference last election. Those sorts of votes can make a big difference in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about the `no new taxes' and `no higher taxes', I will mention the carbon tax. Anyone who watched our Treasurer, Mr Willis, last evening on TV would have seen that he did not rule out a carbon tax. No doubt we will debate the carbon tax when the government introduces it in the next budget, but I would like to give the government a bit of advice while it is talking about a carbon tax. A carbon tax, as the name implies, is to encourage operators of plant or whatever to put less carbon into the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one could say that it is a fair enough move to have a tax to cut down that carbon content in the atmosphere. But if you are talking about the increase in carbon in the atmosphere and you are thinking of penalising industries that put carbon into the atmosphere, I believe that you should give credit to the other side, to the industries that reduce carbon in the atmosphere. Of course, the biggest reducers of carbon in the atmosphere are farmers right around the world who plant crops of whatever sort. </PARA>

You do not need me to tell you how important roads are for the welfare of Australian industry. Of more importance to me are the roads in Western Australia, where we produce 25 per cent, and rising, of Australia's foreign export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983&mdash;and I will give you more definite figures later&mdash;there have been massive increases in fuel taxes and cuts in road funding. One could excuse the government for massive increases in fuel taxes. I always say `fuel taxes'. A lot of people call them `petrol taxes', but fuel is right across the board. You could excuse the government, but when such taxes are just used as a milking cow to fund its own favourite programs, I believe that it wants to be taken to task. While that has been going on, road funding has been continually going down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has massively increased fuel taxes since the ALP came into office in 1983. Fuel taxes affect the cost of everything around Australia. Since the last election, which is not quite two years ago, the cost of the fuel excise to the average motorist and every family is $150 a year. In that short time the fuel excise levy has risen from 26c to 32c and it is going up further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 21 August 1973 the excise in Australia was 4.905c per litre, which is almost 5c. It took one month short of 10 years for it to increase to 7.155c. So in the 10 years from August 1973 to 1 July 1983 it moved only 2c. It is very obvious why it changed in 1983. Then from 1 July 1983 to 1 August 1994&mdash;that is 11 years&mdash;it has gone from 7.155c to 32.088c and rising. You have had a 500 per cent increase. In 10 years of coalition government it went up by 2c, and in 10 years of Labor government, it has gone up by 500 per cent. The government should be condemned for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will now mention the issue of road funding or the lack of road funding in Western Australia. Western Australia has a road network of 170,000 kilometres. Its road assets at the present moment stand at $15 billion, but they are depreciating at $80 million per year. Western Australia has a 16-year, $1.2 billion backlog in road re-building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia supplies 25 per cent of Australia's foreign export income and that 25 per cent of Australia's foreign export income comes mainly from rural and very remote areas. The minister at the table, who represents Western Australia, knows how far those commodities are transported by road, rail or whatever to get to the ports. He should know and the Senate should know that good roads are important for Western Australia for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia leads the world in the amount of road transport per capita. Because of the size and extent of our continent and because our mineral resources are situated in very remote areas, that is understandable. Western Australia's state freight task is growing at a rate of 10 per cent per annum. This is because of the expansion of the rural resource sectors of Western Australia which has, incidentally, resulted from the rapid change since the Court coalition government came to power. The road task is expanding by 10 per cent a year. Because of the lack of funding from the Commonwealth, funding for national roads is going backwards. Western Australia's freight task is growing by 10 per cent per annum and accounts for 12 per cent of the nation's freight task&mdash;that is, 12 per cent of Australia's road task is in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to discuss road safety, which is very important. There were 34,410 road accidents in Western Australia in 1993. Of course, we all know the cost of road accidents. The cost of road accidents in Western Australia is $1 billion per annum, or $600 per person per year. The road environment is a causative factor of those accidents, and I have plenty of statistics to prove this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the black spot program which Mr Robert Brown introduced into Australia some four or five years ago. Admittedly, I criticised it at the time as an election gimmick that would see funds being spent in marginal seats. But I admit that it was a good program. As it proved to be a good program, I thought this government might continue with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national highways system was defined in 1974. Western Australia now has 4,650 kilometres of national highways; that is, 25 per cent of the national network. Western Australia receives only 7.03 per cent of federal funding allocations for national highways. This compares with 11.70 per cent in 1985-86 and 9.92 per cent in 1975-76. In other words, during the time that the state and national Labor governments have been in power, Western Australia's share of highways has reduced dramatically. We have not got the share that we deserve when you take into account what we produce and the amount that we pay in fuel levies. You would think that the disgraced previous Labor government of Western Australia would have at least tried to keep its roads up if it had friends in Canberra, but it failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal allocations for state and national highways in Western Australia should be increased to a level that will provide what we need and deserve. They should be increased by $40 million per year, but unfortunately that has not happened. We are in the unfortunate situation where the state Liberal-National coalition government of Western Australia has had to increase the state franchise fuel levy by 4c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable senators that every cent that comes out of the fuel franchise levy in Western Australia goes back to roads. It is a pity that other state governments around Australia do not do the same. It is a pity that this federal government does not reinstate the proper priority to Western Australia's roads. The government should be condemned for its mismanagement not only of roads but of everything else in these appropriation bills or, as I said, `misappropriation bills'.

The consequences of that for them and their families would be devastating. But, in terms of the annual appropriations of the Commonwealth government, those individuals and their businesses would go from being net contributors to the Australian economy and the Commonwealth in terms of paying tax, company tax, export revenue and sales taxes to creators of a net reduction in Commonwealth revenues because they would go on to the dole and receive their income from the Commonwealth rather than give it to the Commonwealth. That is a very cold and crude analysis of the logging debate. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having spent some hours talking to many loggers over the last few days, I know that many of them are very worried about having to lose their businesses, jobs, trucks and livelihoods.

It really makes one wonder what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has learnt since he made his famous banana republic speech in the late 1980s. In terms of the performance of the Australian economy and its fundamental institutional framework, nothing has really changed since Mr Keating made that speech.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now entered a new boom. John Howard put it very nicely on Monday when he said that the Australian people are wondering how well off Australia really is after five minutes of economic sunlight. It must appear that way to so many people with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the various ministers saying how well Australia is going. People in the community are saying, `It might be great for you guys, the people who have jobs and the friends of the Labor Party, but it is very tough for us, particularly those of us who do not have jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>has printed a very disturbing article on the attitudes of young people in this nation to the economic outlook. I will quote from a survey conducted by a Melbourne based research group that interviewed 400 young Australians across most of the states in the 15-19 age group. They are basically young people who are leaving school and looking at going to university. We would hope that they are looking forward to entering the work force and getting on with their lives. What is interesting in terms of this debate is that a general theme came from these young people. The most disturbing theme was that most of them are very worried and uncertain about the future. Many said that even if they go to university they are unsure about getting jobs at the end of it. That very disturbing theme came from this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following response is interesting in relation to the economic debate&mdash;and I guess it paraphrases the responses of many of the young people who spoke to the survey company.

In other words, there is a feeling of alienation, a feeling that things are beyond people's control.

Now that we have sensible economic managers in most of the states&mdash;because they are all run by Liberal and coalition governments&mdash;the states have been getting their budgets back in order and tidying up the mess of those disastrous Labor years, left by those paragons of Labor politics such as Brian Burke, if I might start in the west, and his followers Mr Dowding and Carmen Lawrence, the latter who has now moved  to Canberra to spread her wisdom over here. In South Australia we had the Bannon years and the State Bank collapse. We have Dean Brown and his team trying to sort out that mess now in South Australia, trying to get that once proud state back on the road again. In Victoria we had the John Cain and Joan Kirner team heading a once proud state, the crown in the federation&mdash;certainly the jewel in the Liberal crown&mdash;with an incredible history and an incredible people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it would be interesting in this debate&mdash;so I have done some research on it&mdash;to compare the record of the Keating government's economic management with that of those people in those states, who are widely regarded by just about everyone in Australia as having been disastrous economic managers. I mention them again: Brian Burke in Western Australia with Dowding and Lawrence, John Bannon in South Australia with the State Bank collapse, and Cain and Kirner in Victoria. Everyone remembers those names. They should be deeply embedded in the economic debate of Australia. They should be synonymous with Labor economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should do in this debate&mdash;and I will seek to do so&mdash;is to compare their records on debt and tax with Mr Keating's record. Mr Keating, like it or not, has built himself a reputation as a good economic manager. Of course it is not deserved, as you realise if you speak to the 268,000 people in Australia who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months or to the 70,000 young Australians who have been unemployed for more than 12 months or to the 70,000 young Australians who do not have a roof over their heads, our homeless youth. They are probably a little cynical about Mr Keating's claims that Australia is on a good economic course and everything is hunky dory. As Peter Cole Adams said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> today, perhaps Mr Keating should go back to his desk and start working again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare those failed and disastrous state Labor administrations that were all thrown out by the electorates, chucked aside in disgrace, with the economic management of Mr Keating. I will refer to some tables. If you look, for example, at the growth in net debt for the Commonwealth, you will see that the net Commonwealth debt per capita&mdash;I have done an analysis with the net debt and</PARA>
<PARA>the number of taxpayers&mdash;in 1986-87 was $5,915 per head. That has grown, based on the debt figures as predicted in the budget for 1994-95&mdash;and this is at Commonwealth level, I remind the Senate&mdash;to $12,200 per head. So it has more than doubled since the fiscal year 1986-87. That is the Commonwealth record on debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Burke-Dowding-Lawrence governments in Western Australia. The net state debt per taxpayer went from $9,600 per head back in 1986-87 to $11,000 per head in the final year of the Lawrence Labor government. In South Australia in 1986-87 there was a state debt per taxpayer of $6,846, rising to $13,600 in the last year of the Bannon government. Of course we remember that in 1991, the year of the collapse of the State Bank, there was almost a doubling in South Australia because all of a sudden the chickens came home to roost. Again a Labor government was disgraced and thrown out of office in probably the most ignominious fashion in Australia's history. It is probably only comparable to the 1975 landslide here in the federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1986-87&mdash;my good friend from Victoria Julian McGauran will remember this because he lived through it&mdash;the state debt per taxpayer was $11,239. Only a few years later it increased to $15,458. They are big figures compared to the other states; it is big debt. Of course, Mr Stockdale and Mr Kennett are working very hard to bring that state back to the prominence it should have in Australia. Victoria is a great state. It is not as good at football, but they are great people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we need to ensure that we have job creation in Australia? We need interest rates that are stable and low. What do we have? Figures set out on page 115 of the 21 January edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> show that Australia's bank prime lending rate is 11.5 per cent. That journal goes through all of the other OECD countries and we are the only one with double digit interest rates. If we compare this with similar nations such as Britain and the United States, we see that the interest rate is 7.25 in Great Britain and 8.5 per cent in the United States of America. We are paying two, three and four per cent more than businesses and home buyers in the United States and Great Britain for our money. We are trying to compete and sell our products on the world international market, but we have this lead weight in our saddle bags before we even create the first widget or the first thing that we are trying to sell. We are disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the inflation outlook reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine the government is claiming credit for having great achievements in inflation. Inflation makes our economy uncompetitive&mdash;it puts up prices; it puts up wages&mdash;not only for businesses but for every household in this country. It has Australia's inflation outlook for 1995 listed as 3.5 per cent. That is a relatively low figure compared with what we were used to in the Gough Whitlam era, but the outlook of 3.5 per cent happens to be the third highest outlook for inflation in 1995. Who is higher than we are? Only Italy and Spain. Again, on the inflation front, where the government is claiming great credit, Australia has the third highest inflation outlook for the next year amongst all OECD nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot continue to go down the track that this government is continuing to go down. We cannot allow interest rates to be at these levels just because the government cannot control its own spending. It would rather control the spending of individuals than bite the bullet and control its own Commonwealth spending. Spending by this Commonwealth government is actually worse than it was in the Whitlam years. The growth in Commonwealth own purpose spending is worse now than it was in Gough Whitlam's era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is comparing Labor paragons or the things that the people of Australia understand&mdash;although maybe not those from the younger generation. They did not live through the Whitlam government. I am young, but I still lived through that. We remember Whitlam&mdash;a great Australian, a great Prime Minister in many terms. He was a radical Prime Minister but, from an economic point of view, he had a reputation as being an economic disaster. I do not think Mr Whitlam would deny that. The reality is that people understand that he was a disaster when it came to economic management, and the Keating government is worse. We cannot let Mr Keating get away with this concept of the government claiming to be a good economic manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the employment front, on the economic consequences of all this economic mismanagement&mdash;which is what really counts; you can talk in jargon and you can talk in figures but what counts is how lives are affected, particularly, in view of my portfolio responsibilities for youth, young lives&mdash;Julian Pocock, the Executive Director of APAC, the youth policy in action committee, made a very poignant point to me at a seminar held in Parliament House late last year. He said that the federal government's own employment policy&mdash;I think it was the white paper on employment entitled Working Nation&mdash;predicted and made it a matter of national policy that the government would reduce general employment to five per cent by the year 2000. Julian made the point that youth unemployment is generally a factor of three above that. So it is now a matter of federal government policy to have 15 per cent of young Australians unemployed by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the coalition's point of view, that is not acceptable. We cannot marginalise 15 per cent of young Australians. We have to offer them more hope than that. There needs to be a radical change in economic policy in this country. We cannot have a Commonwealth government that tells everyone else to tighten their belts but takes off its belt altogether and drops its economic pants. It is just not on. Those 15 per cent of young people who will not have a job in the year 2000 should be given more hope than that. This government stands condemned for its economic mismanagement and must get its house into order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debating the appropriation bills gives us the opportunity to put on the record the history of the National Party, which has just celebrated its 75th anniversary. It was formed at a meeting held 75 years ago. Eleven members of the federal parliament formed a separate party to represent rural interests and industries.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The National Party grew spontaneously out of the reaction of farmer organisations to price control of commodities after the First World War, objections to high protective tariffs and embargoes, objections to exploitation by the middle man of farmers and their produce and a recognition of the need for special attention to country development and decentralisation of settlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A farmers' political party started firstly in Western Australia in 1913 and appeared in Queensland in 1915, Victoria in 1917, South Australia in 1918, New South Wales in 1921 and Tasmania in 1922, with the formation of the federal party in 1920. As true to its cause and purpose today as it was when it was founded, the National Party has remained the only political organisation represented in the federal parliament which focuses its prime attention on the needs of people living and working beyond the capital cities, and on the businesses and interests they represent. However, it has always been a party of adaptability. Today it speaks for the silent majority of Australians found in the cities as well as in the country who, like it, unashamedly support the wealth-creating industries of Australia, believe in equal opportunity and access to facilities for all Australians, support a fair go for small business with its potential to create jobs, and respect and promote the family as the foundation stone of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As evidence of its continued adaptability and relevance, the party exists today as a major political force in all states of Australia. It presently is a coalition partner in three state governments&mdash;New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia&mdash;and it is represented by three state deputy premiers. Its affiliate is in power in the Northern Territory; it is the senior coalition party in opposition in Queensland; and it has strong branch structures in South Australia and Tasmania. As a mark of its strength and its ability throughout the last 75 years, its influence and achievements have not only been immense but totally out of proportion to its numerical representation in both state and federal parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party is a truly democratic party. Its structure guarantees it represents the wishes of its members. It proudly has the largest membership of any political party in Australia, with 100,000 members and with over 1,400 branches all over Australia. Its strong state organisational structure provides participation by branch members and gives democratic grassroots control to its members and provides the party with its most marked and envied characteristic&mdash;its stability. The party also involves the participation of the Young Nationals and the Federal Women's Council, with the party being the first to have a woman as its national president and federal director. Today it proudly has a female federal director and national president of the Young Nationals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party may unashamedly have had its birth in regional Australia and may have always represented the non-metropolitan electorates, but it has always had a vision and influence to introduce measures that benefit all Australians. The National Party in power has been instrumental in a lengthy list of important changes that have been to the long-term benefit of all Australians. Following the securing of a coalition agreement in 1922, the National Party has for most of these ensuing years been part of a strong non-Labor coalition with its partner, the Liberal Party, and has provided a coalition government with a deputy prime minister for a total of over 46 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party in government has been instrumental in the establishment of the Reserve Bank, the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Primary Industry Bank of Australia. It introduced a national hospital medical benefits insurance scheme that ensured medical and hospital fees would never financially ruin any Australian family ever again, and there would always be a safety net in times of medical misfortune. It was instrumental in setting up the CSIRO and providing it with independent and unthreatening funding. As well, it strengthened Australia and its industries through the 200-mile Australian fishing zone and the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party introduced and guaranteed Commonwealth financial assistance for roads, plus the Australian bicentennial road development program; the Australian Institute of Sport; the Australian Trade Commission Service; Aussat; numerous trade agreements, notably with Japan, the Middle East, Korea and South-East Asia; cheaper international and innovative domestic airfare packages; Commonwealth assistance for regional aerodrome development; income equalisation deposits; the isolated children's assistance program and isolated patients travel and accommodation assistance program; national soil and water conservation programs; and the abolition of Commonwealth land, death and gift duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party has always acted in a constructive way to achieve its platform. It has always brought a practical focus to the issue and it has had an innovative impact on many institutions of Australian life. To sum up, it has been successful&mdash;and successful it will continue to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out by Malcolm Mackerras after the last federal election results, the National Party was the only major political party to increase its political representation at the last election. One measure of success is the many eminent National Party parliamentarians who have contributed in a monumental way over the years. The party has provided immense impact from leaders such Sir Earle Page, Sir Arthur Fadden, Sir John McEwen and, in more recent times, the troika&mdash;as they were known&mdash;of Doug Anthony, Peter Nixon and Ian Sinclair. All these leading members of the National Party provided Australia with strong leadership and with clear direction combined with personal qualities of integrity and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the enormous contribution that this party has made to this great nation which I wish to highlight today. The National Party is particularly remembered for the contributions it has made for all Australians through its vision and its toughness. One is reminded of the Japan agreement secured by McEwen in 1957, when Japan, through the treaty, was given some degree of preference in the Australian market in a bid to obtain a foothold in the expanding Japanese market. All this occurred a mere 12 years after the end of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was this far-sightedness that was instrumental in the foremost trading position Australia now holds with its important trading partner&mdash;Japan&mdash;and similarly with a renegotiated Ottawa agreement, which secured less British preference to our markets and more access to British markets for Australian exports, particularly wheat. This must be taken in the context of British-Australian relations in the 1950s and the UK application to join the European Community. This also was a far-sighted achievement. It is worth noting that in the 1960s Sir John warned of the effects on world trade that would follow from the members of the EC restricting access to Australian exports. On the eve of the implementation of the Uruguay Round of GATT, which has gone some way to remedying the distorting factors of massive EC subsidies, it is fitting to remember the wisdom of Sir John McEwen's criticism at that time. Politically speaking, he led the party into five general elections; the coalition won all five. He also made major contributions to the wool industry's effective marketing arrangements, the wheat board and the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look further back in history is to acknowledge the contributions of the first National Party coalition government&mdash;the Bruce-Page government. With the National Party holding the portfolios of Treasury and transport, this government played a major role in nation building. It introduced a central banking system, a cooperative system of collecting federal and state taxes, uniform bankruptcy laws, a national system of transport, the forerunner to the CSIRO, the Standards Association and the federal council of health. It even managed to win a constitutional referendum in 1927 to authorise the Commonwealth to make arrangements with the states for taking over debts and the payment of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party's second leader, Sir Earle Page, set a respected tradition, serving as leader for 18 years, as did his successor, Sir Arthur Fadden, who followed Archie Cameron in 1940. Sir John McEwen was then leader for 13 years, followed by Doug Anthony for a further 13 years. Party leader, Artie Fadden, like Page and McEwen, was also Prime Minister in his own right for 40 days and was Acting Prime Minister for a further 692 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Artie Fadden is particularly remembered for his term as Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister to the late Sir Robert Menzies from 1949-58. His influence in the 1940s and 1950s was comparable to that of Page in the 1920s and 1930s. Starting life as a billy boy for a cane cutting gang, he became a qualified accountant and, before entering state politics, had one of the largest accounting practices in North Queensland. He was considered an admirable Treasurer, delivering a record 11 budgets, and was able to skilfully deal with the rapid growth in the economy from the massive wool profits during the Korean War by working out the tax credit system to slow down their flow into the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 18 years with Fadden as leader of the party, the National Party continued its reliable and stable representation with Doug Anthony. To reflect on a more recent leader, Doug Anthony was Deputy Prime Minister to three Liberal Prime Ministers: Gorton, McMahon and Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doug Anthony made tremendous gains to secure the future of our rural industries. He was able to secure a minimum price scheme for wool when the volatility of the wool price was destabilising the industry. He also persisted with reforms to the dairy industry, dragging it out of its impoverished condition. He must be pleased with the position of the industry today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anthony was also a committed advocate of strong social and family values, on which he took a courageous stand. He displayed a common quality of the National Party: loyalty to the party and loyalty to its coalition partner. Loyalty and stability have been National Party qualities that the electorate has always been able to rely on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doug Anthony had a reputation for driving a hard bargain. The closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand stands as one of Doug Anthony's most important achievements. His contribution as trade minister has been to the long-term benefit of Australia with the opening up of trade to the middle east and his pivotal role in securing a new international sugar agreement which, had the European Community only been prepared to cooperate, could have set a pattern for all future international commodity marketing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even out of power, the National Party has fought strongly to maintain arrangements that enable our major export industries to remain profitable and competitive. It fought to maintain the sole export trading powers of the Wheat Board and for the reintroduction of the underwriting for the wheat industry. It fought for the sugar industry by means of continuation of the sugar tariff when the industry was a victim of the hugely unfair trading situation because of massive subsidies provided to our major competitors. It influenced the changes to our antidumping and countervailing systems. It ensured bipartisan support for landcare and the conservation of the Murray-Darling. It stopped the introduction of the Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it is alarming to note the measures this ALP government has removed from primary industry in the 12 years it has been in power. Rural people know that roads and petrol prices are their lifeblood and that a proper drought policy is essential. They must be able to plan in good seasons for the inevitable bad season. Since 1983, when it came to power, the Labor government has systematically removed drought planning incentives, removed immediate write-offs for expenditure on water conservation rebates, cut soil conservation funding, continually increased the excise on petrol and indexed it, abolished the income equalisation deposit scheme for six years, cut wool research promotion funding and increased export inspection charges and quarantine fees&mdash;all to the detriment of rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $167 million drought relief package announced last year, which only reintroduces some of these measures secured in the past by the National Party, is a belated contribution to a vital industry sector. By contrast, the Fraser-Anthony coalition government, with primary industry minister Peter Nixon, dealt with the crippling drought of 1983-84 in a way that enabled rural industries to lead the nation out of the recession of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you consider the vital importance of our road system to our continuing international competitiveness, you see that the government is doing a disservice to all future Australians by redirecting the petrol excise to the extent that it now does. In 1980 under the Fraser-Anthony coalition government, $925 million was collected in petrol excise of which 67.9 per cent went back to road funding. By 1988, the Labor government was taking 80 per cent of petrol excise for other purposes. This year only 8.8 per cent of the petrol excise will go to roads and a massive $9.641 billion will be collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, it is the needs of the silent majority of Australians in areas such as small business and traditional family and social values that are ignored by this Labor government. The National Party has always been the voice for small business, wherever it is found around Australia. Small business is an important component of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people know that the National Party will always take a strong and principled stand on issues that are related to social and family values. The runs are definitely on the board and the National Party is committed to its party beliefs of giving priority to policies that support the family as the foundation of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose today is to pay tribute to the National Party and its achievements and contributions to this nation over the past 75 years. From its foundation of representing rural and regional interests, it has blossomed into a party at both the state and the federal level that speaks for all Australians, their beliefs and aspirations. It is a party that I am proud to represent. Its past achievements and defined purpose and aims for the future will, without any doubt, see the National Party continue to play a major role in the long-term future of Australian political life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the appropriation bills dramatises one disastrous thing that was underlined just half an hour ago when Australia's worst ever monthly current account figure of $2.4 billion, seasonally adjusted, was announced by the Commonwealth statistician&mdash;the worst ever in Australia's history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say, `What does the current account deficit do to me?' What impact does it have on the pocket of ordinary Australians? The impact it has is that it destroys our economic recovery; it pushes up interest rates; it forces the government, reluctantly and at last, to take notice of the advice that has been given by the opposition, by leading economists and by basically anyone who knows anything about finance that last year's budget was a disaster and that we are revisiting yesterday's crises. This is a crisis and it is yesterday's crisis. We are repeating the problems of yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not extraordinary that it was said that Louis XVIII of France had forgotten nothing and learnt nothing? How appropriate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;I suppose one could call him the minister in charge of French empire clocks&mdash;should be in exactly the same situation. He has learnt nothing from the disasters he presided over as Treasurer. So here we have yesterday's Treasurer as Prime Minister repeating yesterday's mistakes. If anyone is yesterday's man, it is the present Prime Minister. He cannot escape from yesterday. He is repeating the disasters that brought about the last two recessions and in particular the last recession that he says we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the Prime Minister's closest former advisers was Dr Morgan, who is the husband of one of his former ministers, Mrs Kelly. Dr Morgan is now very senior in Westpac. Over two years ago, in fact almost 2 1/2 years ago, Dr Morgan wrote in a Westpac monthly document a very clear analysis of how the 1990-91 recession&mdash;that was the recession we had to have&mdash;came about. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main catalyst for the 1990-91 recession in Australia was the Government's imposition of high interest rates aimed at curbing rapid growth in domestic spending (primarily business investment).</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, whose government was it and who was the Treasurer? The government was the Hawke government; the Treasurer was Mr Keating. Dr Morgan says that the seeds had been sown by the Hawke government's mishandling of the recovery from the 1982-83 recession. Dr Morgan says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1982-83 recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which consistently has been blamed on the Fraser government&mdash;was caused by a combination of external and domestic factors . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: external&mdash;interest rate rises; changes in commodity situations; worldwide problems that were affecting Australia; and, of course, the worst drought for something like 60 years. But Dr Morgan says that `the 1990-91 recession' was caused `by purely domestic factors'. What are the factors causing the present disaster? They are domestic. They are as a result of this government's massive incompetence in the face of plenty of learned advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while Mr Keating, yesterday's Treasurer, was sowing the seeds by mishandling the recovery from the 1982-83 recession, there was all this advice about how to avoid such a problem. Dr Morgan also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . most of the gains in reducing inflation during the recession were lost in an over-rapid recovery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Incompetence, stupidity, a mistake being repeated again. As I said on 7 October 1992 in this place, that is exactly the sort of situation that Mr Keating is repeating right now. Dr Morgan had said that this mishandling by Mr Keating laid the groundwork for the spending boom, high inflation and large balance of payments problems in the late 1980s, so that, as Dr Morgan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . another recession, this time due only to national&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not international&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">problems, became inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in 1992, Mr Keating was trying to buy his way into power by excessively boosting the economy, trying to create jobs at the cost of tomorrow's jobs. We have the same situation now. The statement that came out yesterday boasted about the remarkable and very speedy improvement in the jobs situation. But the way it has been effected condemns people tomorrow to mounting unemployment&mdash;just as happened in the 1990-91 recession. It is a repetition of exactly what happened before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More warnings from experts nowadays continue on the same sort of front; in fact, they started when this government brought out its incompetent budget in May of last year. I noticed a couple of years ago that Mr Argus, the Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank, said that Australia could not afford the government's unfunded tax cuts&mdash;which it was offering at that time to buy its way into power, by the way&mdash;because they would overstimulate the economy, leading to a blow-out in Australia's foreign debt. That remark was prescient; it was made back in October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government took no notice of Mr Argus&mdash;he did not know what he was talking about! But, of course, Mr Keating did. Mr Keating knows all. He knows all about yesterday's mistakes because he is the expert at repeating them: yesterday's man repeating yesterday's mistakes and pushing Australia back into yesterday's recession, with the worst ever balance of payments figures ever recorded in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is intriguing is the continuing pressure on spending by this government itself. We in the opposition have continually said that the government must cut its spending, that public sector spending must not continue to be the added stimulus to the excessive growth which is causing serious problems, because of the government's incompetence, and pushing us back into being threatened with serious recession. But the government says, `Oh no, we can't cut spending; it is sacrosanct.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what Dr Morgan said in 1992. He said that public sector spending was too high. In the budget of that year, it was government spending that was pushing the economy along. The budget papers say, `Public sector final demand will continue to support activity in 1992-93.' Yet what is happening this year? Public sector expenditure is up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intriguing to note that, in the revised statements in yesterday's announcement by the Treasurer, Mr Willis, there is no comment about any variation in public sector spending. Yet in the budget papers, we see quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Public final demand</EMPHASIS> is expected to make a larger contribution to GDP growth in 1994-95 than in recent years reflecting an increase in underlying public investment.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the government up to? Here it is threatening to take serious fiscal measures&mdash;in other words, increase taxes&mdash;in order to slow down this expansion which is causing such disastrous problems in our debt situation, but it is not prepared to do anything about its own excessive spending&mdash;spending that has been a major factor in increased demand in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite fascinating to go back and have a good look at last year's budget forecasts to see how extraordinary and wrong they were and how ludicrous it is for anyone in this country to take any notice of any economic promise, forecast or what have you given by yesterday's Treasurer, the man who, to my knowledge, has been wrong on all these matters more than any other Australian. Wrong, wrong, wrong, Mr Keating, and you are going to be wrong again and are being proved wrong by what is happening at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers said, `The current account deficit is forecast to increase moderately in 1994-95.' What is the reality? The reality is that it is going to burst out to $26 billion, which is almost six per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have key forecasts, one of which was: the balance of payments deficit is forecast to increase moderately in 1994-95, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP. That forecast is absolute nonsense. Let us have a look at another forecast. The budget papers said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Monetary policy will need to continue to focus on maintaining low inflation through the medium term&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the government was saying, `We are going to put your interest rates up.' Let us concede that.

It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while the Government's deficit reduction strategy will be crucial in boosting national saving, minimising interest rate pressures as business investment recovers and establishing scope for future fiscal flexibility.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With further significant falls in world interest rates unlikely, given recent developments in the US, a modest increase in the net income deficit is projected for 1994-95 as the impact of a continued rise in the stock of foreign debt again begins to dominate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This is, of course, despite the fact that in recent times we have had a significant appreciation of the Australian dollar against the American dollar. That appreciation is now being hit severely on the head. These foreign debt figures are based on a level of the Australian dollar that is probably too high in context of the sorts of judgments that the rest of the world is going to make about us. Last year's budget stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strategy to increase national savings is in place, enabling the impending recovery in business investment to be financed without excessive reliance on foreign savings and so preserving sound prospects for stabilising external debt as a proportion of GDP in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA>Have you ever heard such nonsense? We now have in the same budget year the worst ever quarterly current account deficit figure. It is around $6.6 billion for the December quarter and follows the September quarter record worst ever figure. We have this situation at a time when the government is telling the Australian people that there will not be an excessive reliance on foreign savings. I wonder what the meaning of `excessive' is. I suppose we can believe that comment just as we can believe the Prime Minister's comment that tax cuts are l-a-w, law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot believe a word this government says. It will do or say anything to buy its way into power. Once again, in the area of unemployment, it is buying jobs that it knows it cannot sustain. It is getting the unemployment figures down by putting Australia further and further into debt. It is not cutting its own spending. It is giving false hope to those Australians who have been able to get unemployment benefits and it is imposing a dreadful threat on all those Australians who have jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present situation excessive measures are going to have to be taken and the government admits that it is going to have to take fiscal measures. It is too late. Had it taken them at the time and had it followed the advice of the opposition, Australia would not be facing this kind of crisis. I do not expect we will get an apology from this Prime Minister. He does not know how to say sorry, just as he does not know how to be right. The budget paper stated:</PARA>

<PARA>that was the policy task, but it has failed with its policy again&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Where are these structural reforms? What has happened to them? They are all falling apart. The government is not proceeding with the sorts of structural reforms that are absolutely vital and which the opposition has been pressing for years. The budget paper stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All areas of policy&mdash;fiscal, monetary and structural&mdash;have a role to play in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>We have not seen enough of the `structural' and we have seen nothing of the `fiscal' that is now being waved over the head of Australians. It goes on:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation bills are not often questioned in this place. The last time was in 1991. It is probably an outcome of the two-party system which either mindlessly supports or mindlessly opposes. Since appropriation bills are supply bills in the classic sense, they are usually passed without question unless someone is trying to block supply. There is no reason for this. Appropriation bills are bills, the same as other bills. They are not inviolate or on some pedestal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution does not say that appropriation bills cannot be altered. In fact, it specifies that the Senate cannot alter them but can send them back to the House of Representatives with a request for alteration. There have been many instances where recommendations for amendments have been put up and debated in the Senate. Appropriation bills, like any bills, should be subject to review and change. We will therefore put to the Senate a request for amendment to the House of Representatives in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent of the change is to eliminate the $215 million sought by Defence mainly for new equipment. The reason for this unbudgeted expenditure has not been adequately explained. It is a large sum&mdash;16 per cent greater than the entire annual budget for environmental protection, parks and the national estate. It is basically an issue of proper process. Why is there this unexpected sudden massive increase in the need for equipment? If it was expected, then why was it not included in the normal budget in Appropriation Bill (No. 1)? What reprogramming of payments is involved? If they are payments that were not made last year and were known to come due this year, why were they not included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1)? If they are payments that were planned for future years, why are they needed now? If they are for new equipment, what new equipment are they for? Why and how is this demand for new equipment justified? What urgency is involved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other departments justify additional expenses. In the additional appropriation bills before us, there is the money for drought relief, rural restructuring and jobs programs. These are clear issues that are obviously results of decisions made in this place. They are commitments that involve an additional expense not budgeted for. There are other expenses, including the veterans' health care cost resulting from the shutdown of public institutions. They can be seen as expenses that should have been calculated in the savings from privatisation but were not calculated for political and ideological reasons or as a consequence of incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still, the nature of the expenses is specified and it is clear that the failure to provide the funds will result in hardship for veterans who had no part in the decisions to shut down facilities they were using. There is no such clear rationale for a group giving a quarter of a billion dollars to Defence for war toys. While Defence has specified what it wants the money for, there is no reason given for failure to include it in the normal budget, nor is there any exceptional event creating the need. Only the administrative division expenses have some justification, since without funding some non-defence group or the general community will have to carry the can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence has held a privileged position in the sense that it has been allowed to determine what it wants and then been given it. It really justifies anything. Questions are deflected by claims of national security. It operates under a global budget and the kindest description of processes of accountability is that they are opaque. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence operates on a huge budget, yet answers to questions about expenditure are often deliberately obscure and sometimes blocked completely. I recently received answers to many pages of questions. I will tell my fellow senators some of the answers so that they can understand something of my frustration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the defence exports inquiry, we were told that Customs does almost no checking of arms exports and generally would not know if what is going out is what is described on the manifest. The committee, both in the primary and additional reports, rightly directed intense criticism at this practice. We were told that Customs depends almost entirely on information gathered by military intelligence to stop arms smuggling and illegal arms exports. We were told that this is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a few questions about this. I am the last person who would want to compromise anything working to stop illegal arms transfers. I asked good general questions just to get some idea of what intelligence actually does and whether the money we give it is being used well. I asked how many illegal trade events have been detected and how many times intelligence has informed Customs of a potential problem. I asked whether intelligence cooperates with other nations and international intelligence agencies in monitoring legal and illegal arms transfers. They were good, basic questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told that it is policy never to answer any questions about intelligence. This is not about security. There are no security issues here except the question of whether there is adequate security against illegal arms trading. This is an issue of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people were given $130 million last year. That is more than two and a half times what was given to rural adjustment and services. Surely we have some right to ask whether it is doing any good. My questions were entirely non-specific. Nothing about intelligence methods would have been revealed except to give some idea of whether they are doing the job for which they are given funding. The only reason I can imagine for stonewalling on such answers is that they are not doing a good job and that the answers would have been dramatically embarrassing&mdash;too much so for even this place to tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked several pointed questions about the minehunter project. I did not question the need for an anti-mine capability. I would just like some assurance that this project will not be a repeat of the inshore minehunter fiasco, which was terminated after it was recognised that the ships being built were hardly seaworthy in a bath tub and were useless in even a light breeze under real conditions. Yet we spent $150 million building exactly two of the useless things before the program was shut down after revelations of the total stupidity and waste involved. I cannot see how even the most devout arms advocate would accept such expenditures for ships that cannot be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most expensive part of a minehunter is the sonar telecommunications component. In the case of the new ships, we have opted for another gee-whiz, high-tech model of questionable value. These techno toys not only are initially much more expensive but also cost more to maintain. The costs blow out rapidly if there are any problems. Problems are much more likely since they have not been routinely adapted to many and varied environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry is that this part of the minehunter project will be a liability rather than an asset, so I asked several questions relating to both the cost and the consideration of potential problems and the need for exotic rather than standard minehunting hardware. This was not an ideological rejection of defence expenditure but an effort to ensure economic responsibility. The rationale for this high-tech variable debt system is that it is good for defence against ultra-sophisticated underwater mines. They were used by the USSR in Europe, and the technology was developed against them for use in the Baltic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are questions about whether their technology can be adapted easily and reliably to tropical waters, which experience large temperature variations. The instruments are extremely sensitive to temperature. The Baltic has a very even temperature gradient. Defence experts estimate that the potential cost of modifying this equipment to tropical conditions could blow out the MHC budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of this, I asked some questions about the need for this technology. We are not in the Baltic. We are not operating subs in an enclosed sea. We do not have neighbouring nations also bordering a sea in a way that endangers our movement in and out. Coastal areas where subs will be based, such as Garden Island, are often relatively shallow. Control of the surrounding sea is relatively easy. Who do we imagine might mine the Fremantle harbour area? Who will mine Sydney? How would they do so undetected? As far as I know, none of the regional powers have anything like the Russian deep sea mines or would have the capability of mining our harbour areas undetected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the location and topography of proposed sub-bases it is very likely that we could establish multiple passage areas around submarine bases, monitor them and keep them mine-free using cheaper, proven and more reliable equipment. The Department of Defence did answer that Garden Island is too shallow for such mines, and it is not considered likely that they would be used elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked some questions about the cost of the variable depth system and the need for it. I got answers that could only be described as contrary and evasive. I asked if any neighbouring nations held such mines and was asked in turn to specify which neighbour. Why? It was a general question in relation to the need for expenditure. Surely if this special equipment is required, the Department of Defence knows whether any neighbours have such mines and can tell me which ones. I asked if any potential enemy had such mines, thinking maybe some non-neighbour was the problem. It was not an adequate answer to say `We do not designate countries as potential enemies.' This is evasion. `Potential' means possible. The dictionary defines it as `latent, that may or might but does not now exist or act.' I did not need to know who was considered a potential enemy, just whether such an enemy existed. So there is no diplomatic problem in answering that question. If we have no potential enemies we do not need a defence force at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These kinds of answers to questions on notice in estimates committees are simply not adequate. They are irresponsible, evasive and anti-accountable. They tie the questions up in bureaucratic jargon and refuse to respond to the clear concerns raised. In such a case I cannot condone giving more money to Defence. They have received the money they asked for in the budget. They have shown no reason for additional expenditure outside the normal budget process. I see no urgency here. They can wait for next year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go into some detail about the minehunters and mines because the quality of answers I received is indicative of the reason I cannot support this Defence appropriation. I also mention it because at least $90 million of the amount sought is for the minehunters. I note that in the annual report there is a little net underspending on equipment, some $66 million. But this masked the fact that there was actually an underspending of $185 million on the minehunter project to be rolled over to this year while there was additional spending in a number of areas like Anzac frigates, Raven Radios and so on to the level of about $123 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence seems to be one of the most heavily padded budgets in the Commonwealth. Until I start seeing some real justification of expenditure, scrutiny of performance and cooperation in answering questions I cannot agree to additional expenditure beyond that covered in the budget and will continue to push for more accountability within the budget process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other non-defence aspects of this bill fall clearly into the area of additional appropriation. The need for funds for veterans' affairs or human services reflects real needs that will create hardships if not met. So does the housing component of the Defence request. So I have not asked for that to be excluded. Otherwise I do not see any evidence of urgency or hardship or unexpected expense in relation to defence. I do not see any danger in waiting until next year's budget. I cannot see why, when the people of both sides of this house call for fiscal restraint and are concerned about the current account, we should spend a quarter of a billion dollars extra on defence. I believe that there are significant ways Defence could save money or use it more wisely. The Institute of Public Affairs, hardly a radical group, agreed. Let Defence do what other departments do, what Health, Social Security and Environment do, and find ways to internally adjust for increased expenses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza claims that I need to give examples. He obviously has not been listening to the last ten minutes of my speech because I gave him several. I think it is more a problem of closing ones's ears rather than wanting to hear what was going on. Items such as those here, and I will use the P3C component&mdash;another $96 million expenditure&mdash;may actually be acceptable and a good idea. I understand that these will improve safety and surveillance ability. My point is that it is not urgent. It is not something that arose unexpectedly. I understand that the P3C Orion technology has been a problem for some time and that the technical upgrades have been examined for some time. So why is it not included in the budget? Why was it not included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1)? Why can it not wait for the next budget, which is only a few months off?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unaccountability. It is a way of making the Defence budget appear lower than it is. Defence puts in a submission, leaves off the P3C, leaves off the minehunter costs and then comes in and says, `Oh, there is an additional demand we didn't know about. We need another $200 million.' It expects simply to get it. This is not good enough. No other federal department would get away with it, and Defence should not get away with it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, we have excluded the bulk of the Defence request. Let it put it in next year's budget in an above board manner. Let it know that it cannot simply forget to mention a couple of hundred million dollars that it wants and then ask for it later in the full expectation that it will get it. Defence makes long range procurement plans&mdash;we know that because it gives them to industry, not necessarily us&mdash;and these should be reflected in a minimal request for additional money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have left two areas of the request stand. The request for $12 million for housing should have been foreseen, but housing has been low priority in Defence and housing stocks have been run down. It is only because of adverse publicity that something is now being done. We think that upgrading housing should be supported because it is a case of imposing hardship if it is not done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I would like to point out that there is considerable need for public housing upgrades, yet on page 44 of this bill the entire additional appropriation for housing and crisis accommodation is only $300,000. This is for the first home owners scheme, incidental expenditure for a scheme being terminated. Yet the Department of Defence claims it suddenly and unexpectedly needs $12 million for Defence housing. Can it really be the case that Defence did not know it needed to fix up housing, or is this just evidence that it was not going to and has changed its mind because the dreadful state of housing was publicly revealed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point out another disjunction, which is that the total amount housing and regional affairs got in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) was $1.6 million. This is to deal with the need for crisis accommodation and general public housing. Less than $2 million was considered to be all the nation needed or could afford, and yet volunteer welfare agencies are complaining about heavy loads of the poor and homeless. By contrast, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) has already given the Department of Defence $332 million for defence housing this year. It needs another $12 million. Something is wrong here. There is a problem with priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other request of the Department of Defence that we accepted was the administrative component. This was for clearing unexploded ordnance, paying compensation claims and settling underpayments to Aboriginal soldiers who served in World War II. Why this was not settled long ago I cannot imagine, and why this is an unexpected expense I do not know. But if the Commonwealth will finally pay these people the Greens will support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that $11,000 was appropriated for payments in 1992-93 and they were not made. I note that the expenditure for 1993-94 is listed as nil on page 27, yet I believe $20,000 was appropriated&mdash;$11,000 as budgeted and an extra $9,000 that was in additional appropriations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) this year included $10,000 for this purpose, and we see yet another $4,000 in additional appropriations. Why this additional sum, I am not sure. It was World War II and we ought to know what we owe. I expect to see an expenditure as a result of this. These are servicemen who are now becoming old. Year after year money is appropriated and not paid. Please pay them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we must demand a level of accountability from Defence at least equal to that of other departments. It is not good enough that it is a law unto itself. The rule for Defence cannot simply be `ask and you shall receive'. For this reason, I commend my recommendation for amendment to the Senate. A saving of $200 million today would be timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to add that for any party to be credible in terms of accountability&mdash;the opposition often claims to be concerned about accountability&mdash;it must also look at accountability for Defence spending. It is not about ideology; it is not about whether you support defence or not; it is about whether you support accountability and whether you let a defence department off the hook simply because it is defence and not social security or any other department spending money from the Commonwealth's budget. </PARA>

It gives us an opportunity each year to do an assessment of the government's performance and how this nation is travelling without necessarily going into a lot of detail.

They have gone up significantly and are likely to go up more. In fact, we can almost guarantee they will go up more. There has also been an alarming drop in housing investment. Probably even more important than any of these things is the fact that confidence is once again disappearing from the business community.

Without confidence, you will not get the types of consistent levels of investment that are required to have an economy consistently performing well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been extremely lacking during the whole period of the Hawke-Keating and Hawke-come-Keating governments is consistency in economic performance. We have consistently had a boom-bust scenario. Either growth has been out of control, unemployment has been out of control, our foreign debt has been out of control or our current account has been out of control. According to predictions, the figures coming out today&mdash;I have not seen the figures but the predictions probably will be right&mdash;are expected to show a record blow-out for the current account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There must have been a number of people like myself who returned from their holidays over Christmas and were shocked to read in the newspapers last week of the death of Dr Grisha Sklovsky. We would have wanted to have the opportunity to join the some 450 people who paid tribute to Grisha, who died peacefully on 9 January this year aged 79. My colleague Senator Short, the shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, who is in the chamber with me today, would also like to join me in these remarks. I know that Dr Sklovsky was a source of wise counsel to Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obituaries in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspapers were appropriately extensive. Grisha Sklovsky had a wide range of friends from science, business, the arts, politics and education. I was proud to count myself among his friends. I first met Grisha when I was a very young child. At that stage he had just come to Australia, and he often played tennis with my parents following his migration to this country in 1947. During the 1980s, Grisha kept in touch with me through his interests in the Institute of Public Affairs. His involvement with multicultural activities brought him into contact with my wife, who was employed at the Special Broadcasting Service. Grisha, as senators will know, was the foundation chairman of SBS from 1978 to 1980.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a mark of the great respect held for Grisha Sklovsky that three most eminent Australians spoke at his memorial service, which was held at the Camberwell Town Hall on 11 January. Sir Zelman Cowan, former Governor-General, spoke of Grisha's involvement with the Institute of International Affairs and of his lively concern for international affairs and relations. Among other things, Sir Zelman mentioned Grisha's extraordinary network of friends, his style, his zest and his enthusiasm for life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Phillip Law, the noted Antarctic explorer, mentioned Grisha's wide range of interests which, of course, included helping to establish SBS, his involvement in Antarctic expeditions, and his service on many cultural organisations. Phillip Law said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His value to the community, first recognised by his election to the Royal Council of Victoria in 1967, spread through many areas. From 1975-77 Grisha was President of the Australian Institute of International Affairs; in 1987 he was elected president of the RSV for three years, and in 1994 he accepted the position of inaugural chairman of the advisory board of the Institute of Reproduction and Development at Monash University.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to hear that the institute will be setting up a postgraduate scholarship to honour Grisha Sklovsky's memory. Sir Gustav Nossal, recently announced as Australian of the Year and one of our most distinguished scientists, spoke of Grisha's rich professional life both before and after his work at ICI, and the recognition he received by receiving the Order of Australia award. This week the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia/Israel Review</EMPHASIS> wrote these words to describe Grisha Sklovsky: `his intellectual breadth and rigour, his vision, and dedication to multiculturalism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grisha Sklovsky's early life was marked by huge change and upheaval as some of the tragic events of the 20th century shaped his early experiences. In his own words he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was my fifth start in settling anywhere in a community. Yet it is the first country and place where I have felt welcome and free and at home.</PARA>
<PARA>Grisha summed up his early years in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Escaping oppression in Russia aged 8, and, on completing school, in Hitler's Germany; pre-War University years in France as a welcome paying guest as long as I did not have to earn a living there. Free Czech Army Service in Wartime England and Europe made it impossible to obtain even a visitors entree to post-war England. It seemed, in 1945, unsafe and unwise to remain in Free Czechoslovakia after 6 years of Army service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since I was 9, I dreamt of life in the New World. I fell in love with a Melbourne girl in France just before the War started. We managed to remain in contact, and married as Australian Red Cross Officers in Greece in 1946; and I arrived here in 1947, delayed by only 23 years.</PARA>
<PARA>In the last two months, I met Grisha twice. The first occasion was at a conference held jointly by the Australian Defence Association and the Institute of International Affairs. The conference concerned Australia's role in peacekeeping. He was, as ever, an active participant. I saw him again in November. He telephoned me and said that he would like to have a discussion about some political issues. We spent well over an hour together in my office and we covered a wide range of matters. An article had appeared that day in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on his son Michael, and this led to a very enjoyable exchange on family matters. He was enormously proud of his family and I was able to catch up with all the activities of Celia, his children and grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He handed me a speech on Australian citizenship which he had made a number of years ago which covered many of his attitudes to Australia and multiculturalism. He felt this speech was still relevant today. He was a passionate Australian&mdash;a passion reinforced by his knowledge of how other societies functioned. He greatly appreciated the openness and tolerance of Australian society which, in his view, made us a unique community. I would like to quote from that speech he gave me on this issue. Grisha Sklovsky said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Never did so many people of different, at times hostile  backgrounds, move with so little friction or conflict into a new host society. No host society accepted a sudden influx of so many foreigners so readily. This does not mean that Australia became an instant paradise, nor that all newcomers or inmates became instant angels. But here we created and maintained a way of life the like of which none of our Home Countries ever achieved. Of course there is room for improvements, but the general level of racial, religious and general tolerance is quite outstanding in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grisha, however, was critical of what he saw was a lack of national pride. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems very sad to me that all Australian Governments have tolerated in the past 15 years a manifest devaluation of national pride, radical approach to our government system, to our flag, without any attempt to revalue Australian Citizenship, or to raise incentives for residents to become citizens. People should be clamouring to be accepted into the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>Grisha Sklovsky was one of Australia's leading advocates of multiculturalism. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is one of the oldest democracies in the world. Australia is one of the very few countries whose Governments enable newcomers to remain active in their original ethnic groups, while being 1st class citizens here. We tend to take this for granted, forgetting that this is not so elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet Grisha believed it was important that new Australians should reach out to the wider community. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that having accepted the privilege of becoming Australians, we should reciprocate by joining in activities beyond our past ethnic ties. We can do this by becoming active in wider areas of our choice, by reaching out more often to our Australian neighbours of all backgrounds, without conflict, with our religious or ethnic origins.</PARA>
<PARA>He was a pioneer of multiculturalism, yet he had some concerns about recent developments. Grisha pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerable bureaucracies now exist, a whole ethnic industry. Many are useful, but there can be too much of a good thing. It is my belief that we need to review all this, to reduce the US and THEM gap from both sides, and concentrate on real needs while reducing self-serving groups.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table the full text of Grisha Sklovsky's speech on citizenship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Grisha Sklovsky was a great Australian. His life experience meant that he could appreciate, in a way not open to most of us, the reality of a free society.

We send our condolences to his wife Celia, his daughters Anna and Jane, his son Michael and his grandchildren.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I raise the matter of the inquiry by a Senate committee into Australian soccer. This is a very serious matter because it involves the question of large amounts of money going astray to the detriment of the game and to the detriment of the reputations of many people in the game. It also raises serious questions about the propriety of the actions of some people. The inquiry is being carried out by the Senate Environment, Recreation and the Arts References Committee. The Committee has already had one series of hearings at which some very serious allegations were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose here today is not to canvass the outcome of that hearing but to respond to some matters that have been raised in relation to me. It is also to commend the Australian Soccer Federation for an action that I understand it is taking today. As I understand it, the federation is recommending in a press release that players and officials&mdash;in fact, anyone involved&mdash;should give evidence to the Senate committee. In other words, it is getting totally behind the Senate committee and encouraging anyone with any knowledge to come forward, to reveal to the Senate inquiry whatever they know about impropriety relating to soccer&mdash;in particular, transfers, transfer payments, money gone astray and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand from evidence given to Mr Stewart in his inquiry into these matters that players had been stood over and threatened in respect of giving evidence to him. Now, hopefully, people will come forward to the Senate inquiry. The ASF, as I understand it, is going to assure players that they have nothing to fear by way of retribution if they come forward and give evidence freely and fully to the Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I think many people would be aware, the Senate inquiry is very soundly based on several grounds. In the first place, the federal government provides something like $1 1/2 million in taxpayers' funds to assist soccer football in Australia in one way or another&mdash;apart from whatever taxpayers' funds are provided at state level. It is essential that before taxpayers' money is contributed to a sport there should be no question about the integrity of its administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what will emerge from the Senate inquiry is that some people, I hope, will be given a totally clean bill of health and others who are demonstrated to have been involved in improper behaviour will be cleared out of their roles in soccer. Some people appear, on the evidence so far presented to the Stewart inquiry, to have been interested and involved in providing even greater benefits to themselves than to soccer football, no matter over how many years that had taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate inquiry also has enabled the Stewart inquiry into impropriety in soccer to be made public. Those people who were criticised, who were found to have behaved in an improper way, by former Justice Stewart in his report, which was commissioned by the Australian Soccer Federation itself, will have the chance before the Senate inquiry to answer those allegations, either in writing or by appearing in person. In other words, it puts an end to the leaks, innuendo and claims of cover-up that were involved when the Stewart inquiry report was not capable of being released because of legal advice that it was defamatory. That was why the Australian Soccer Federation could not release it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague from Western Australia who initiated this, Senator Ian Campbell, is only too well aware of the reasons that the Australian Soccer Federation could not release the report. In fact, he had discussions with the Soccer Federation before initiating the call for a Senate inquiry to,  if you like, complete the circle which was unable to be completed because of these matters&mdash;particularly, I might say, the failure of the Stewart inquiry to be able to overcome the threats made to various people not to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By having this Senate inquiry we have now made this report public. Instead of relying on innuendo and rumour, people can now see what is said about them. They have the right and it is the Senate committee's duty to give them the opportunity to give their side of the story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to stress that the threat of retribution against witnesses is a very serious matter. That is why I am so glad to see the Australian Soccer Federation getting behind our inquiry. I am glad to be a member of that inquiry, as is Senator Abetz, who I see is in the chamber today. This is a big matter. We have already established from the Stewart inquiry that in five transfers alone something like $1.2 million dollars has magically disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of retribution is a matter of concern. Our committee did hear evidence that the Chief Executive of the Australian Soccer Federation, Mr Ian Holmes, had been subjected to threats about the provision of evidence to the Stewart inquiry. In fact, he was accused of leaking evidence to the Stewart inquiry. The Stewart inquiry was set up by the Australian Soccer Federation. Here you have an allegation that a man who was a commissioner of the Australian Soccer Federation was accusing the paid chief executive of the Soccer Federation of leaking to that inquiry when he provided it with information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this is a matter of immense concern. We understand the Soccer Federation is very concerned that this kind of attitude appeared to exist among not only at least a commissioner of the ASF but also among some officials and coaches. Clearly, there is a problem. I certainly was on the receiving end of that problem when I saw a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 14 December, across five columns, saying, `Get it right, Senator,' in which Mr Anthony Labbozzetta, the Chairman of Marconi, criticised, in fact, attacked me for being wrong. I will quote some extracts from that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Marconi president says that Senator Baume has clearly mislead the public, parliament and the media. "He (Baume) has made certain allegations under parliamentary privilege and I want an apology."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume says in the Senate Hansard that Labbozzetta resigned as a director of the Australian Soccer Federation and identified a person as his brother as having links with the South Australia firm, Sea Travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labbozzetta said that at no time did he ever resign from the federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I sought leave of absence while the inquiry went ahead," he said. The statements he (Baume) has made are totally inaccurate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then he went on about how there was someone else called Francesco Nicola Labbozzetta who was involved with that company and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It is simply staggering to think that a man (Baume) of such high standing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I have to agree with that bit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has not done his homework correctly and has used parliamentary privilege to the detriment of people. I believe that is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the article ended saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labbozzetta is so incensed with the Senate Hansard that he has written to Ms Janice Crosio, the Federal member for Prospect, and also to Federal Immigration Minister Mr Nick Bolkus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Nick Bolkus, of course, has achieved some fame by reappointing Mr Labbozzetta to the Immigration Review Tribunal despite the fact that Mr Labbozzetta managed to sit on an average of one inquiry a year during the four-year period or so that he was on it. Despite a recommendation that he not be reappointed, Senator Bolkus reappointed him. Of course, Senator Short has pointed all that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allegations are just total and absolute nonsense. They are backed up by a letter to the President of the Senate from Tony Labbozzetta in which he repeats those allegations, saying that I am wrong. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senator has said that I have resigned during the year. This is untrue.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me quote exactly what I did say&mdash;this in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 7 December 1994. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the annual report of the Soccer Federation for 1993 reveals that. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It deals with Mr Constantine. I then went on with another matter. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a director of the federation, Mr Tony Labbozzetta, who resigned during the year, has an interest as a partner in the business Marconi Travel.</PARA>
<PARA>Notice that I said, `who resigned during the year, has an interest as a partner in the business Marconi Travel.' I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This business renders service in connection with travel arrangements for the federation in respect of interstate and international travel. All dealings with the business are in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms and conditions. Moneys paid to Marconi Travel during the year in respect of travel arrangements amounted to $129,246.</PARA>
<PARA>Where did I quote that from? From the annual report of the Australian Soccer Federation; it is here in Mr Labbozzetta's own federation's annual report. It is as clear as crystal, unless someone is seeking deliberately to misinterpret what I have said. I was reading exactly from that report. It is under the paragraph that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the annual report of the Soccer Federation for 1993 reveals that . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Labbozzetta knows perfectly well that that is chapter and verse what is in the report, and he knows perfectly well he resigned in that year. Whether or not he subsequently resigned or whether he just stood down, or whatever, is beside the point. I object to someone of Mr Labbozzetta's standing accusing me of lying when I read from an annual report of the body of which he was a member. It is to be noted that Labbozzetta said that at no time did he resign from the federation. That, not to put too fine a point on it, is simply false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to prejudge Mr Labbozzetta, just as I am certain Mr Labbozzetta does not want to prejudge the Senate committee. All I suggest to Mr Labbozzetta is that, if he has concerns and complaints to make, the place to make them is in front of the Senate committee. I might add that at no stage did I say that Francesco Labbozzetta was his brother, Frank. I do know how loosely the Labbozzetta family interprets the word `family' in these circumstances. I thought one's cousin was family, but I am not quite certain in which area of Italy the word `family' develops different meanings. The fact is that I had said that some members of the Labbozzetta family, particularly Francesco, who was involved with the Marconi Travel company, have been the subject of an internal police confidential inquiry. I have that document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Labbozzetta has concerns about it, as I said, let him present them to the Senate inquiry. I am quite prepared to hear them, but I am not prepared to have Mr Labbozzetta falsely pretend to the President of this place that I have improperly and disgracefully maligned him by quoting from the annual report of the Australian Soccer Federation. The President has kindly suggested that I should examine the claims herein and consider whether they require further clarification by me in the Senate. I thank the President for giving me that opportunity. All I seek is the truth and I would be very grateful indeed if Mr Labbozzetta could show the same enthusiastic pursuit as I have for the truth in this soccer matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, we need to reject the simplistic definition of this debate being about heritage values and trees. There is another important dynamic in this whole debate, and that is the people: the families and the communities which are affected by these on again, off again decisions whilst the Labor Party is trying to work out whether it is going to be the Green party or whether it is going to be the party for the workers, for whom it was founded some considerable time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most unfortunate that, in this whole debate, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens have not been able to  grasp the important dynamic of human involvement in their decision making processes. I congratulate those who are outside this place for having shown the very significant human element that is affected by the Labor Party's decision and its pursuit of the green agenda without regard for those who used to be its constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all of us in this place know, regional Australia is hurting badly because of the drought, high interest rates and the substantial lack of job opportunities within those areas. On top of that, the government has now thrown one of the important industries of regional Australia into absolute chaos as a result of its policy schizophrenia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner indicated to us that he recommended that 1,300 coupes be preserved because of their important conservation value. In writing to his ministerial colleague&mdash;I use the description `colleague' loosely; I would have thought he is an archenemy&mdash;the Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall, on 7 December 1994, submitting the first instalment of his forest preservation list, Senator Faulkner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In preparing my advice I have been rigorous in identifying forests of high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, after this rigorous examination there were 1,300 coupes. Suddenly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) intervened and the 1,300 coupes have been reduced to 509 coupes. One wonders how rigorous the examination really was when 791 coupes can be simply crossed out at a stroke of the Prime Minister's pen, especially when the Prime Minister said publicly that, before Christmas, the green movement would have been satisfied with 200 or 230 coupes. After Christmas, the number of coupes suddenly became 509, and we are now led to believe that 17 coupes in New South Wales may be put back on the list. Senator Faulkner told us that this is as a result of a rigorous examination!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I asked two questions about the situation. I asked what scientific basis there is for detailing these coupes, and I asked the whereabouts of the scientific evidence. There has been no satisfactory information brought forward to this place in any shape or form. Senator Faulkner indicated in this place, and to the people of Australia, that conservation groups have been consulted. How biased can he get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that a rigorous examination is an examination conducted by an independent person or an independent group of people who would cast a rational eye across all the coupes and determine, on a proper scientific basis, which ones will be preserved. But no, it was only the conservation groups. To assist the conservation groups, Senator Faulkner and his government&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;provided funding to the tune of $120,000 to assist them in making that rigorous examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting; that investigation took seven weeks to consider which coupes were of high conservation value. How long is seven weeks? It is 49 days. Within that 49 days, they recommended 1,300 coupes. They were therefore recommending roughly 26 coupes per day or more than one per hour if they were working seven days a week, 24 hours a day. If there is one thing we know about the green and conservation movements, it is that they do not know what hard work is. I would have thought that it would be highly unlikely that they would have worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for that full seven-week period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they spent one hour per coupe and we are to believe, according to the minister, that it was a rigorous examination. I would suggest to senators rather that it was a farcical examination. Indeed, if we divide the $120,000 that they were given to look at all these coupes, we would find that they spent approximately $100 per coupe. It would not have even paid for all the petrol if they actually drove to the coupes, examined them and made a proper determination. One does suspect that they were sitting in offices and made their determinations by writing with pen on paper and not on the basis of a proper examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those interesting statistics that I have just mentioned do not take into account the possibility that they may have looked at other coupes that they then did not recommend. If that was the case, the $100 per coupe would be even less and the time spent per coupe would have been less than an hour per coupe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would suggest that when one analyses this very sorry history the examination undertaken by the minister and his department was not rigorous, as he has sought to assert to the people of Australia. Indeed, the Prime Minister could not have been convinced of that. Why did the Prime Minister with a stroke of a pen say to the minister for the environment, `Out of your 1,300, I am just going to strike out 791'? I would have thought that was a fairly devastating prime ministerial rebuttal for the minister for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia ought to be entitled to hear the truth about our resource heritage which is renewable in the resource industries and, in this case, in relation to the forest industries. There has been a lot of belly-aching as to what is happening to Australia's forests. Let us explode some of the myths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the World Bank published data that indicated that Australia, with a population of just 17 million, had 41 million hectares of closed forest. The aggregate area of closed forest for our neighbours such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and the two Koreas was 35 million hectares. Those countries, of course, have a total population of several hundred million and not the 17 million that we had. Yet we actually import wood products, including sawn wood, from the forests of those South-East Asian countries. If we lock up more of our forests, what will happen is that we will be importing even more timber from those South-East Asian countries and that will be affecting our balance of payments even more. We would then, of course, find our economy getting more and more out of kilter and suffering even higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data indicates that Australia has 2.5 hectares of forest per head of population, and that is the 12th highest ratio in the world and 5 1/2 times the world average but, in terms of product removal or forest removal, Australia's rate of 0.5 of a cubic metre a hectare is equal 13th lowest in the world. The world average is 1.4 cubic metres a hectare or 2.8 times the Australian rate. Given the data that I have just referred to, the idea that Australia has so little forest as to prevent any timber production is clearly a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge people to deal with the facts. Only 20 per cent of Australia's public forests are, in fact, available for logging. So we are only talking about 20 per cent of the total forests within Australia. Out of that 20 per cent, less than one per cent of that 20 per cent is logged and regenerated annually. Native forest harvesting is conducted in a very controlled way under state supervision in accordance with plans and codes that protect all forest values. Populations of native animals are safeguarded by retention of habitat trees, stream side reserves and wildlife corridors. We never get to hear about that from the Greens who continually seek to denigrate this great industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parts of the tree that are utilised by the paper industry and woodchips are those parts of the tree which generally are of too poor a quality to be used as sawlogs, and would otherwise be burned or simply wasted and left to rot. If harvesting were to cease in native forests completely, then hundreds of sawmill workers would lose their jobs and the country's import bill, of course, would skyrocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My home state of Tasmania relies very heavily on the timber industry. In general terms, one in seven of employed Tasmanians work within the timber industry or the satellite industries. We are continually reminded by the greens that we should develop specific world class industries and make a little niche market for ourselves. We in Tasmania have done that with Elphinstone Engineering which now exports timber equipment to the rest of the world. But where did it gain that experience? It was out of the Tasmanian forest, and without the Tasmanian timber industry there would be no Elphinstone Engineering on the east coast of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when we talk about the timber industry it is not simply just the forest that we are talking about&mdash;it is the people, their communities, their lives, and the satellite industries such as engineering which also provide employment. In that context of its importance to the state of Tasmania, it is noteworthy that, during this debate yesterday and so far today, the only people from Tasmania who have got to their feet have been Senator Bell&mdash;of course, we know where the Australian Democrats stand; and they make no bones about where they stand&mdash;Senator Brian Harradine, supporting the industry, and Tasmania's Liberal senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Tasmania have every right to ask: where are Tasmania's Labor senators on this issue? Where are they? Their silence has been absolutely deafening. At least Senator John Devereux had the decency to resign from the Labor Party, join the greens and get out of his policy schizophrenia which was to try to play both sides. He said, `I'm coming down on the greens' side.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party senators have a challenge, and that is to determine on which side of the debate they are going to fall. It was very interesting to read the first speech of Senator Shayne Murphy, a Labor senator from Tasmania, who waxed lyrical about his involvement in the timber workers union and how he fought for the workers and their lives, their families and their communities. Where has he been on this debate? There has not been a single word in this place. One would hope that he will get on his feet later on today, or some time during the course of the week, and tell the people of Australia where he stands. Is he one of those five who are prepared to resign from the Labor Party about this issue? The Australian Labor Party has sold short the timber industry, its workers, their families and their communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a little rough to talk about the economy being in a parlous or a perilous condition when you have a GDP increase running at 6.4 per cent at the moment and estimated at being 5 1/2 per cent over the full year as compared with 4 1/2 per cent in the original forecast. It is a bit difficult to regard it as perilous when you have an inflation rate currently running at just around two per cent and estimated to be no more than 3 1/4 for the whole year under the revised forecast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit rough to say the economy is in a perilous condition when you have unemployment falling very significantly to an expected 8 1/2 per cent out turn for the year. It is a little rough to say the economy is in a perilous condition when you have interest rates running at an historically overall very much lower level than has been the case at any time during the last 20 or 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little rough in particular for an opposition to be making these sorts of claims about an economy when their own leader, as Treasurer, left office with an inflation rate of over 11 per cent, an unemployment rate at over 10 per cent and an utter incapacity to produce growth in any year averaging more than around two per cent. That is the condition of the economy at the moment by contrast to what it was over a decade ago when you last had an opportunity to do something about it. Do not let us hear any more nonsense of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the necessity to adopt a more stringent approach to the fiscal deficit than we thought was going to be necessary at the time of the budget last year is essentially that stress is being placed by the blow-out in the current account deficit, creating a necessity for a bigger effort on savings in both the public sector, through the budget fiscal strategy, and of course the private sector. What is in our control is essentially the public side of it. That is why we will be trying to do more and why we will do more. We will bring the budget back into surplus two years earlier than was originally indicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the current account deficit, which has stimulated that change of policy, blown out to the extent that it has done?

What were you saying about 14 per cent when those figures were announced in the last budget? You were saying that that 14 per cent figure was a fiction. You were saying it was a furphy. You were saying it was an outrage. Well, it has come in at 24 per cent and when you have an investment running at 24 per cent of course you suck in producer goods, of course you suck in capital goods, and that is what has been happening. Then you have had a worldwide two per cent increase in interest rates&mdash;worldwide, quite apart from any factors operating within the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you add all those factors up together, you have an impact on the current account of nearly $5 billion&mdash;around $4 1/2 billion out of the $8 billion that was indicated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate. In light of today's publication of the December balance of payments figures and the revised official economic forecasts released by the Treasurer yesterday, can the minister inform the Senate of the government's response to the current economic statistics?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Looking at the current economic statistics, of course we are expecting a higher level of economic growth than forecast; we are expecting a higher level of job increases than forecast. The outstanding economic performer has been business investment. In the budget we estimated that business investment would rise by 14 1/2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Evans has said in answer to the earlier question, at the time we forecast that increase in business investment the opposition and some pundits rubbished the forecast as being unrealistic and deceitful. Of course, as it has turned out, it is wrong&mdash;but not in a deceitful way, in a very positive way. We were conservative and cautious in our estimate of 14 1/2 per cent. The revised estimate figure is 24 per cent growth in business investment and, importantly, for investment in capital equipment and plant and equipment, the figure is expected to be greater than 24 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this performance, of course, is that inflation has remained low. The underlying inflation forecast rate is for 2 1/4 per cent; the headline rate, of course, is a little higher than that. But I repeat: the underlying inflation rate is 2 1/4 per cent. I remind the Senate that, when the now Leader of the Opposition, the most recent Leader of the Opposition, was Treasurer, he presided over an inflation rate that never fell below eight per cent and, when he left office, was at the level of 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Company profits have also been a strong and bullish figure in the market. On trend terms, company profits have increased over the last 13 quarters of our government. Importantly as well, competitiveness of the economy has gone sharply upwards. We are almost now 20 per cent more competitive as an economy in the world than we were three years ago. Over the last 10 years&mdash;the 10 years of our government&mdash;the Australian economy has in world terms become 30 per cent more competitive than it was before. Productivity has increased strongly; that has been a feature of the economic performance over recent years. Over the last four years national productivity has averaged an annual growth rate of two per cent a year, which is a tribute to the management of the economy by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of these changes&mdash;increased productivity, increased competitiveness in the economy&mdash;mean, as I said yesterday in answer to a question, that manufactured exports have been a strong performer for the Australian economy. We are seeing a diversification of our export base with manufactured goods and services taking a much bigger role, so that we are not now almost exclusively an exporter of under-value-added mineral products and raw materials or bulk materials from the agricultural side. We are an exporter of manufactured goods significantly too and of sophisticated services as well. Since 1985-86 manufactured goods have increased in exports more than three times&mdash;they have trebled&mdash;and the most elaborately transformed, the most complex and sophisticated manufactured goods have gone up by more than 400 per cent in that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment has added $2 billion to the current account deficit, but that has been in building up strong stock for sustainable growth. Those in the Australian business community are, in fact, investing in extending their own capacity, ensuring that Australia can take a bigger share of world manufacturing, ensuring that the capacity of the economy is extended, taking the heat off inflation&mdash;and that means employment, as Senator Evans has said, which is now forecast to grow by 3 3/4 per cent, with unemployment to go down to 8.5 per cent, which is a much stronger performance in the economy for those who are concerned with employment opportunity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is the minister aware that the December current account deficit of $2.4 billion is the highest monthly figure in Australia's history and higher than the run of deficits which prompted Mr Keating in 1986 to warn that Australia was on its way to becoming a banana republic? Is the minister aware that this figure puts Australia squarely in the league of those banana republic Latin American economies which are now in the middle of a financial crisis brought on by their chronic foreign debt? Is he aware that Australia has a current account deficit barely one per cent of GDP below Mexico's and a foreign debt level almost double that of Mexico's? What explanation does the government propose to give to the Australian people for its failed policies, which have led directly to this disastrous situation? And why, in the light of this developing crisis, is the government failing to act immediately?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The preliminary balance of  payments estimates for December show a currently estimated seasonally adjusted current account deficit of $2.4 billion. That particular sum, though large, is within the range of market expectations, not outside it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain the components so you see how it has come together. The increase was due to a rise in the merchandise trade deficit, with imports increasing by six per cent while exports fell by five per cent. The fall in exports was mainly due to a decline in rural exports. The impact of the drought has obviously been making itself manifest. It was inevitable that that would happen. It was inevitable that it would start showing up in the figures about now, and that has been fully factored into our expectations for the remainder of this year&mdash;and indeed into market expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imports of capital goods rose by 28 per cent, heavily influenced by one purchase&mdash;as they often are in particular months. In this instance, it was an LNG tanker valued at $362 million. Those imports, of course, have their own significance in adding to the productive capacity of the economy. They will play an important role in boosting future exports. They are not to be sneezed at as in some way being something bad for the economy. Imports of consumption goods reflect the overall health of the economy&mdash;the number of people getting back to work and the continued relaxation of inflation. Imports of consumption goods rose by two per cent. Imports of intermediate goods fell by two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The slow growth in exports reflects partially not only the drought problem but also lower prices for non-rural commodity exports&mdash;iron ore and coal. The growing strength that we are seeing all around the world economy at the moment should, on everybody's estimates, see a gradual improvement in the outlook for those sorts of exports, with good prospects both for higher volumes and for higher prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response by the government to this is as I described it in my last answer. When you put these figures together, you are looking at an uncomfortably high percentage of GDP&mdash;we are fully conscious of that&mdash;and it is necessary to respond accordingly with a greater effort of the public savings kind. But do not get carried away by these comparisons between the situation now and the situation in the mid-1980s, when again we approached similarly high levels of current account deficit as a percentage of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take the basic figures, you will see the points of difference. In 1985-86 growth was running at 2.2 per cent; now it is 6.4 per cent. Inflation was then 8.4 per cent; the forecast inflation at the moment is a maximum of 3 1/2 per cent for this year. Of course, the underlying rate at the moment is only around two per cent. Mortgage interest rates then were up around 15 1/2 per cent; now they are 10 1/2 per cent. Of course, as has been said over and over again, you had an infinitely less competitive environment.</PARA>

The recent extension of the United States dairy export subsidy program to Australia's markets in Asia is clearly a matter of concern to Australia's dairy farmers and puts at risk millions of dollars of export income.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Burns has been the chair of the rural committee of the Senate for some time, it is a matter that I know he has had a continuing interest in. That is why I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to what I think most people in the Senate would agree is an important issue and one which many senators, certainly those on this side, would like to hear the answer to. It is an issue that is important not just for dairy farmers but for Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Australian government and the Australian dairy industry have made it clear that we are deeply disappointed by the United States decision to introduce export subsidies into the Asian dairy market and specifically into markets which the Australian industry has assiduously worked to develop. I specifically sought a meeting with the US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, to discuss this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found both the tone and the substance of the meeting with Mr Talbott constructive and encouraging. He said that he wanted to provide Australia with what he termed a reassuring context in which future decisions on the implementation of the dairy export subsidy program were made. I will come back to some of the specifics in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Mr Talbott has come to Australia to discuss  important regional security matters, I made the point at the very outset that we considered the US dairy export subsidies a very big issue in the bilateral relationship&mdash;and I believe Australians do&mdash;and that if the US were to take the even more serious step of subsidised wheat sales to, for example, Indonesia, the issue would be much bigger again. In response, Mr Talbott stressed that he fully recognised the seriousness with which Australia viewed the recent decision and he said that he saw this issue as a major one. I sought to register, and I believe I did register firmly, the extent of potential damage to Australian dairy farmers and the fact that the US actions are not even in the interests of US taxpayers or the efficient US dairy farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence I was able to provide to Mr Talbott, with the assistance of the Dairy Industry Council and a chart provided by the Dairy Industry Council which I will table in the Senate, shows that not only is the United States subsidising but also the subsidy levels are substantially in excess of what is necessary to make sales. With the nature of the dairy market and the growing demand for dairy products in Asia, it is economic nonsense for the United States to be acting in the way it is. It is also trade irresponsibility. This chart graphically illustrates this point. If the United States government has got money to throw away, it will be much better used addressing the very serious issues raised by the President in his state of the union address to Congress, meeting the needs of Americans in need instead of attacking the incomes of Australian dairy farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Talbott, in response, made three key points. He undertook to convey back to Washington every nuance of what the Australian government had said to him on this matter. He said that President Clinton had given the Prime Minister, as we know, assurances on the implementation of the US export subsidy scheme and that the President would stick to those assurances. He gave me the assurance that whatever the US might do subsequently in regard to the export subsidy, it would act in a manner which was consistent with the spirit and the substance of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned and will continue with the cooperation of the Dairy Industry Council and the dairy industry to provide the United States administration with accurate market intelligence as a basis for the US to set more commercially sensible export subsidy levels. If it must subsidise&mdash;of course, we wish it would not&mdash;we can try to contribute to minimise the impact on Australian exporters and also US taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sought during the meeting to drive home and reinforce our concerns so that they are heard in Washington. The Dairy Industry Council, through Mr Rowley and others, is there in Washington with the ambassador making that point now. We are very concerned about the impact of this on Australian dairy farmers, on Australian exports and on the Australian economy. We would be very concerned about the impact on the relationship between similar programs on grains and developments arising in the farm bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But, so far as investment is concerned, which is the other major component of it, that is very much a product of success. When you have a booming economy, when you have hauled yourself out of recession and when you move down the path of investment running at 24 per cent rather than the 14 per cent that nobody believed was possible just a few months ago, obviously that has implications. Obviously, the other major component of it, the rise in world interest rates, which impact on what we have to pay overseas in servicing our debt, is beyond our control as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the overall situation does have to be addressed. You cannot be running figures at that level. You have to increase the saving stock, both public and private, in order to be able to pay for deficits of that kind. Thus it is that the Treasurer emphasised yesterday the need to go back to the fiscal strategy and to accelerate the pace at which we get the budget back into surplus. We will be bringing it back into surplus in 1996-97 in the budget that we produce in May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The components of that particular budget will be undoubtedly all three&mdash;the outlays side, the revenue side and the assets side. It will be a matter of careful balance and decision to see how that particular balance sorts itself out. The primary emphasis will undoubtedly be on the outlays side. We will not even get to a consideration of revenues measures until we see what more it is absolutely possible to do on the outlays side, as we have done rigorously and relentlessly over the years, but we will be doing it again because we understand our obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think it is desirable that more of the burden of redressing this situation and contributing to savings be through fiscal policy&mdash;the budget and those three components of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Foreman for his question. There was a lot of publicity in January about Australia's involvement in the EXPRESS program, which stands for the experimental re-entry space system. It was a joint German-Japanese funded program valued at about $100 million that involved a rocket and satellite being launched from the Kagashima space port in Japan on Monday, 16 January to be recovered at Woomera on Saturday, 21 January. The recovered satellite was to be examined for a number of scientific and industry related experiments. Unfortunately, as the publicity has shown, the capsule did not achieve a correct orbit after launch. It is believed to have burned up and made an uncontrolled re-entry into the Pacific Ocean with no danger to human life.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Kemp, and I am surprised that Senator Hill, a South Australian, would be dismissive of South Australia's involvement in this program. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that the German commitment will continue. In the meantime we will have another program, a specific Japanese program, called ALFLEX, which is an automatic landing flight experiment, as part of the long-term space program. We are negotiating with the Japanese that Woomera can be used for the testing of the vehicle. This would be a one-third scale model of a proposed space vehicle as part of the long-term HOPE program. The negotiations have not been completed but already the Japanese have indicated that of all the sites they have seen around the world they believe Woomera is the best place to test at an experimental level this space vehicle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they do get agreement from the Japanese government in the years ahead to spend $A2 billion to have a full-scale program, we believe Woomera would still be the preferred site to recover that experimental vehicle on probably up to 10 occasions a year which would mean, again, involvement of Australian people, Australian jobs and Australian expertise. This is one way Australia can very usefully re-enter a space program. As Senator Kemp might not know, a Senate committee took a bipartisan view some years ago to encourage Australia to be re-involved in space programs as it was in the 1960s. That was supported by Liberal senators as well as Labor senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Evans, representing the Prime Minister. Is the minister aware of the comments of Mr Adrian de Bruin, the Managing Director of SEAS Sapfor&mdash;one of Australia's leading timber companies&mdash;that sawn wood products from plantations could very feasibly replace wood products from Australia's native forests within the next two to five years? Do you agree with the comments from this leader of the timber industry that `time is running out for our native forests, wilderness areas and endangered species'? Is it the government's view that the future of the timber industry lies entirely with plantation forestry? Isn't it time the federal government put in place a timber industry plan which maps out a transition to a plantation based sustainable timber industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="265" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's attitude towards the future of the timber industry was well and truly mapped out and stated in the context of the national forest policy statement in 1992. The future of this industry is manifestly not one that the Commonwealth government can determine alone. It is quintessentially a matter for the states in relation to which the Commonwealth only has extremely limited powers. Nonetheless, within the context of those powers, we have done our best to try, with the states, to negotiate an approach to the industry which gets a necessary balance of all the competing values that are involved in this particular area, and that is exactly what the national forest policy statement of 1992 does. Regrettably, it is still lacking the signature of Tasmania but it has got everyone else's. It is to be hoped within that framework that we can get a result that you and those on the other side of this equation can regard as sensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind you of the elements of that statement so far as the national goals and objectives are concerned. They are very largely, if not wholly, consistent with the philosophy that you have espoused in that question. So far as conservation is concerned, the goals are to maintain an extensive and permanent native forest estate in Australia and to manage that estate in an ecologically sustainable manner so as to conserve the full suite of relevant values the forest can provide for current and future generations. No statement could be clearer than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to wood production and industry development, the goal is for Australia to develop internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable wood production and wood product industries. So far as decision making is concerned, the goal is to reduce fragmentation and duplication in land use decision making processes between the states and the Commonwealth. We all know that that is one of the biggest problems of all in trying to get rational decision making in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives also go to private native forests because they can be as significant in the long term as the forests in the public domain and it is crucial to ensure that they too are managed in an ecologically sustainable manner. The goal so far as plantations is concerned, on which you place particular emphasis in your question, is to expand the commercial plantations of both softwoods and hardwoods so as to provide an additional economically viable, reliable, high quality wood resource for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone believes that it is possible to wholly phase out the logging and so on of native forests. What is certainly possible is to deal with it in a way that produces not only ecological sustainability but also an extensive and permanent national native forest estate which does conserve the full suite of values that forests can provide&mdash;including biological diversity, heritage and Aboriginal and other cultural values, as well as purely environmental ones. So they are our objectives. That is what we believe is achievable and that is what we will be continuing to work away at achieving with the states, given the very limited range of policy weapons that we have at our disposal. That is almost certainly the best we can do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The human rights subcommittee of this parliament and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its report last year requested the government to make bilateral and multilateral representations to urge the cessation of coercive population programs. Because China's brutal one child per family policy involves forced abortions and coerced sterilisations, including castrations, what action has the government taken in respect of our report? Has the human rights section of your department considered the human rights implications of your government's bill introduced yesterday which would have the effect of forcibly returning to China a woman asylum seeker, pregnant with her second child, to the torture of forced abortion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reference to torture of forced abortion is a pretty large assumption in that particular context and I do not think there is any reason whatever for Senator Harradine to assume that that would be the outcome in that particular case. There is an obvious problem, as has been identified by Senator Bolkus, with the court ruling which makes potentially almost the entire population of 1.2 billion people in China refugees simply by virtue of the population policies and the one child limitation that applies in that country. Manifestly, that is simply an unsustainable basis on which to conduct any kind of rational refugee humanitarian policy. That has been the view taken by the UN High Commission on Refugees and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we have anything to defend in that respect. We are concerned and have been concerned all along&mdash;as Senator Harradine well knows from the extensive debate on these matters in estimates committees and elsewhere&mdash;about those elements of the Chinese population program which are coercive in character. A number of representations have been made on that subject and will continue to be made, not least in the context of the human rights delegations that we have managed to send to China on two occasions and which we are now trying to negotiate for a further instalment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot answer off the top of my head what has been done in the last few months specifically on that topic. I will seek such further information as I can and let Senator Harradine know. But Senator Harradine knows that I fully share his distaste at anything that is coercive in this particular area. He knows how hard we have been working with the UNFPA and others to try to get accepted in China standards and practices which are consistent with basic human rights rules and principles in this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would that we were able to do more in that respect, but we are certainly trying and we do so, to the extent that we participate in family planning programs in China&mdash;fund them and so on, or fund international agencies&mdash;from the perspective that we genuinely believe it is much more influential to be working from inside the system, by example in this way, rather than simply standing back and addressing objections to it from the outside.</PARA>

I repeat my question: has the human rights section of his department considered the human rights implications of this bill? If it has done so, will the minister table that particular report? Secondly, in some parts of China, as the minister would know, for every 100 boys born there are only 79 girls born. Much of this is a result of ultrasound technology.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As many people in this place would know, there has been since this government came to office a very significant growth in the number of child-care places&mdash;from about 43,000 or 46,000 when we came into office to around a quarter of a million now. Last year we commissioned a number of reports to examine child care to make sure we were fully aware of and up to date with the state of play in the child-care area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern that emerged was not about the number of places, although there is still an ongoing concern about that, but about how child care was actually meeting the needs of parents. The first thing parents asked for was places. Those places have been delivered and will continue to be delivered. Parents were also concerned about quality, and we are delivering on that, but particularly things like flexibility, hours that centres are open, penalty fees and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end, and because I am very concerned that child care does meet the needs of parents, I have established a national advisory council on child care which is made up of parents and parent users of child care. The 12 member council includes people who either have used or are currently using a whole variety of child-care facilities that we provide. Those members have a wide experience and expertise across child care and represent the whole range of the child-care industry.</PARA>

I have asked it to look at three issues in particular: flexibility of services, a complaints mechanism, and parental involvement in the delivery of child care. There is a very big disparity between parent participation, and I think it is very important that we hear from the parents how and to what extent they might want to be involved in the child-care centres and the care that is being provided for their children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be obvious to everyone how question time works, so let me at least put it on the record, especially for those in the gallery who are interested. Generally, the President is given a list from both sides of the priority order of questions. The proposition that Senator Hill is putting forward today is that opposition senators think the latter two questions were the most critical, and they want to continue with them. If this was the most critical issue, why didn't they ask about it in the first two questions?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that it is opposition senators who determine the priority of their questions. When it came to the two questions on the issue that they now want to pursue, they asked stupid and irrelevant questions&mdash;not relevant or robust questions, but shallow and irrelevant questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Hill has done today to prop up his doubtful leadership of Australia's answer to the barmy army opposite is to say, `We will have another three or four questions.' People may not realise that for the next half hour under the standing orders we can have the noting of questions, which means that those two questions on the logging issue and the environment can be debated then. Not only that, but we can then have an urgency motion on the same subject. Potentially, we can quite properly spend between 2 o'clock and 5 o'clock on these issues. All that Senator Hill has done is put in another half hour of misguided slanging matches that get this country absolutely nowhere. Senator Hill, you had your chance today to show some leadership, and one of your frontbench disgraced himself. He disgraced and ashamed your new leader and you failed to do anything about it. </PARA>

Why was $120,000 given to the green movement to assess the right of workers to work? Why was that money spent?

As has been demonstrated by the people in the gallery and on both sides of the house, this is a very emotional issue, and so it should be. But the difficulty is that it has become so emotional that the questions are emotionally asked and the answers are emotionally given. I do not mind the questions being emotional, but unfortunately they breach all the tests set out in chapter 11.

But the conduct of this chamber&mdash;I am not suggesting either side&mdash;at question time and before has not been as edifying as it sometimes is. If we continue to ask these questions while we are all emotionally charged, this situation is going to continue. This was Senator Ray's point, as I understand it. I am not saying that there should not be emotion in debates in this chamber. I am not saying that people in the gallery should not become emotional if they so desire, but can't they do that just as well in the procedures that are already open to us?

You say when we want answers from the minister responsible, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), that we have had enough time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions have to be asked by people on this side of the chamber because nobody on that side of the chamber is prepared to ask the questions that they know need to be asked. Senator Devereux has already ratted on the Labor people who put him into the parliament. Senator Coates and Senator Sherry have absented themselves from the chamber during this time of great importance for their Tasmanian constituents. I give Senator Denman and Senator Murphy the acknowledgment that they are at least in the chamber. But, with his background as a union representative in the Australian Timber Workers Union, which carries a long tradition, does Senator Murphy realise that his name is now `Weasel' with the timber workers? He is regarded as having dumped them and tried to produce inefficient and unacceptable compromises that will do nothing for the industry which he knows. </PARA>

But, as they will not, we must. We are entitled to answers in this place. After all, the forum of the parliament centres on the accountability of the government to the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to forest management.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday afternoon, following intense questioning from my colleagues of the Liberal-National coalition, it became very evident from the lips of the environmental minister that the report that he issued to his colleague Minister Beddall is very one-sided. In fact, it lacks balance. The consequence of that report is devastating so far as the timber industry is concerned because it has placed at risk the livelihood and jobs of thousands of people around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of taking note of this answer is to point out that, on the one hand, the industry, the foresters and the states have to make a carefully prepared scientific evaluation and yet, on the other hand, the environment minister accepts quite a flippant, quick and inadequate response conducted by people who do not necessarily have the adequate qualifications. What was the sort of answer to Senator Alston's question? The Senate got a non-answer. Because of the minister's refusal to answer, senators were put in a situation of having to demand extra time because we want answers. In the circumstances, it is a democratic right for the Senate to receive a response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the minister might not have had an answer in relation to a particular coupe&mdash;or who Natalie was&mdash;I would have thought that he could have produced from his desk or from his files a representative case. He could have said, `I mightn't have this one, but I've got 20 or 30 others as a representative sample.' The minister's failure to produce to the Senate the sorts of assessments that were made by this ad hoc group of people with government sponsorship, with government aid, with government assistance, leaves a lot to be desired. Where is the accountability? On the one hand, as I say, state governments, forestry companies and others have to put a lot of money aside to prepare a scientific basis for these types of evaluations. But, on the other hand, we see jobs sacrificed on the altar of political expediency to try to get a few votes from the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe state governments have evaluated forest resources responsibly and set in place agreements that not only ensure the protection of the heritage value of forests but also provide a basis of certainty&mdash;certainty on which the forest industry can proceed. Unfortunately, that evaluation process has been placed in jeopardy. Where is the credibility of this whole process when a few people with prejudiced ideas can come in and so influence a minister that he prepares such a one-sided report to throw all these good people in the gallery, their friends and their relations right across Australia onto the scrap heap of despair?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other night a Commonwealth driver asked one of those people how long they were staying. He said, `There's no point in going home. We've got no jobs to go back to.' They have no jobs to go back to because of the decisions, the ad hoc decisions, of this government, which is playing into the hands of a few extreme people&mdash;I emphasise `extreme people'&mdash;on the far left of the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened? The very security of the management is wrecked by this federal government's unwillingness to put in place long-term export licence agreements because we have this stupid concept of annual renewals. Apart from that, we have chaos because of the ineptitude not only of Minister Faulkner in accepting and providing a shonky report to Minister Beddall, but also, of course, in Beddall's lacking sense in not following the procedures laid down by cabinet and the law. Far worse, there is a wider dimension to this chaos as a result of this whole debacle. The whole of our export industry, not only woodchipping, according to the Attorney-General, can be thrown into chaos. I am talking about alumina; I am talking about coal; I am talking about aluminium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You people up there are representing just one segment of a wider section of the Australian industry and exporters who provide income and a remedy to our balance of payments problems. You people are providing export income. What is further surprising is that the industries that are most subject to attack are the very industries that the green movement and Minister Faulkner and his cohorts believe should be protected&mdash;the saw log industry, the veneer industry and other downstream industries. The government has got it completely wrong, and has thrown the credibility of whole evaluation process into complete chaos. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The one thing that the people of Australia need to understand is that the people sitting in the gallery are the true conservationists of this  country. They are the people that care about the forests because their livelihoods depend on them, and for them to destroy their forests would be to destroy their livelihoods. They are the people who are genuinely concerned, not the Australian Democrats and the Greens. The Democrats came into this parliament on the motto of keeping the bastards honest, but they are too scared to allow the opposition to ask questions of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. What about keeping them honest? They are scared because, if we ask the questions we have been asking for the last two days, it will be exposed that the organisations that support the Australian Democrats and the Greens are the ones that have been funded by Senator Faulkner and his Labor Party to give them reports and to give them the outcomes that will destroy the jobs of these people and the people in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us never forget that this minister said publicly that there had been a `rigorous'&mdash;his word&mdash;examination of 1,300 coupes, and he recommended 1,300 coupes. Let us look at the facts. The amount spent on that study was $120,000. That money was given to the green movement, it was their study, and it was done within seven weeks. If you analyse the statistics that means they analysed each coupe for one hour, and that is on the basis they worked 24 hours per day, seven days a week. They spent $100 examining each coupe of the 1,300 that were recommended. Of course, that raises the question: what about all the other coupes they allegedly looked at and considered which were not recommended?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is&mdash;and I would lay my bottom dollar on this&mdash;that these people who made these sorts of recommendations to the government did not even go out to have a look at the coupes. They sat in their plush offices&mdash;undoubtedly taxpayer funded&mdash;to write these reports to try to assist the green cause. But how rigorous was the examination when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) struck out 791 of those 1,300 coupes and said, `We will now make it 509 coupes'? How serious are they? How genuine are they? They are not genuine at all because the study that was funded by the Labor Party into the green movement to give the desired result was not rigorous. If it was rigorous, all 1,300 coupes must have stood up to the prime ministerial test. The simple fact is that the minister for the environment has been rebuffed, even by his Prime Minister, and had the recommended numbers more than halved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a chronic shame that there is not a single member of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber or around this parliament who is prepared to wear the forest workers' badge&mdash;the one that I am wearing very proudly today. Why is it that a former official of the Timber Workers Union in my home state of Tasmania does not wear a badge which simply says `Forest workers care for forests'? He is not even prepared to identify in that small way with the cause that he used to earn his income from. He is now in Canberra. He is now in the Labor caucus; he can forget about the workers. That is what happens to the Australian Labor Party representatives when they come up here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We and the Australian people need to realise one very simple thing in this debate: the Greens and the Democrats, who have now hijacked the Australian Labor Party, will continually say that the environment and nature need protection. So when a little beaver cuts down saplings and dams rivers, that is part of nature, that is okay; but when humans cut down trees and dam rivers, that is not part of nature, even when we replace the trees. The simple fact they have to realise is that we human beings are part of nature and part of this planet. The Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens would do very well to get themselves back onto this planet, back into the real world and look out for the people that I am so very proud to represent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to take note of the two answers by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), particularly the one to Senator Alston. It is a pity that we did not have more time to ask questions in question time today because I particularly wanted to ask the minister why the government has made such a bungle of this so-called hit list in Tasmania. We all know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did this just to appease the Greens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania's case, I would have asked why it is that, of those 72-odd compartments that form part of the 509 nationwide compartments that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has compromised on to try to end this row, two of the so-called coupes under the protection hit list have been clear-felled and another 50 on the same list have either been logged previously or are being logged now. It seemed quite strange to me that two-thirds of those compartments or coupes listed in Tasmania could not even make the National Estate list. What criteria is this minister using to lock up these areas and to put the jobs in the forest industry in Tasmania in jeopardy, because these coupes do not even meet the criteria of the National Estate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Senate colleagues from Tasmania&mdash;Senator Watson, Senator Abetz, Senator Newman and Senator Gibson, who was involved very closely in the timber industry as a former manager of ANM&mdash;have seen this happen in our state. All we have seen in our state are these so-called compromises. Every time there is a compromise, more forests are lost and more forestry workers lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not hear one word from Senator Shayne Murphy. The only time you get up is when there is a dispute at the mill. That is the only reason you are here&mdash;that is what put you into parliament. Why don't you get up and tell the forestry workers of Australia what you have done to help them and what you have said in the party room? Where are the other senators and members from Tasmania? Half of them did not even show up for question time today. Where are Dick Adams and Silvia Smith? They marched with us the other day in Launceston, but what are they going to do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We haven't heard anything from them. Enough is enough. The workers of Australia are fed up with this continual gradualism, with the taking away of their jobs. Senator Abetz made a very good point: in the short time available, how were these assessments made? We were told how some of them were made: people drove around in cars. They would not even get out of the car and walk through the trees to find that on the other side of the trees there were button grass plains and that type of thing in Tasmania. Some of the areas that were recommended in the original list were nothing but button grass plains. There was not even a tree on them. A lot of them had been logged three of four times.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike former speakers, I am a senator from Western Australia. Western Australia has a great forest industry, one which brings in millions of export dollars to that state and to this country. The experience I draw on in relation to this matter is gained from conversations I have had over the last couple of days with the people surrounding this building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other night I was walking home and I walked past a group of loggers and drivers. They said, `Mate, what sort of rig are you on?' and I joked, `I'm on Comcar.' That is a very easy joke for me to make, but it is a very serious matter. Here in Canberra we are not seeing what is happening at the coalface. This demonstration has brought the coalface to Canberra. I say to those people here today that their efforts are not going unnoticed and we are not treating their efforts lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made an estimation the other day that there must have been around 250 rigs out there and I reckon they are worth about $200,000 each. That is a conservative value. I was overawed by the amount of finance it would take to keep those rigs going and by the amount of money that would need to be earned to keep the income earning unit, that rig, going. That unit supports families&mdash;men, women and children. I say to the government that the livelihood of families is an essential fact to remember in this equation. We have here people who have come a long way to tell the government that they will be in desperate straits if these measures are continued with. They are not here for fun and games; they are not here for jokes. They are very serious and they are exercising a democratic right to be here and to get their point across. I say to the government that it will be at its own peril if it ignores the voice of average working Australians such as those who surround the building today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in other parts of the world where people have finally had enough and they rise up together and make their views felt. It really does take, I believe, quite a lot to get the Australian public going. What impresses me with this demonstration is the fact that it must have been really something to have caused these people to down tools, stop work and drive thousands of kilometres to bring their problems to the capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we in this place often forget the struggles that are going on out there in the wider community with working men and women and the trouble they are having to meet their mortgage payments with rising interest rates, and to finance such things as fishing boats, trucks or whatever. The government has to take note that there is a wide section of the Australian community which has been placed in a desperate situation as a result of this. That is the feeling I have gained from speaking to people as I have walked to and from Parliament House over the last couple of days. I think it has been a worthwhile exercise. I say to those people that I think they are getting their message across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition can do only so much. We do not have the numbers and we can only keep on debating this point. I urge the government to not turn a deaf ear. I say to those in the government who were formerly involved in the trade union movement to listen to the calls of their fellow brothers in the union movement and not turn a deaf ear on them, as it seems is being done, but listen to their concerns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it particularly offensive when three years ago Senator Abetz, the then president of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, lined up with the bosses, aided and abetted by the ideologues in the Liberal Party, to crush the union movement and the workers at the Burnie paper mill in the most awful dispute, cheering all the way. It is rank hypocrisy for Senator Abetz now to come in here and claim he defends the workers and wears the badge, when three years ago he was in there, as a member of the HR Nicholls Society and supported by all the ideologues on the far right, trying to crush the union and crush the workers' rights at Burnie. </PARA>

<PARA>Question time today and the contribution by the minister Senator Schacht just now give clear evidence, if clear evidence is needed, of just what a bunch of incompetent fools run this country at the present time&mdash;a bunch of incompetent fools. The way this forest policy issue has been handled just demonstrates that yet again.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 800,000 workers cannot get a job because of the incompetence and bungling of the people who occupy the front benches here. We have a foreign debt that is approaching $200 billion; a current account deficit that is running wild; and now a forest policy, or lack of a policy, lack of implementation of a policy, that will cause untold damage to small business and workers and unionists around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we get from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, is more and more equivocation. Senator Faulkner, fresh from his humiliation over Oyster Point&mdash;where, by his own panel of experts, he was proved to be completely wrong; where, by his action, he cost the jobs of 200 or 300 other workers around Australia&mdash;appears here today with this ridiculous stupidity of the handling of the forest policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A news article earlier this week had a headline titling the Labor Party's handling of this issue as `pulp fiction'. But I think it would be more apt to title Senator Faulkner, the minister responsible, as a `Forrest Gump'. The only difference between Senator Faulkner and Forrest Gump is that Forrest Gump is willing to admit he is an idiot. The way this government has handled this issue is just nothing short of a disgrace. Senator Faulkner relies upon advice from consultants&mdash;advice which will indirectly affect the jobs of 75,000 Australians and which will directly affect Australia's annually received income of $420 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want Senator Faulkner to go on with the rubbish that he went on with in question time yesterday because the Resource Assessment Commission has said, in an exhaustive study, that no evidence exists that any plant or animal species has been threatened with extinction because of forest industries. Many of the forests in the coupes that Senator Faulkner has mentioned have been logged for over 100 years, yet they still show high conservation values, according to Senator Faulkner&mdash;and that clearly demonstrates the resilience of our forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Gibson pointed out earlier, what sort of a fool running this government would claim in a letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the Hensleigh Creek catchment has a number of values which add to its conservation significance, including the presence of a nationally rare plant, Eucalyptus denticulata and the presence of rainforest.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Faulkner said in his letter&mdash;`including the presence of a nationally rare plant.' As Senator Gibson pointed out in his question, this nationally rare plant to which Senator Faulkner&mdash;or Forrest Gump&mdash;referred was formerly known by another name. In fact, it is colloquially known as `shining gum'. It is a major timber species in the area. There are thousands of hectares of forest containing this species in a park adjoining this coupe and in other areas in East Gippsland. The species is also present in the central highlands and in many areas of state forests in Victoria, which are harvested and regenerated with seed of the same species from the same locality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are literally hundreds and thousands of acres of this plant which Senator Faulkner refers to as `a nationally rare plant'. Perhaps Senator Faulkner, who is going to follow me in this debate, could explain why the shining gum&mdash;which covers thousands of hectares&mdash;is a nationally rare plant. I want to again ask Senator Faulkner to help me by identifying why he has taken advice from the Conservation Council in Western Australia, when he has completely ignored the Conservation and Land Management Department and the Australian Heritage Commission, which have done a lot of work in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues which I am not going to have time to raise completely, but which I want to put to Senator Faulkner. Can he tell the Senate why a logging compartment in the McPherson State Forest in central New South Wales was chosen when it has a plantation of young gum trees dotted all over a sandy scar of a neglected airstrip that closed a decade ago? What is the high conservation value about that one? Can he also refer to the Wild Cattle Creek State Forest in New South Wales, which he said has high conservation values? I ask Senator Faulkner to confirm that this is partly cleared ex-dairy farms which now have regrowth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole basis of Senator Ian Macdonald's urgency motion is nonsense. The Commonwealth is absolutely committed to the implementation of the national forest policy statement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to understand that the NFPS is a state and Commonwealth agreement. That means that it requires not just a commitment from the Commonwealth but state cooperation in order to be effectively implemented. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recognised this in his statement of 22 December last year when he announced that he put in place some very important measures to break the impasse on the implementation of the NFPS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories&mdash;and as I have said time and time again in this chamber&mdash;the conservation elements of the national forest policy statement are obviously my central responsibility. A central conservation objective of the NFPS is the commitment to the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for our forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NFPS also sets out a process to comprehensively assess the full range of environmental and heritage obligations. These include assessment of national estate values, World Heritage values, environmental impacts, Aboriginal heritage values and obligations relating to international conventions, including those to protect endangered species and biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the NFPS also contains an agreement that, until the assessments of the full range of environment and heritage values are completed and the reserve system is  established, activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value should be avoided. That is, of course, commonly known as the moratorium clause of the NFPS. The NFPS also makes it clear that the Commonwealth has certain responsibilities with regard to the protection of forests. These include World Heritage, biodiversity, endangered species, Aboriginal heritage and national estate values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1993, the cabinet decided that, in future, the minister for the environment would be required to provide the minister responsible for resources with advice on the applicability of the national forest policy statement to the granting of export woodchip licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me speak now on the processes that were followed in developing my advice for Minister Beddall last year. In July 1994, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy wrote to state forest agencies seeking a complete list of places to be logged and from which woodchips would be obtained. DPIE also sought information from state agencies on what they were doing to implement the moratorium clause of the NFPS. The information to be provided was specified in a grants agreement between DEST and the conservation organisations because, in August 1994, my department funded conservation organisations to allow them to participate in the process. I spoke in question time about these grants agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation organisations were required to provide substantiated evidence against specified criteria. The criteria relate directly to the Commonwealth government's obligations and interests under international conventions, Commonwealth legislation or the requirements of the national forest policy statement. That includes old-growth forest and wilderness, national estate, World Heritage, endangered species and biodiversity values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in August, the acting environment minister, Senator Bolkus, wrote to state ministers and to industry informing them of this initiative and inviting them to comment and advise the department on the advice received from conservation organisations. Similar letters were sent from myself to relevant trade unions and the Forest Protection Society. Contact was made at officials level also between governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales and Tasmanian governments responded that they would not cooperate in the assessment process. One of the biggest problems with this exercise was that, by mid-September, little advice on the proposed logging plans of state agencies and the ways in which states were implementing the moratorium clause had been received by my portfolio to enable the portfolio and conservation groups to determine priority areas for assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states' advice was received from DPIE by the forest branch in the environment strategies directorate in my department. It was forwarded to the Environment Protection Agency, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the World Heritage and biodiversity branch and the environment resources information network in the environment strategies directorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These areas undertook the analysis of the state logging plans and incorporated the information the conservation groups supplied as it became available in early November. The Australian Heritage Commission concurrently undertook its section 30 analysis, as required under the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Upon receipt of the reports from the conservation groups in early November, they were forwarded to state governments, including New South Wales and Tasmania, even though they had said they were not going to cooperate, to NAFI, the Forest Protection Society and the union, the CFMEU, for comment to enable them to advise my department of any errors in the information. Only Western Australia commented on the areas the conservation groups had listed. Victoria provided a strategic approach to the protection of conservation values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The portfolio undertook its assessment of the conservation significance of the areas planned to be logged in a variety of ways, depending on the level and detail of information known about the regions. The portfolio checked the geographic location of the coupes in order to determine obvious errors. That identification process did pick up a number of errors. For example, Forestry Tasmania had, in the original plans, misspecified the location of quite a number of coupes which we found to be located in the middle of Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Heritage Commission checked coupes against information held on the register of the National Estate. ERIN mapped the location of coupes against information it holds on nationally threatened species and rare species of plants that it obtained from the records of museums, herbaria and botanical gardens around Australia. ANCA plotted the location of coupes against information it holds on the distribution of national, state and regional rare and threatened species and communities. It undertook an analysis of the significance of places for the conservation of biological diversity. This included an analysis of the significance of regions and the importance of particular locations in the protection of biodiversity at a regional level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation status of forest communities was checked by the portfolio against all the available information. Where it was considered an area was poorly reserved, it was listed as likely to be of high conservation value. An analysis was also undertaken on the habitat requirements and strategies that are needed to be put in place to protect species listed in the Endangered Species Protection Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis of coupes was undertaken by the Heritage Commission against the national wilderness inventory for those regions where it had been completed. Where the national wilderness inventory was several years old, an assessment was made, frequently in consultation with conservation groups, of the level of impact that logging operations had on that wilderness area. In places where the national wilderness inventory had not been completed&mdash;in New South Wales and the south-west of Western Australia&mdash;other assessments were used, notably the New South Wales parks and wildlife assessment of wilderness areas and the joint AHC-CALM assessment used in the southern forest region of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The portfolio also carefully assessed the values of coupes against documents and published information held in the portfolio and against previous assessments undertaken in cooperation with state agencies where Commonwealth officials had participated or where assessments were undertaken by the Commonwealth. The portfolio applied the NFPS definition of old-growth forest in undertaking its assessment and it relied on the existing mapping of old-growth forests, which was undertaken by state agencies, to support its analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEST relied on the Tasmanian forest and forest industry strategy old-growth assessment to determine the old-growth status of forests in many parts of that state. Consistent with the NFPS, the portfolio would not accept that the occurrence of some past logging for sawlogs in itself prevents an area from being an old-growth forest. That view is reinforced by the outcomes of the study by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources of old-growth forests in East Gippsland which is recognised as being the best methodology for the identification of old-growth forest yet developed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales and Tasmanian governments' rebuttal of the department's analysis of old-growth forests has generally been on the basis of the presence of old logging tracks in the vicinity indicating that the area was likely to have been logged for sawlogs without an explanation of when. It could have been up to 100 years ago when they used selective logging with bullocks and it does not take into account the current age and appearance of the forest. Where a state agency commented on the outputs of the conservation organisation, this was assessed and incorporated into the analysis. This is reflected in the assessment of areas likely to be of high conservation value in Western Australia and which incorporates that infor mation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people contributing to this debate say that the national forest policy statement is the way forward. I certainly agree with that. But the NFPS will not stand up if we ignore or do not give proper consideration to its conservation elements.

I demonstrated that incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to return to the debate on the passage of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Amendment Bill 1986. The second reading speech given by the minister at the time, Mr Cohen, is a pertinent illustration of the intent of the government at the time in establishing this process. I remind the Senate that these comments were made on 17 April 1986. We were told that the object of the act, which originally came into force in 1974 and was being amended here, was `to ensure that to the greatest extent practicable matters affecting the environment to a significant extent are fully examined and taken into account in relation to actions and decisions of the Commonwealth government and its authorities'. We were further told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act is a cornerstone of the Government's environment protection legislation. Under its provisions the environmental implications of a wide range of proposals have been examined.</PARA>
<PARA>This has only recently been brought to our attention, but it was said in 1986. The minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include airports, railways, ports, highways, buildings, and coal, iron ore, uranium and woodchip export projects.</PARA>
<PARA>We were also told that the government took into account two important procedures with this act. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is that memoranda of understanding to be agreed between the environment Department and other Commonwealth departments and authorities. These memoranda will provide a clear basis for identifying proposals that are environmentally significant. The second is that, in the rare event that there is a difference of opinion between Ministers on the environmental significance of a particular proposal, the matter would be resolved by the normal process of referral to the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will provide . . . for the preparation of public environment reports&mdash;PERs&mdash;for proposals with less complex or less important environmental implications.</PARA>
<PARA>Before he concluded, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 is a major piece of legislation which, since its introduction, has significantly assisted Ministers in taking environmental implications properly into account in Government decision making. The amendments to the Act and administrative procedures which the Government intends to make will further improve the effectiveness of the process.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill was commended to the house. Before it received passage, Senator Collard, the then Leader of the National Party of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a Bill that we will not be opposing, as it makes a fair bit of sense.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that it was the result of the benefits of several reports and that therefore it was a wonderful thing. It received support from that speaker. I remind the Senate that, at the time, the Australian Democrats said that we thought the balance was wrong, that the ministers in contention would not deliver a proper result and that the EIS should be under the control of the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Environment who would then, perhaps in consultation with the action minister, achieve a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We criticised it then. We said that the process was faulty. At the time we said that the results that would be delivered were not satisfactory. We are vindicated by this very mess that we see before us today.

We are interested in what it has actually done. We agree that that is worthy of criticism. That is why we will be supporting this motion before us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are talking about a crisis in the forest industry. Woodchipping has been a clever political diversion. The real argument is not about woodchips; the real argument is about the use of the native forests of Australia. The extreme Greens have been pushing for many years to try to lock up all the native forests of Australia. Such groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society, have compiled public written, long-term objectives about it all. There is no argument that that is what they are on about. They have been peddling apparent scientific nonsense to the community, which is gullible about these issues, and trying to assert that the forests of Australia are being desecrated. What nonsense!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been through many inquiries. In 1988, then Prime Minister Hawke said, `We've had enough of all these arguments. We should have a huge inquiry into what is going on and establish the scientific credibility of what is going on.' A Resource Assessment Commission hearing under Justice Stewart from 1989 to 1992 cost many millions of dollars. Everyone had a chance to put their views about what was going on. What arose out of that? The Resource Assessment Commission said that there was no ecological reason why, provided that there are adequate reserves throughout Australia, a large proportion of the native forests could not have multiple uses, including of wood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real argument is really about how much park is locked up and how much multiple use forest is used. Woodchipping is the diversion that is being used in this argument. So the Hawke government, arising out that RAC inquiry, ended up negotiating with the states and establishing the national forest policy statement, which was signed by most of the premiers in December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened since then? All the states complain that this government's Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, which is supposed to be establishing the criteria for the assessment of all these forests, has not provided the criteria. It will not cooperate or agree. The latest Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) is a prime example of that. By not establishing that criteria, we do not have the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states that should be in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the states have been through this process many times. My own state of Tasmania has been through very extensive examinations of the forests, but we have not reached agreement with the Commonwealth. Because the Commonwealth has not cooperated in helping to solve this problem once and for all, it is no wonder that some of the states have not wanted to cooperate with Senator Faulkner and his department as they went off on a political exercise. The federal government has been on a political exercise, using this matter to try to get encouragement and votes for itself in suburban Melbourne and Sydney, where people are ignorant about the true matters and how forests work. That is what it is really all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner has made considerable effort to stress that he is implementing the so-called moratorium clause of the national forest policy statement. This clause, which is on page 11 of the statement, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on to say that the primary means of protecting these values is through a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. It does not suggest that all old-growth forests or wilderness areas are likely to have conservation value. Quite the contrary. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will continue to use old-growth timber for many years. It will come from disturbed forests containing some old-growth trees and from old-growth forests that are not required for the nature conservation reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the definition of the reserve system that really needs to be decided. The Commonwealth is to blame for not organising it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By soliciting the advice of the environmental lobby groups in this latest round and then failing to scientifically scrutinise the advice, the minister and his department are derelict in their duty and have undermined the goodwill that is required to implement the national forest policy statement. In providing his advice to the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), Senator Faulkner paid scant regard to the evidence provided by the state management agencies that the compartments identified by the environment lobby did not have high conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list provided by Senator Faulkner included plantations established for timber production, previously cleared farm land and many forests that had been logged at least once. Surely these areas cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered old-growth forests or wilderness. In order to show how shonky the process was, I will quote from a letter from the Victorian department to the Commonwealth department of late last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria's view of the process that has been established with the conservation groups is that it has no scientific credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Victoria's case, all that the groups have done is to take our own data, adjust some threshold levels to suit themselves . . . and present it in mostly tabular form. There is no scientific analysis . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What absolute nonsense. They also claim that some wilderness areas exist in the central highlands, which the state government's agency in Victoria claims do not exist at all. In Victoria, about 60 per cent of the old growth is locked up in parks of one sort or another. Many examples have been quoted, so let me quote a couple of Tasmanian examples. The conservation group that assessed Ringarooma coupes 107A, 108A and 108B claimed they were old growth forests and part of the undisturbed upper catchment of the Forester river. It just so happens that they do not belong to the Forester river; they are part of the Ringarooma river. The forests in these coupes have been heavily cut over for sawlog and are now mainly regrowth. Part of one of these coupes is abandoned, formerly cleared farmland. The forest in each of these coupes does not meet the national forest definition of `whole growth forests'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is Koonya 1A, again in Tasmania. There is a claim from a conservation group that this is important habitat for the swift parrot, a valuable species. The actual facts are that logging in the coupe was completed last year. The coupe contains E. Regnans, E. Obliqua and E. Delegatensi forest communities. This forest is not significant for swift parrots. The swift parrots' habitat is eucalyptus globulus forest on the dry coastal zones&mdash;quite different. They have got it all wrong. They are good examples of what is actually going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So by doing this Senator Faulkner has demeaned the whole process of true environmental assessment. He must get on with the process and reach agreement with the states using proper scientific criteria and not mess around trying to play politics between Sydney and Melbourne and the forest communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we will not encourage support for the national forest policy statement. It is reprehensible that the government has signed an agreement and then not fulfilled its obligations. The national forest policy statement was roundly condemned by the conservation movement when it was first introduced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ecologically sustainable forestry, according to the national forest policy statement, involves identifying representative examples of forest and the minimum forest necessary to provide habitat for part of the population of each species of Australian fauna. This is then defined as high conservation value and, hopefully, secured in reserves. The remainder of the forest is then considered available for logging. By this system we are creating museum forests, or zoo forests, small reminders of the magnificent heritage entrusted to us by previous generations to pass on to the next generation. The community has made it clear that it does not want old growth forest destroyed for woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In identifying 509 areas but not providing for their adequate protection, the federal government has condemned some of those very areas along with the other 800 identified by the environment minister. There is nothing to protect these areas from logging for sawlogs or the devastation caused by the building of roads. It is highly likely that these areas will be targeted by state agencies so that the values are destroyed or diminished by the time the government gets around to placing them into reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to address the claims that areas without high conservation value were included in Senator Faulkner's advice to Mr Beddall. This is clearly designed to discredit the conservation movement, the eminent scientists, Senator Faulkner and the many government agencies involved in preparing the advice. Some of the forest blocs nominated in Western Australia include clear-felled areas and the WA advice made it quite clear that these areas were to be excluded. This illustrates that state forests and forestry departments have got in so quickly and it shows the fundamental problem for conservationists in that by highlighting areas for protection it makes them vulnerable to logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have real concerns for the future of our precious forest ecosystems and the forestry industry. The people employed in the industry have real concerns when they see the forest set aside for them being reduced. The only way forward for the government is to devise funds and implement a transition strategy away from the export woodchipping and the woodchipping of old growth and high conservation value forest and onto other sources of wood products. This may well cost the government in terms of subsidies and tax relief. However, the industry is already subsidised in a variety of ways. These subsidies would be far better directed towards a transition out of old growth logging. Unless we act now, our native forests outside of conservation reserves will soon be gone. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The issues that we are facing now will inevitably have to be faced one day. The government has completely failed to resolve this issue. Greens, workers and the community at large will continue to be frustrated and angry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government is the mastermind of an unparalleled environmental fraud. It has undermined not only the industry but has made a sham of the assessment process. The mess by which the Minister for the Environment, Senator Faulkner, has put at risk the lives and security of over 22,000 decent and hardworking families, mostly in rural and regional Australia, should be exposed and condemned. In a letter to the Minister for Resources regarding the 1995 woodchip export licences, Senator Faulkner said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In preparing my advice I have been rigorous in identifying forests of high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>This is utter rubbish. Senator Faulkner based his whole assessment of the 1,300 compartments set aside for protection on flawed information prepared by groups with a vested interest. The lack of scientific scrutiny and objective assessment in the process of his recommendation is entirely indefensible. To have the environmental lobby advising the minister on areas set aside for logging is like allowing animal liberationists to advise on our meat export industry. It is no wonder timber workers feel once again they have been duped and deceived by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner has used stooges in an attempt to undermine this vital industry. This whole process has been the great forest lotto of the century. The trouble for this minister and the government is that he has not been able to hide the evidence. It is really sloppy stuff from a tired government trapped into trying to pacify a vocal minority&mdash;a minority which is propagating deliberate lies by portraying woodchipping as public enemy No. 1&mdash;and the whole timber industry suffers as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over its chequered history the timber industry has had to undergo the most stringent scrutiny of any industry in Australia's history. Hundreds of timber studies have been carried out&mdash;by scientists and qualified professionals, I might add. The misinformation and plain lies regarding woodchipping that have received headlines in recent weeks need to be addressed. It was heartening to read the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Saturday. This article told the true story of the whole sorry and farcical episode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If every picture tells a story, it is the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Forest evaluation is a complicated issue but the facts speak for themselves. What needs to be done is to have the public correctly and honestly informed. Senator Faulkner has fostered the grossly distorted image portrayed by the radical environmentalists of the timber and forest industries. They would have the public believe all timber is for woodchip processing. We need to repeatedly point out and put on the record that woodchips are produced from sawmill waste, silvicultural thinnings or low grade logs from normal harvesting. Woodchips are a by-product of the sawlog industry used for building and furniture. This by-product earns Australia around $450 million each year in export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the current trade figures released today, with the current account blowing out to a record $2.4 billion, we should be supporting our export industries that bring much needed export dollars to our shores. If this waste was not turned into woodchip most of it would be burnt or left on the ground of the forests, thereby inhibiting future regrowth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to Mr Keating's decision. Undermining his resources minister's assessment and decision, the Prime Minister decided to step in and pluck 511&mdash;not 509, Mr Keating cannot count; we all know that&mdash;compartments out of Senator Faulkner's hit list in the hope of appeasing the Greens. But didn't the Prime Minister realise that this would not make the Greens happy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing will make the Greens happy until the whole industry is shut down. Your own backbench realises that&mdash;Mr Barry Cunningham, Mrs Smith and Mr Graeme Campbell realise that&mdash;and I should imagine that Senator Collins, the minister responsible for agriculture, realises that. The radical Green agenda is to completely close down the logging of native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a further look at the so-called high conservation areas that are being set aside for further assessment. My state of New South Wales has 249 forest compartments listed out of the 511 Australia wide. New South Wales state forest records show that some 196 of the 249 compartments have a history of logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take an example of one of these compartments. I bring to the minister's attention compartment 2329 in the Glenbog state forest near Eden. The first half of this compartment was logged in 1977, a part was selectively logged in 1984, several selective loggings for sawlogs were made from the 1920s to the late 1970s and the 1968 and 1977 regrowth was thinned in 1994&mdash;and this was after part clearing for highway construction. I would call this a predominantly regrowth forest, and I am sure that everybody else would too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not our Prime Minister. No, Mr Keating set this compartment aside. He set it aside as being of high conservation value. This government is selling out an industry on fundamentally flawed information and just plain lies. This government is selling out the livelihood of thousands of hardworking Australians in rural and regional Australia. This government is selling out on the Australian principle of a fair go for all. This government is selling out on much needed and important export dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the national forest policy statement was agreed to and signed by the Prime Minister and all state governments. It is an agreement, a contract. But only the states are playing by the rules. The industry is still awaiting the federal government's criteria in regard to the moratorium clause on old growth forests that are likely to have high conservation value. It is the Commonwealth that is dragging the chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the national forest policy statement is to end controversy and achieve uniformity and balance in the long-term interests of the timber industry and responsible conservation. I urge Senator Faulkner to get on track with the NFPS to end this controversy and achieve uniformity and balance in the long-term interests of the timber industry and responsible conservation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are profound political changes happening on the other side of the Pacific. Those profound political changes will also, if they come to fruition, usher in profound economic changes, not just for the United States but for every government around the world that is faced with the prospect of borrowing money. The Republican Party in the United States is advocating a constitutional change that will require Congress and the President to present a balanced budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may ask why that should be an issue of concern to us in Australia. The answer is very simple. We live in a world of complex and sophisticated global capital markets and the investors who lend their money to the United States government today may well be the investors who choose to lend their money to the Australian government tomorrow. It is simply a matter of fact that, if the United States federal government is forced by virtue of constitutional change to run a balanced budget, it then follows that countries like Australia&mdash;during the period which I have been in parliament, it has had a government, a Labor government, which has not once run a budgetary surplus or had a balanced budget but has, for every one of the last five years, run a budgetary deficit&mdash;which continue to live on the never-never will pay an increasingly exorbitant price for their borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An international investor faced with the prospect of lending to a country which exercises some sort of financial constraint, some sort of responsibility in fiscal terms, or lending to a country like Australia which is fiscally irresponsible, will always choose to lend to the responsible country at the same interest rate. Countries like Australia that are fiscally irresponsible&mdash;countries that live on the never-never; that is, they live on the national credit card, as the Keating Labor government would have us do&mdash;will have to pay a higher and higher interest rate as time goes on in order to seduce those investors to take the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who live in Australia cannot turn our back on changes overseas. We must be aware that, if the United States Congress votes to implement constitutional change, if it votes to require a balanced US federal budget, it will have the effect of increasing borrowing costs for governments in Australia. There is a very real reason why this issue should be of foremost importance to this parliament. At this very moment almost $100 billion worth of Commonwealth securities are on issue. That is the level of the Commonwealth government's indebtedness as we sit here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year alone the Commonwealth government's public sector borrowing requirement&mdash;that is, the deficit plus the money that will mature that has to be rolled over&mdash;is some $20.4 billion. So that is the level of exposure to interest rate change this year. Ultimately, much of that $100 billion or thereabouts will have to be rolled over, refinanced, if we continue to run budgetary deficits, and of course it will be added to. That is the extent of our risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you talk about a one per cent change in interest rates on $100 billion worth of debt, you are talking about an additional $1 billion of interest burden that not the government but the taxpayers have to meet. It is the taxpayers, not the government, who meet the costs. It is the ordinary Australians who bear the price when Labor and its administration is so financially irresponsible. That is the concern that this parliament should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is also a wider concern which should be shared by every single Australian voter and every Australian taxpayer: a decade in the 1980s of mainly Labor state administration has left many of our states which ought to be paragons of financial virtue in almost penury. We only have to look at the parlous state of the finances in Victoria to see exactly what Labor does when it is given a free hand with the public purse. It throws the money away and then begs the taxpayers to pick up the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electors of this country will be faced in the very near future with a number of state elections. There will be one in New South Wales this year, perhaps another one in Queensland this year or early next year and possibly a federal election in the next 12 to 18 months. The electors must ask themselves this question: do they trust Labor with the finances of their state and with the finances of their country? The answer must surely be that Labor is not worthy of trust because its track record has shown it to be financially irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the government's financial irresponsibility we see in Victoria through lost jobs and lost opportunities. But the cost of its financial irresponsibility of the future, if these changes occur in the United States, will be far greater because the cost of paying for Labor's borrowings will be so much higher. That is why I say that we must have an end to the way Labor throws money out to its friends all over the place; we must have an end to the way Labor wastes the workers' dollar, the taxpayers' cheque; we must have a return to responsibility in fiscal matters; and we must have an end to the sorts of budgetary deficits that Labor has produced year after year but for what benefit? The answer is, for no benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the benefit to Australia of the billions and billions of dollars that Labor has wasted over the five years in which I have been in parliament, of the billions and billions of dollars that we have been forced to borrow? Has it been of benefit to the hundreds of thousands of unemployed? The answer is no&mdash;they are still unemployed. Is the benefit to the wellbeing of the future generations of Australians? Again the answer is no. Young Australians still grapple with the prospect of very difficult to obtain places in tertiary education and then, even after they have completed tertiary education, the struggle to find a job in the work force outside the university gates. That is the legacy of Labor&mdash;a legacy of despair. It is a legacy of despair which has cost this nation and this nation's taxpayers billions and billions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nation as a whole, in addition to the government's own debt, has been faced with crippling foreign debt. It is faced with hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign debt&mdash;a foreign debt some eight or nine times the foreign debt that this country had when Labor came to office in 1983. Yet, we had the macabre spectacle of Senator Gareth Evans leering over the table in question time, berating those of us on this side of the chamber and saying that we are scaremongers because we raise the fact that this nation's foreign debt is twice the foreign debt of Mexico&mdash;and Senator Evans says, `Don't worry about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We raise the fact that our foreign debt is twice what it was in 1986 when the then Treasurer gave us the banana republic warning, and we are now told not to worry about it. If we should not worry about the foreign debt now, when it is twice what it was in 1986, why should it have been necessary to issue a warning in 1986 in the first place? There you see Labor's failure to grasp the reality of the financial quagmire in which this country finds itself: a total lack of reality, divorced from even the slightest semblance of the real world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign debt will cripple this country. Foreign debt at increasingly high rates of interest will cripple the future of my generation of Australians because it is my generation of Australians who will have to pay the price. It is my generation of Australians who suffer when this country pays an exorbitant interest bill overseas, because the money this nation pays away in interest is money that leaves these shores and it is money that could be creating jobs for young Australian men and women. But because that money has been sucked from our shores and sent overseas, the money that could have been spent in this country and that could have been creating jobs is lost to us forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do I say that this is important here today? It is important because we heard that the balance of payments deficit has blown out of all proportion&mdash;$2.4 billion seasonally adjusted for December. It is the highest balance of payments deficit on record, and the government is blissfully ignorant of the consequences. That is $2.4 billion further that this nation is in debt. That is $2.4 billion in just one month on which my generation of Australians will have to pay the debt. It is not right for Senator Evans and the government to come in here with the blithe excuses that we had today: `Well, it is just another lot of one-off transactions.' This month it is a liquid natural gas ship; last month it was a jumbo jet; the month before that it was two 737s. A series of one-off transactions month after month after month does not become a one-off trend; it becomes the norm. The norm is that this country is sinking further into debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excuses you heard from Senator Evans were the same excuses you heard in the 1980s and the 1970s from every tin-pot dictator in Latin America, from every tin-pot dictator from Mexico to Argentina. I know that because, at the end of the 1980s, my job in London was to deal with the legacy of Latin American debt; to extract the price from Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela. Let me say that I do not want to see happen to this country what happened to Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. If we follow the blithe excuses of the government, that is exactly what will happen. How can we hold our heads up high in the international community and say, `We are one of the greatest debtor nations on earth'? If the truth is told, that is the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for Senator Evans to say it is a series of one-off transactions, nor is it good enough for Senator Evans to come into this chamber and say, `Look, we do not have to worry about the level of debt provided we can keep on paying it.' It is patently obvious that we cannot keep on paying the bill. If you or I went to the bank manager and said, `I know I have overdrawn by $60,000, but I can still keep on paying the interest,' that would not be an acceptable explanation. At the end of the day, somehow and at some time, you have to repay the principal, and the same applies to a company or to a country. It is not good enough to say, `I can pay the interest this month.' When are you going to repay the debt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When is my generation going to be called upon to repay the debt which has been incurred by the folly of those who sit opposite? That is the question we should ask, and that is a question which fills me with trepidation. It may not fill Senator Evans with trepidation, but it fills me with trepidation. Those glib excuses were the excuses that were given in Latin America 20 years ago and the excuses that failed. Finally, on the issue of debt, I do not think it acceptable for Senator Evans to come up with one of the most  ridiculous excuses of all time&mdash;the weather. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest single failing of this government over the past 10 or 12 years is that it has allowed our national debt, through a conglomeration of policies and events, to blow out to the extent that it has. What the government has done is transfer what should have been part of our pain to our children and our grandchildren. That is the disappointment and the disgrace of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the matters relating to the problems we have in this country right now. I mentioned interest rates and debt. I will not go over them again. I go back to the one area that this government has not been prepared to address in a meaningful, proper way. I refer to industrial relations reform. In the debate just over 12 months ago I issued a couple of warnings about the legislation at that time. I want to repeat them. We have a piece of industrial legislation now in which we have a series of cases in the various courts around this land and a number of them in the High Court. At that time I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that time there was no concern about the ILO conventions or the right of freedom of association from the opposite side of the chamber nor from the end of the chamber. Once again, much of this bill is based on the selective use of conventions and much of it will end up in the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that point: much of it will end up in the High Court. I also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must never forget that when we put up legislation we have a responsibility in this place to try to avoid the lengthy cases and the drawn out situations which arrive from things being taken to the High Court. There is no doubt that this legislation will end up in the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA>I further went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they want a lawyer-led recovery, they are going the right way about it, not only in terms of this legislation but also the legislation that we will be dealing with either tomorrow or the next day&mdash;the Mabo legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to re-emphasise that point because a series of legislation we have presented and dealt with in this place over the last 18 months&mdash;particularly those based on the use, or misuse, of ILO conventions&mdash;are ending up in the courts. They are going to cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions and millions of dollars to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is about overriding the constitutional and sovereign rights of the states. It is about overriding the freedom of association&mdash;the right to choose to belong to an organisation or a union. This legislation&mdash;and I will deal with a couple of cases in relation to this in a moment&mdash;overrode the freedoms which we should expect to exist in a democratic country such as Australia. This is highlighted by the fact that we see a number of the state governments, including my state of Western Australia, taking the legislation to the High Court because it overrides the constitutional responsibilities of Western Australia and other states. It interferes with their freedoms under our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other cases that relate to this issue. The Asahi case has had a lot of publicity in recent times. A commissioner ordered the people there to have a union involved in their activities, even though they chose as individuals not to belong to a union and even though they chose as individuals&mdash;collectively, as I understand it&mdash;not to have union representation in terms of negotiating their particular agreements. They were forced to do it. Their freedom was taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That interferes dramatically with the capacity to reform because people will not allow themselves to be put in a position where they are dictated to by third parties&mdash;whether it be an organisation of employers, an organisation in the form of a union or an industrial tribunal. That is the nature of the beast. Australians are very independent people. Until such time as the government realises that and removes the impediments which currently exist in the act, cases like Asahi will continue&mdash;make no mistake about it. I issued that warning at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the Bay Bell situation in Tasmania. Bay Bell is a subsidiary of CRA. What do we find there? The company negotiated with sits employees, or the employees negotiated with the company&mdash;whichever way you want to put it. What happened? The Industrial Relations Commission stepped in and introduced a paid rates award. That case is now being appealed in the High Court. It has caused an enormous amount of insecurity in terms of employment. But it is worse than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, it takes away the freedom of individuals to determine their own destiny in a fair and democratic country. That situation is covered by another part of the act and is once again administered through the commission. That power in the act is totally inappropriate. If the employees and the employers at Bay Bell wish to negotiate between themselves and come to a conclusion, that should be their right. If they wish to use the appropriate union, that should be their right. If they wish to use the local doctor to negotiate on their behalf, that should be their right. But they must have that freedom of association. Once again I emphasise that particular point: until that impediment, that restriction, that interference with liberty is removed from the Industrial Relations Act, we will not get proper industrial reform in this country. It will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I want to deal with the situation of the hospital workers in Western Australia. They have been forced, once again through this Industrial Relations Act, to move out of the workplace contracts which they agreed would operate in Western Australia&mdash;to their benefit and to make the system more efficient. They have been forced to come in under a federal award. That is nothing short of a disgrace. The first four cases I have mentioned are all back in the Industrial Relations Court and three of them will end up in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot run a country with legislation that is going to end up in the High Court. As Senator O'Chee and other speakers have said here today, you cannot address the national debt and become truly productive in an internationally competitive sense. It is no good saying that we are productive just because we have improved from where we were before. It is like a cricket match where one side makes 200 runs in the first innings and the other side makes 150 runs, and then the first side makes 200 runs in the second innings and the second side makes 160 runs. You have still lost the game. That is what is happening to our productivity in terms of international competition. This government must recognise the mistakes, the faults, which exist in the act. It needs to make sure that the rhetoric in industrial relations policy in this country matches the legislation and that the legislation in fact addresses what we need to do to overcome our particular problem&mdash;our boom-bust scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are many challenges currently in Australia. But, in my view, the key challenge, the most important one, is to address the impediments which exist in the workplace to create a more harmonious, productive, competitive workplace which will allow us to outperform those countries that we compete with, because we continue to be left behind. </PARA>

As I understand, we will not be dividing on it. I would particularly like to thank all the senators who have made a contribution to this debate. As I understand, there has been a request that the debate not be finalised until the estimates hearings are concluded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the part that I am concerned about because really this is totally new subject matter. The first bill that was debated and dealt with in both chambers concerned Australia's relationship with an International War Crimes Tribunal that had been set up to deal with matters arising out of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. It now seems that by amendment at this stage in this place the government is seeking to engage Australia under similar terms and conditions in another tribunal&mdash;the International War Crimes Tribunal&mdash;which has been set up to look at matters arising out of the conflict in Rwanda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with this is in many ways procedural because I have not had time to consider the substance of the government's argument. As I understand it, it was only in the very recent past, perhaps yesterday, that the request that we include Rwanda and change the first bill to refer to `tribunals' instead of `tribunal' was brought to our attention. There may be matters that really do require separate consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, on our side, within the last week or so, Senator MacGibbon, together with the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), visited Rwanda and may have a viewpoint, that I would like to know of, as to whether Australia should engage with this tribunal under exactly the same terms and conditions. I would also very much like to know the view of my colleague Senator Herron who, assisting in a medical capacity, spent six weeks or longer&mdash;several months, I think it was&mdash;in Rwanda during the conflict. He may well have strong views on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also not sure whether the tribunal that has been set up to address abuses arising out of the Rwandan conflict is identical to that which was set up to deal with former Yugoslavia. I am aware that the Security Council has passed a resolution and set up a tribunal&mdash;and, as a good internationalist, I accept that there might be responsibilities arising from that resolution which Australia wants to assume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I am uncomfortable with dealing with this at this time without us having had the opportunity to consider it properly. I am worried; if we take that attitude, are we holding up something that is critically important? I do not know the answer to that. I would be much more comfortable, my chronology of parliamentary events being correct, if this amendment were dealt with next week, after our shadow ministry and our party room have had the opportunity to consider these amendments. However, in saying so, I would not like to be giving the slightest hint that we might oppose it; we just want to do the job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I will listen to what the minister's explanation is for this unusual process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of things I can say in response to the concerns raised by Senator Hill and Senator Spindler. I ask the committee to keep in mind that what we are doing here is not bringing in a new structure, a new principal or a new regime. The proposed amendments in relation to the Rwandan bill overwhelmingly do one thing; that is, of course, to extend the operation, which has been developed in the amended legislation in this place and the House of Representatives, to the situation in Rwanda. So the structure will be the same. There are in that second bill some further amendments, but they are basically amendments to correct deficiencies in the drafting of the substantial bills. So we have the same structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government feels that it is important to act in respect of the Rwandan tribunal. On 8 November 1994, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 955, which established the Rwandan tribunal.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have that found out whilst I am talking. So the genesis is the same. It is an identical resolution which establishes both. The resolutions in relation to both tribunals&mdash;and this is, in fact, the driving force for the government's actions here&mdash;create immediately binding obligations on member states of the United Nations, which include Australia, of course, to cooperate and comply with requests for assistance from the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can be said about it? We can say that we are setting up the same structure. We are setting that structure up to pursue war crimes in Rwanda. We are not introducing new principles, concepts or whatever. We are doing so in pursuance of our international obligations. The alternative to this, of course&mdash;were we not to be introducing this at the earliest stage possible this year&mdash;would be to bring in another bill; that is, another bill which would be doing what the second part of the government amendments are doing now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To us, given the fact that there is no difference in the structures and mechanisms of the former Yugoslavia tribunal and the Rwanda tribunal which we are talking about, it makes good sense to be able to deal with them both at this particular stage. There is no conceivable, good reason as to why we would go through this twice when we could go through it once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the motivation to do it earlier, firstly, there is that process; and, secondly, we do have, under the UN resolution, an immediately binding obligation as a member state. So we feel that it is best that we do this as soon as possible rather than let it drag on, particularly as there are no policy reasons to necessitate deferral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if we were setting up a new structure or designing new legislation; it is not as though we have to go through a Senate committee process to develop a structure.

In fact, the mere point that this bill has not yet passed in relation to former Yugoslavia is an indication of how urgent these matters are. It is not as though, I presume, the government has some list of alleged war criminals in Australia that the tribunal has made, which it is requesting from us.

But what you are doing, if you do insist on proceeding with this today, is asking the rest of the chamber to take it on word&mdash;unless you have speed readers&mdash;that, for example, the statute of the Rwandan tribunal is not the same as the statute of the tribunal with respect to Yugoslavia. Are we not to be entitled to the opportunity to compare the two and see whether there is a difference, and whether any differences that may be there require some other changes to be made, for example, dealing with different types of crimes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone might think there is a higher requirement for an appeal that might have been passed up in the original legislation or whatever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any bad will or desire to mess things up. I wonder how long the government has known that it has wanted to do this and whether Senator Spindler had notice earlier than I did. It just does not seem the way to handle this. There isn't any bad will here, Senator Bolkus; there is just a desire to do the job properly. </PARA>

Just accept these amendments, and Rwanda will be included.' But, like Senator Hill, I would like to hear what Senator MacGibbon and Senator Herron have to say. Is the conflict in Rwanda different? Are we going to move similar amendments every time there is another conflict overseas? Yugoslavia, Rwanda&mdash;what next? Are we setting a precedent so that you can just come in here and say, `Another tribunal has been set up. Let's just stick this on to this bill'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no desire to delay it. In fact, I had it in my head that we had already dealt with this. It has been on the list so many times and then been called off for one or another reason. One hesitates to have that happen again, but the proper thing for you to do is to give us the opportunity to make the proper comparison and discuss it with our colleagues. You cannot just announce on Tuesday that on Wednesday you would like to make a change which you say is small but which might, in the end, be quite dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, there is no bad will, but what is the problem with leaving it until week two or three so that we can consult our party colleagues? Senator Spindler finds it easy to consult his party because there are so few of them. On this side of the chamber it is a bit more difficult to give everybody the opportunity. You should not run a party by what the shadow minister and the leader say. You should have the opportunity to consult with your colleagues, and you should welcome that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is the sort of bill that comes on every session. I am told by the Attorney-General's Department that it has so many amendments that it would like to make to particular bills that we can count on having one of these bills in every session almost for the rest of my parliamentary time. I plan on that being extensive, so there must be very substantial amendments to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with a number of things. It makes amendments to tidy up the messy Security Appeals Tribunal by shifting it into the AAT, and makes some subsequent changes. It contains some amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act, the Federal Court Act and a few others. The opposition has some concerns about a number of those amendments, not the least of which are the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill inserts a reading down provision which provides that, if a statutory provision could be read as having a particular application which would exceed Commonwealth power and can be read as having a valid application, the parliament intended that the provision should only have the valid application. This comes about because of a series of cases, including one of the recent Migration Act cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the High Court found the invalid applications of such provisions to be inseverable and therefore has found the provisions wholly invalid. The new section will provide that if a provision in its application to a particular person, thing or circumstance would exceed Commonwealth power but would validly apply to another particular person, thing or circumstance, the parliament intended that the provision should not have the invalid application but should have the valid application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way to explain that&mdash;and this might come from one of the cases&mdash;is that the clause which says that a court will not order a release of someone in custody reads as `anyone in custody', including illegally detained people. That would be stupid and improper for a variety of reasons, so we must have meant that it meant that only illegally detained people could be allowed out, and the whole thing got messed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This just does not seem the right way to go about it. If ordinary Joe Blow, whom I hope we have not lost sight of, picks up the bill and says, `What does this mean? Does it mean XYZ?', we should not, because of messy drafting, be saying, `It doesn't mean XYZ; it means only X because Y and Z are outside Commonwealth power.' We should not be doing that. We should be trying to get the legislation to reflect what we want to do that is within Commonwealth power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this will make it easier for everybody, especially for us. It will certainly make it easier for the drafters. We are not saying that in the end there is necessarily another way out of this. We are saying that we would like the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to look at it and that we would like to hear from experts in drafting to see whether this is the lazy person's way out or whether there is a better way to fix this problem. That is the first point that we would like to raise as a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also like to mention the amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. The bill amends that act to provide for a review on a question of law of awards made in arbitration. These amendments will allow for questions of law to be referred to the court where a matter has been referred to arbitration but there has not been an award made in respect of that arbitration. The arbitrator can apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consulted the Law Council about this matter, it had some concern. Let me add that, in principle, it supported the changes to the legislation, giving an arbitrator to whom a matter had been referred power to apply to the court for leave to refer to a question of law, but it did consider that this provision was unduly restrictive and that the litigant should be able to make such an application personally in the way that such applications are contemplated by the provisions of section 39 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 of Victoria, which I understand is reasonably uniform legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was also raised about the provisions of section 53AB because they are different from and out of step with that uniform legislation. The proposed legislation gives a right of appeal from an arbitrator's award to a party to an award. Uniform legislation does not give such a right but it allows an appeal with either the consent of all parties or the leave of a court. Furthermore, the court cannot give such leave unless it is satisfied that there is a manifest error of law on the face of the award or that there is strong evidence that the arbitrator made an error of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, we think the question of uniformity is worth looking at. There may be some good reasons why the Commonwealth has drafted it this way and why following the Law Council's suggestion is unacceptable. We are not in any retractable position here. We would simply like to hear what the government has to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point relates to changes to the Security Appeals Tribunal and in particular to section 39A(9)(b), which has been described by some as draconian and unnecessary. This provision purports to exclude a person representing an applicant when evidence is given or submissions are made which are the subject of a minister's certificate given under that section unless the responsible minister consents. The imposition of a criminal sanction on persons breaching confidentiality by 39A(10) should be a sufficient deterrent for wrongful disclosure. More particularly, the exclusion of representatives is considered to be an unwarranted impairment of procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a good and reasonable point to make. If the applicant can be there, why does the Commonwealth assume that you can trust the applicant any more than you can trust the representative? I do not want to waste time nitpicking with members on the other side, but we are familiar with the constant lawyer bashing on the other side by now Minister Schacht, Peter Walsh, et al. There seems to be this constant assumption that you have to keep lawyers out; that you cannot trust them. For what other reason would you exclude them? There may be good reasons, and we would like to hear them. For that reason, we support a request by the Democrats to the Selection of Bills Committee that this matter be referred to a Friday committee. They may have other or additional concerns that they want to look at, but they are the ones that we want to look it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that in principle we are not drastically opposed. There is not some wall that we want to go to in this respect. But the comments made, particularly those by the Law Council, deserve a decent answer delivered in such a way that gives us time to consider it. That is why proceeding and moving amendments here and there in the committee stage where we get hardly any time to consider whether the answer given by the minister is satisfactory is not satisfactory. We support the reference to the Friday com mittee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). That bill is an omnibus bill which aims to abolish the Security Appeals Tribunal currently established under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and transfer its jurisdiction to a newly created division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also seeks to insert a reading down provision into the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. It seeks to amend the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 to give effect to the recommendations of the report of the review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It seeks to amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to provide for a review on a question of law of awards made in arbitration and it also seeks to make some other minor amendments to the Judiciary Act 1903. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support much of the bill. However, we believe that a number of areas which give us concern would benefit from a closer examination. We have therefore referred the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and are grateful for the support given to that move by the opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turning to some of the more significant features of the bill, I deal first of all with the Security Appeals Tribunal which is to be abolished. Instead, the bill creates a security appeals division in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Security Appeals Tribunal was established under the ASIO Act 1979. Its function is to review adverse or qualified security assessments of a person made by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Such assessments are those which contain `any opinion or advice or any information that is or could be prejudicial to the interests of the person'. Security assessments are made by ASIO, typically at the request of the Commonwealth agency heads, on individuals whose work involves access to information or areas to which access is controlled or limited on security grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of security assessments undertaken by ASIO has decreased in recent times, perhaps partly as a result of the fact that Commonwealth agencies are increasingly relying on their own security guidelines and are not requesting assessments from ASIO. For example, we understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes security assessments of its own. The weakness here, however, is that the Security Appeals Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to review departmental security assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation suggested that the proposal to incorporate the Security Appeals Tribunal into a new security division of the AAT `could provide an opportunity for a re-examination of the basis on which decisions concerning access can be reviewed and suggested that the Security Appeals Tribunal or the new division of the AAT could be given jurisdiction to hear appeals for any person aggrieved by an access decision made by the head of an agency'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government rejected this suggestion on the grounds that avenues for review by the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Ombudsman already existed under the Public Service regulations.

<PARA>One of the great challenges for Australian primary industry is to ensure that our products, especially wool and cotton, are able to compete in a world market which is being continually inundated by synthetics. That is why the work of the Cotton Research and Development Corporation is so very important, especially now that a whole range of synthetic clothing brands and types is coming out which is claimed to have some environmental value. For example, one can even purchase something called `Ecofleece'. It is a synthetic which is supposed to be made out of recycled plastic bottles. I do not quite understand how, but I am told that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, nothing is really comparable with a natural product for so many purposes. That is why, in terms of cotton, we have a lot to offer the world. Certainly Australian cotton is of a standard that can compete with the very finest grown anywhere in the world. Classers of cotton who are honest will say that Australian cotton is as good as anything grown in, for example, the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems for cotton producers is that, whilst we produce the cotton here, often the fabric is spun overseas. A frequent complaint one hears about cotton is that it shrinks with use and washing. There is a reason for that. Frequently, especially in the case of T-shirts, the fabric is stretched prior to being used in the manufacturing process. So naturally with a bit of wear and washing the cotton tends to shrink. Unfortunately, it can sometimes give cotton garments a bad reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take this opportunity to highlight the fact that there are efforts being made by Australian industry to improve the end product from our cotton. I particularly take this opportunity to highlight some of the work that is being done by an Australian company called the Bushco Farming Company. It is a supplier of high quality cotton garments, such as cotton knitted sweaters. This year, I understand that it is producing the cotton knitted sweaters that go into Ralph Lauren's polo range. So it really shows that Australian garments are some of the finest in the world. That is something about which we should all be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mark Coulton and the Bushco Farming Company are trying to control the entire process. Their objective is to control the growing of the cotton right through to its becoming part of the finished product. So they will be able to say, `The cotton in these pullovers here came from this row on this farm.' That means that they will have total quality control and will not be dependent on people overseas. They will be able to control the whole manufacturing process and guarantee a uniformally high quality product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing they are doing when they are not producing cotton knitted sweaters is producing cotton tampons that are free from chemical residue so that those who use them know that they are absolutely safe. That is also testimony to a certain degree of lateral thinking, which will pay off for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Cotton Research and Development Corporation is important. The work of private industry in trying to capitalise on what comes out of the corporation is also important. We need creative people who are going to be involved in farming and processing and in using the fabric to ensure that there is a long-term viable future in cotton for every producer. That long-term viable future in cotton means long-term profitability for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that we should all spare a thought for some of our dry land cotton producers who will not be getting a crop this year. I particularly refer to some on the Darling Downs, who are very fine people. I have picked cotton with them in previous seasons, which has been a great joy to me. I only hope that the next season for those dry land farmers will be better. They deserve a good go. The cotton they produce earns export dollars. We will all be better off for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;A reading of the Tobacco Research and Development Council annual report indicates that the tobacco industry is in decline. The 1993-94 allocation to research and development projects has been reduced 16 per cent on the previous year. Next year, there will be a further decline in R&amp;D funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco research is carried out at the Southedge research station at Mareeba and at the Ovens research station near Myrtleford in Victoria. The paper indicates that 45 per cent of tobacco growing costs are in employment, with irrigation, fertiliser and pest and disease control forming a further 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco industry has been a large employer of people in the Mareeba district, where it has poured something like $55 million into the town on a yearly basis. The decline of the industry has caused massive problems in Mareeba and, no doubt, Myrtleford, although I do not represent that area. Suffice it to say that the tobacco industry is one of the smaller primary industries that have been badly affected by the Uruguay Round and the subsequent reorganisation of the World Trade Organisation that occurred from 1 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quotas were erroneously worked out. Even Senator McMullan is prepared to concede that the reductions of imports were worked out on the very high 1986-88 levels. Even Senator McMullan concedes that they were wrong. The consequence of that decision is that 11,184 tonnes of tobacco will come into Australia, which represents 70 to 80 per cent of Australia's total production. Therefore, it will be almost impossible to sustain the current number of farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland 50 per cent of tobacco farmers will be lost to the industry. Fortunately for the ones who remain an agreement has been worked out with the tobacco industry that it will maintain and enter into long-term contracts with the remaining tobacco farmers. The new tobacco plan involves all imports being duty free from 1 January 1995. That was the concession the government made to the tobacco industry for supporting the tobacco farmers. The local leaf content scheme and the tobacco industry stabilisation scheme will cease from 1 January 1995 and funding from manufacturers and state governments will cease. Australian manufacturers will contribute $10.8 million to a continuation of local supply and the state governments of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria will also assist some of the manufacturers. Longer term agreements between growers and manufacturers will come into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to see an industry in demise. Nevertheless one has to face reality. The government has gone some way in removing tariffs that will assist the local cigarette manufacturing industry. Many people will benefit from GATT but it also has to be recognised that there is a down side for some of the smaller primary industries. Citrus is one and tobacco is another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the opportunity of this adjournment debate to address a controversial section of the Income Tax Assessment Act, namely section 264A. This deals with information notices. Honourable senators may recall that that section was inserted into the Income Tax Assessment Act during 1991. However, I again remind the Senate that its insertion was the subject at the time of some controversy and was not without some resistance from the coalition. There were serious concerns at the time about its constitutionality and the delegation of powers to the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the section allows the commissioner to issue an offshore information notice requesting a taxpayer to provide information held outside Australia relevant to the taxpayer's income tax assessment. It enables the commissioner to request information or documents where there is reason to believe that they are held outside Australia and are relevant. The consequence of a taxpayer refusing or failing to comply with such a notice is that the information or documents are not admissible in proceedings disputing the taxpayer's assessment unless the commissioner consents to their admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate of Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990, which inserted a section, I expressed great concern about that provision. I think those comments are worth repeating tonight:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another objectionable aspect of the bill is its evidentiary rule regarding offshore information notices. The coalition sought to remove this provision because it believed that there were other adequate provisions in the act to cope with section 264A situations. The opposition does not believe in giving draconian powers to government when there are adequate measures elsewhere in the act, especially in view of the constitutional and other issues that proposed section 264A raises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the onus of proof is already heavily on the taxpayer in dispute over tax assessment, why should the courts be prevented from examining all the evidence? Parliament has in fact amended the Acts Interpretation Act to enable courts to look at extrinsic aids interpretation of legislation. Why should we now seek to prevent the courts from reading all the relevant information? The doctrine of the separation of legislative and judicial powers does appear in this legislation to be going at something of a discount.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently the constitutionality of section 264A has been under scrutiny by the Federal Court of Australia. I feel somewhat vilified in this since I predicted that there were provisions including constitutionality. I remind the Senate that from my perspective I do not raise concerns about provisions in the bills just as debating points. My contribution is expressed in the hope that the government will listen and rectify the problems that the coalition raised. In the recent F. H. Faulding versus Federal Commissioner decision, the Federal Court held that the provisions of section 264A were not invalid under the constitution. But the court did set aside a section 264A notice on the basis that the notice was beyond the commissioner's power and invalid for uncertainty. In doing so, the court considers certain requests in the notice were beyond the commissioner's authority because they were either not relevant to the assessment or too widely drafted to actually be certain. Further, the court held that the request for Fauldings to require a third party to make a statement to the Australian Taxation Office was beyond the commissioner's power under section 264A.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that decision can be appealed by the government, both the government and the Tax Office must take careful notice of what the Federal Court actually said. While the court upheld the constitutional validity of the section, which from my perspective was somewhat disappointing, the decision shows that the commissioner must be very careful in drafting section 264A notices. One can only take solace in the fact that the courts will not allow the section to be used carte blanche by the Commissioner of Taxation without reference to the specific powers given. However, I remind the Senate of a comment made by Simon Crean MP in a second reading speech in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to issue an offshore information notice in respect of information or documents held offshore. Where the information or documents are not supplied, there is no provision for a penalty or prosecution. Rather, the information or documents may not be used by a taxpayer as evidence to a dispute in an assessment. The approach adopted in this provision is similar to that taken in the United States and Canadian tax laws and is aimed at ensuring the timely provision of all the information and documents needed by the commissioner to get the full and correct picture of the transaction being examined. In view of the significance of such a provision, the operation of the proposed section 264A will be kept under review&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>They are the operative words to which I am addressing my comments tonight because that review, I believe, is necessary&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to ensure that its objectives are met and the rights of affected taxpayers are adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that final statement, I strongly recommend that both the Treasurer and the Commissioner of Taxation take serious interest in the substance of the finding of the Faulding decision before the Federal Court. We must all be concerned when the commissioner is able to demand information from taxpayers where there are other options available to obtain this information. The Faulding decision is unlikely to be the last time that the courts will be required to examine section 264A. That section is likely to be the subject of further challenges in the future&mdash;on unconstitutional, mode of service, administrative law and privilege, such as privilege against self-incrimination and legal professional privilege&mdash;grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is opportune to remind the Senate that recently the Law Council of Australia raised concern about the potential erosion of legal professional privilege in a bill which is familiar to the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)&mdash;the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994. Fortunately, the courts have repeatedly upheld on public policy grounds the concept of legal professional privilege as a very vital element in our justice system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I use the opportunity of this adjournment debate tonight to suggest to the government and the Commissioner of Taxation that they give further consideration to the necessity of having this at times repulsive or draconian section which has such a serious bearing on taxpayers' rights. I cannot miss this opportunity to again draw the attention of the Senate to the need to have this charter of taxpayers' rights not as an administrative document to adorn the walls of the Taxation Office but to be enshrined in legislation to give the full impact of the intent of an appropriate taxpayers' right the full legislative force that it really requires. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

It has been very difficult today to find an opportunity to speak on this matter because so many people on this side of the chamber want to speak on it. Today question time was dominated by this matter, we had an urgency motion on the subject following question time, motions to take note of answers were taken up totally by the matter and then we had an MPI on it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our parliament now resembles a medieval castle under siege as the various interest groups vie for space to protest about the actions of this government. It is basically focusing on the environment and the resources area. Out the front there are transport workers and forest workers. The Greens are coming, I hear, in big numbers. The airport noise protesters have come in and, of course, the farmers have been here for quite some time. It is a great tribute to Australian democracy that these people are so restrained because what is at stake is their very livelihood, the way of life that has gone on for many generations in many families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was born on the south coast of New South Wales and spent my first nine years in the town of Eden. Eden is a timber town. Some of my earliest memories are of being out on camps with forest workers as they chopped trees down and helped create our massive forest industries. All of that is now under threat by the way in which this government has managed the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has this come about? It is not a recent matter. Debate over the use of forests&mdash;what we protect, what we develop as a renewable resource&mdash;has been going on for decades in this country. You would have thought that after 12 years a government would have a plan worked out, a regional resource management plan that would keep environmentalists and people in the timber industry happy. But it does not, and now it is into crisis management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is going to lead us out of this mess? We have Mr Beddall, who would have to be one of the most incompetent ministers in the lower house. Here in the Senate we have `Forrest Gump Faulkner', who is probably the most incompetent minister here, but he has a lot of competition. The ALP government stands guilty tonight of destroying the Australian timber industry as it reneges on agreements and promises made to the forest industry. Directly, there are 10,000 jobs at stake and, indirectly, far more, as the livelihood of many towns is totally dependent on this type of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forest and transport workers feel quite betrayed by this Labor government. They expressed that to me this morning as I was coming in. Recently I had an accident which has created great pain in my back. I mentioned to them on the way in that it was very difficult for people in pain coming into the parliament and we perhaps might take a jaundiced view of their issue if they kept making us do it. One of the workers replied to me, `Senator, your pain is temporary. In a few weeks time that will be gone. If we lose our jobs and our way of life our pain will be permanent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a blockade of this parliament. It is escalating as more people arrive. The anger can be seen on TV at night right around the nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mainstream opinion in Australia supports the view that old growth forests with environmental beauty and significance must be protected and preserved. No-one really argues with that proposition. We are all, as someone once coined it, light green. But what the dark greens, or the loony greens, must realise is that in a country that is very dependent on its primary resources we must allow an industry that works in a very responsible manner, as the timber industry does, on a renewable resource and on only a very small section of Australia's forests to flourish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a lot of people in the cities have a misconception about the forests of Australia. One of the advantages we have as Mps is that we fly over a lot of Australia. As someone who used to teach geography, I look down on the forests of Australia from the air. As you fly from the Queensland border to the Victorian border down the spine of New South Wales and the Great Divide there is a massive forest all the way down and from the air it is almost untouched. People just do not realise that there is so much forest out there. There are small areas that are being logged and they are being logged in a responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went back to my home town of Eden in 1986 and I went out to some of these areas that have been logged. Despite the greenie propaganda where you see all this desolate area, this area had a sign up that said `logged in 1972'. You looked up and you saw these tall trees that were about 60 to 70 feet high, and this was the regenerated growth. That area had been harvested, the country had earned wealth from it and now it is there ready to be cut again. There is a lot of propaganda around at the moment on what is being logged and what is not being logged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need not only to log the timber in these sorts of forests which are constantly being harvested every 20 years or so. This is an industry which can grow and expand. We can actually develop value added industries on top of this that create greater wealth in the country. But that will not happen if we lock up all the forests, which some people in this country want to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do this with a very deceptive campaign. They try to make out&mdash;a lot of people in the country believe this&mdash;that what is being woodchipped is really good timber. Any person in the timber industry who woodchips good timber has to be mad because it is worth a lot more if you mill it and turn it into housing or furniture. What is being milled is the waste, the offcuts. I will put it to the greenies what happens to this stuff if you do not turn it into woodchip. You build it up in a great big heap and you set it on fire. Then a lot of pollution goes up into the air. I thought these people were concerned about the environment. The sorts of policies they want will create greater problems for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also create greater problems for the economy if they go ahead with what they do. Even though we have a lot of timber in this country and we log it and mill it, we are still importing $2.7 billion worth of timber. Mr Keating today had enormous trouble with his balance of payments. Part of this could be solved if he allowed this to go ahead and allowed this industry to expand so we could cut down our imports of goods. </PARA>

Anyone who would want to invest at this stage in this industry, with its annual renewable licence system, would be mad. You could put millions of dollars into an industry and maybe next year this Labor government will change its mind and say that you cannot do it any more. All investment would go down the drain. Who would invest in that sort of situation? If they do not invest, whole towns will disappear. We are trying to keep rural and regional Australia there. People who want to live out there want to work there. We want them to stay there.

What absolute nonsense. A coupe in my state of Tasmania which had been logged three months ago all of a sudden has been declared as having some important heritage value that the Prime Minister says needs to be protected. We also have an airstrip that needs to be protected. It is quite clear that the government has been relying on the propaganda of the extreme Green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to comment on the very real effects that this sort of policy making has on the people of Australia. It is absolutely devastating to the families and the communities in regional Australia. I believe that the people of Australia are now learning with this forestry debate that the propaganda peddled by the environmentalists is not to be relied upon, is not truthful, contains misinformation and in fact is downright lacking in credit, as witnessed by the front-page photograph of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Tasmania there have been 17 inquiries into the forest industry as to what ought be happening within Tasmania's forest industry. As though those 17 inquiries are not enough, we have since had Senator Faulkner's inquiry into the coupes in Tasmania about which there has been a lot of debate today. It is unfortunate that the extremist environmentalists have the ear of the media. That is now slowly being eroded, and I think they have shot themselves in the foot over this forest industry debate that is being waged right around Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there is the debate in my state which now has prominence on the mainland concerning the draining of Lake Pedder. Lake Pedder, as it currently stands, is 240 square kilometres of pure rain water. In this drought affected country, I would have thought the prospect of draining that lake would not have been something that people would embrace. I say to people all around Australia who are so concerned about this forest industry that they should not be mistaken. The forest industry is the first industry. Next is Lake Pedder. Next will be the lakes, then iron ore mining and coalmining. Everything will be targeted by this extremist Green movement, which has no fixed agenda, which always moves its goalpost and which, if an item on its agenda is fulfilled, will add another two or three items onto that agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the creation of the new Lake Pedder, more and more platypuses have found a habitat in which to live. It may be of interest to those who peddle the `drain Lake Pedder' slogan that the draining of Lake Pedder would be responsible for the deaths of literally hundreds of platypuses in southern Tasmania. The water resource would not be there. They would starve to death and drown in the mud. So, if you want to `save' Lake Pedder, consider what you are going to do to the hundreds of platypuses that have now found a habitat there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should consider the four million trout that live within that lake and consider what will happen to the other industries that have now grown. For example, the Huon River used to be subject to flood. Apple growers in that region have in recent times been planting the flood plains of the Huon River with apple trees because they are now convinced that this new dam stops the flooding of the Huon River. If you were to remove that dam, what would occur? The floods would return and the industry of those apple farmers would be endangered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the aquaculture industry that is at the foot of the Huon River? The salmon industry is now very concerned about the `siltation' and other effects the draining of Lake Pedder will have on its industry. Once again we have something which started as a nice, warm inner glow in those who live in the suburbia of this great country and who have not been told of the real human impact these decisions will have, including the environmental impact and the slaughter of platypuses that would result. Something else that is interesting is that, if you were to drain Lake Pedder by using the valves that exist, it would take two years. The other method would be to demolish the dam. Of course, the dam would just allow flood waters to race down the Huon River and cause all sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania was promised that, if it did not dam the Franklin, there would be a huge boost in ecotourism. What is the situation now in Tasmania with the Franklin River? In 1993 we had the tremendous number of 203 rafters down that river. That was the great economic boom to Tasmania that was promised by the Greens. They promised thousands of jobs. We got 203 rafters down the river. What is interesting is considering where rafters now go if they want to raft in Tasmania. They go to the Hydro Electric Commission establishments which can control the flow of water. The Hydro Electric Commission, by agreement, releases sufficient waters for a sufficient period to allow the rafters to enjoy the rafting experience. So it is the Hydro Electric Commission that is combining with tourism to present and provide the rafting experience. That is the way we ought to be running our environment&mdash;by having sustainable developments, developments that are environmentally friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing should be remembered in this debate, and that is the absolutely chronically sad thing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) said today. He said that all he has to consider is the environmental issues. I would have thought that any minister in any government not only would be concerned about particular issues in their portfolio but also would introduce that most important of dynamics, the human element&mdash;that is, what the human effect would be of a certain decision. But the minister says, `No, I see it in only environmental terms.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister sees the administration of his portfolio only in environmental terms, clearly he is not fit for the job. He ought to resign. The task of the minister is to also take into account the human dynamic, and the human dynamic has not been considered by the minister for the environment; it has not been considered by the green movement in this absolute charade in this forestry debate; nor has it been considered by those who are peddling the draining of Lake Pedder. If the Greens, the Democrats and this minister for the environment want any credibility, they will have to start talking about linking in the human dynamic with the environmental dynamic. They ought to get the two together, get the proper balance, and then they will achieve credibility and respect. I am sure that Australia will then be a lot better placed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not normally speak on the adjournment, but this evening I am going to take a few minutes of the Senate's time. Today something happened that I never thought I would see in this place. Finally, something that I have been looking for for seven years has come about. During question time today, Senator Evans, in answering the first question, admitted that drought knocks around the economy of Australia. Over seven years I listened to Senator Button, when he was Leader of the Government in the Senate, blame the Fraser government every day for what he thought was the excessive foreign debt that was left when the Fraser government went out of government in 1983. That debt stood at $23.383 billion. Senator Bolkus can pretend to sleep as much as he likes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Too late, Senator Bolkus. You interjected and I have picked you up on it. Over those years, every time there was an economic question, Senator Button would finish up or start by blaming the Fraser government for the deficit of $23.383 billion. Time and again I would yell at him, `What about the eastern states drought?', but he would always turn a deaf ear to my interjections and not once did he take any notice of them. And so it went on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans, when he could not handle answering the economic question from Senator Hill today, called out, `And don't forget we have had a drought.' I certainly did not expect that to come, but it came all of a sudden today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) had to say on 31 August 1994 regarding the effects of the drought. Amongst other things, the journalist asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you still feel that there is no need to take special allowance in forecasting for the effects of the drought?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Willis answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously the drought now is clearly of more serious dimensions than it appeared it would have been at the time we made the budget forecast. So that certainly is a change. On the other hand, it is also true that the world economy has picked up. At least the prospects for growth in the world economy have picked up quite markedly from where they were just seven months ago, so those are offsetting factors in terms of growth forecasts and there is nothing in this and nothing that is happening currently that would want to make us change our budget forecasts in terms of the overall growth of 4 1/2 percent in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist further asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is there danger, Treasurer, that with the drought taking grip that we will be exporting too less, to pay not enough to pay for our imports. So they are coming in under investment.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Willis replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously there is going to be an impact on exports there. Of course, some of that was factored in anyway in the budget forecast&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have just said, it is more serious now. On the other hand, the pick up in the world economy will give us better prices, better volumes perhaps and, therefore, recover some of that ground maybe. We do not know how that is going to pan out, but there is nothing that would lead one at this stage to make any changes in that forecast.</PARA>
<PARA>That was from a press release of 31 August 1994. The drought had already taken grip of eastern Australia; the writing was certainly on the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government having not recognised that the last budget of the Fraser government was interfered with by the drought, let me read you a few figures. The net foreign debt in 1982-83, as I have already quoted, was $23.383 billion. In 1992-93, under the Labor government, it had grown to $168.787 billion. In 1993-94, it had gone down to $162.727 billion. Looking at the quarterly figures, in September 1993 the figure stood at $172.9 billion; in June of that year, it stood at $162.727 billion; and in September of 1994-95&mdash;the latest figures available&mdash;it stood at $160.258 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans also claimed today&mdash;and I have not seen the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that the net foreign debt was reduced recently by $22 billion. I think he quoted that figure. These figures show that 12 months ago, if you take the last figure of September 1994, it has been reduced by only $12 billion. He did not claim that the government was responsible for that reduction. He led us to believe, or read into his answer, that the government did take responsibility for that. I know exactly how that $12 billion was reduced: by the appreciation of the Australian dollar&mdash;and, I am afraid, by nothing else. I would like Senator Evans tomorrow to explain better how that $22 billion was reduced&mdash;if I have got him right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now at the situation where we will have a budget deficit of $28 billion. Of course, the government has said&mdash;or Senator Evans did, anyhow; whether he reflects the government's views in this place or not, I do not know&mdash;and after all Senator Bolkus said he would prefer Senator Button back in here&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you call out loud enough, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> may pick up your interjection. That was an interesting interjection. Senator Evans has finally admitted that the drought can affect the economy. That is something that we farmers know every day, but I did not think I would ever see the day that Senator Evans would admit it. You must admit, Mr President, that the drought does affect Australia and affects it very badly. Now that Senator Evans has claimed that that is what knocked the budget around for the government this year and caused the deficit to blow out the $28 billion, he can finally get around to admitting that the disastrous 1982 drought of the eastern states, unfortunately followed by a drought in the west in 1983, certainly knocked the last Fraser budget around. Perhaps even this government will admit to Mr Fraser leaving things in a better situation, as I have always claimed he had.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) This issue has been monitored for the last five years by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers with responsibility for censorship. While there has been community concern about the easy accessibility of sexually explicit and violent lyrics to children, the overall level of complaint to Ministers has been small. The States and Territories have reported only a handful of complaints, while representations to the Minister (18) and the Office of Film and Literature Classification (10) in the last six months are also small.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The possibility of a classification system for recorded audio music was once again considered by Ministers at their 3 November 1994 meeting. It was agreed that the number of complaints continued to be relatively small and that the matter should remain under review.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify from personnel databases the number of families separated by Service postings, and the reason for separation. Such statistics could only be obtained by conducting a survey, or census, of all military units. However, based upon information gained as part of the ADF Families Mobility and Dislocation Study, a survey of 1200 ADF members taken in March 1993 revealed that 7.8 percent of ADF parents were separated from their families for Service reasons. Of that number 49.1 percent (3.8 percent of all ADF parents) were currently on an unaccompanied posting, that is a posting of 12 months or longer. Altogether, during the entire course of their careers, 6.3 percent of the surveyed members reported having had at least one unaccompanied posting with one half of 1 percent having reported three or more. On average the surveyed members reported 1.12 separations per year of four weeks or longer in duration and, on average, two and a half months per year of Service-related separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is not possible to accurately provide the answer to this question for the reason stated previously. However, as a guide, during Financial Year 1993/94 the Navy averaged 2206 members in receipt of separation allowance each payday, Army has advised that on a randomly selected pay day, 452 Army members were in receipt of separation allowance and the Air Force has indicated that approximately 170 members are in receipt of separation allowance at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) are posted to meet specific Service requirements. Those requirements can be generated by establishment changes, role and task changes, vacancies caused for a variety of reasons, changes in personnel circumstances, invalidity or death of members. Essentially, the posting process is one by which the Services allocate personnel to fulfil their assigned functions, roles and tasks. Overall guidance for the posting of members to vacancies is provided by the Chief of Defence Force's Policy Directive Number 19. The essential elements of that Directive (subject to Service exigencies) are that members are to receive six months notice of posting, three years in a post and where possible, six years in location. There are three prime considerations for the posting of personnel. Firstly, there is the Service requirement to allocate appropriately qualified members, in terms of rank, qualifications and motivation, to vacancies. Secondly, the development of members' careers to ensure their satisfactory progression to meet the future requirements of the Service. Thirdly, the reconciliation of Service requirements and career development with a member's personal aspirations and circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) With regard to the posting of members to facilitate a spouse's employment requirements, the Services endeavour to collocate spouses provided a vacancy exists in the area required and no other Service member will be disadvantaged. However, Service requirements will take priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The entitlements of ADF married members who proceed on posting within Australia without their families are dependant on the length of posting and whether the member is categorised `married separated'. All members, irrespective of rank, are entitled to reunion travel every three months, and may receive subsidised housing in the location where the family resides. Members categorised `married separated' attract additional benefits: separation allowance and a waiver of rations and quarters charges. Furthermore, members posted for a period of at least six months are entitled to a limited removal which covers personal effects and a motor vehicle. In the Public Sector, for an unaccompanied Australian Public Service officer proceeding on temporary transfer, in addition to the normal entitlements and in recognition that the officer is required to maintain a second household, the officer's contribution towards rental or boarding accommodation is waived and meal allowances are paid. Non-Senior Executive Service officers are entitled to a reunion visit every three months with Senior Executive Service officers being entitled to a reunion visit every month (but certain conditions apply).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the prospectus for the NRMA float states that NRMA Holdings Ltd was admitted as a member of NRMA Ltd on 4 August 1994 and as a member of NRMA Insurance Ltd on 16 August 1994, by a resolution of the boards of each of those companies.</PARA>

Mr Bateman is a partner with the Sydney law firm of Abbot Tout which is solicitor to NRMA Holdings Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The question whether NRMA Holdings Ltd is to be properly characterised as a subsidiary ultimately rests upon the existence of various facts, particularly the matters dealt with in section 46 and 47 of the Corporations Law relating to the existence of actual `control' of the board of directors and the shares in NRMA Holdings Ltd. The mere existence of certain common directors between one company and another does not, of itself, necessarily imply control by the one over the other. Given that aspects of the NRMA float are currently before the Federal Court, it would not be appropriate for the Government to offer legal advice on the detailed legal and administrative arrangements for the NRMA demutualisation process. The honourable Senator's question has been drawn to the attention of the Australian Securities Commission which is continuing to monitor aspects of the NRMA float, and is assisting the Court in its deliberations. I would, therefore, expect that if any matters requiring further action  come to the attention of the ASC, then that action will be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As to whether NRMA Holdings is a subsidiary of NRMA Ltd, see the answer to question (2) above.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As to whether NRMA Holdings is a subsidiary of NRMA Ltd, see the answer to question (2) above. Generally, in regard to ownership by a company of its own shares I note that the Simplification Task Force established by the Attorney-General to review the Corporations Law has recently released for public comment a proposal to amend the share capital rules of that Law. One of the proposals involves replacing the present self ownership rules in section 185 with provisions that depend for their operation on actual control over the votes attaching to company shares. Specifically, the proposal would not permit an entity that is controlled by a company to acquire a `relevant interest', as defined under the Law, in a share in the controlling company. In addition, the proposal would require a company that acquired control of an entity that has a relevant interest in a share in that company to either end its control of the controlled entity within 12 months, or, within that same period, to cause the controlled entity to dispose of its relevant interest in a share in the controlling company. It is further proposed that during the period in which the self ownership exists the voting rights attaching to the shares in the controlling company will not be able to be exercised. The Task Force is seeking comments on these proposals from interested parties by 17 February 1995.</PARA>

I am advised by the ASC that it has expressed no views either for or against demutualisation. The Corporations Law (the Law) does not provide a role for the ASC in supporting or failing to support any particular corporate activity as described in a prospectus. The prospectus for NRMA Holdings Limited (Holdings) specifically states, as required by paragraph 1021(14)(c) of the Law, that the ASC takes no responsibility as to the contents of the prospectus.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that Ms Ralph has indicated that the comments attributed to her were not made in reference to the Court's judgment at all, but rather to whether the judgment had any substantial impact on the board's original decision that de-mutualisation is in the best interests of the members and the NRMA. In that respect I understand that Ms Ralph did assert her belief that the finding did not alter her support for the de-mutualisation of the Association. She does recall having used the word `technical'. This was not, however, in reference to the specific findings of the Court.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) I am advised that on 13 October 1994 Mr Justice Gummow handed down his decision and made a number of orders. On 14 October 1994 the orders were amended, in part to deal with the proxy votes that had been cast. The amended orders provided that both NRMA Limited (the Association) and NRMA Insurance Limited (Insurance) were restrained without leave of the Court from proceeding with any business at the respective meetings of members to be held on 19 October 1994 and from relying upon any of the proxies obtained or given in respect of that meeting, other than by taking such steps as were necessary or appropriate to adjourn the respective meetings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) I am advised that a copy of the opinion of Messrs Garnsey QC and Camilleri, Counsel for Mr Talbot and Ms Fraser, was first provided to the ASC on 22 September 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised that the matters raised in that opinion were the subject of oral advice only, which was to the effect that grounds had not been made out to support regulatory action by the ASC. Accordingly, there are no copies of advisings to be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11)(a) I am advised that the ASC did receive and consider the said representations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am also advised that the prospectus was registered on 23 August 1994. Prior to that date, senior executives of the NRMA and their solicitors sought discussions with, and provided background information to, officers of the ASC Regional Office in New South Wales. Formal applications for relief from various provisions of the Law were subsequently made by solicitors advising the issuers. The substantive effect of those applications was to permit the announcement of, and debate about, restructuring prior to registration of the prospectus. Relief was also sought to enable voting, election and application forms to be sent to persons at various stages of the restructuring which were not physically attached to the registered prospectus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) As required by the Law, the ASC considered the applications.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) I am advised that the ASC has independently considered and assessed every complaint received from members of the Association and Insurance and from any director of either company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) I am advised that the ASC did not consider the proposed de-mutualisation process in detail for the reason that there appeared to be no issue about its legality. Accordingly there are no legal advisings to or by the ASC on this matter. In relation to the prospectus, the ASC has acted only to register that document. It did so because it had not formed the view that there was anything in the prospectus that was false, misleading or omitted. Accordingly there are also no legal advisings to or by the ASC on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The decision of Mr Justice Gummow is an interlocutory decision and I am advised that the Federal Court heard an application for leave to appeal against that decision on 6 December 1994 and that leave to appeal is reserved.

However, as noted at (14), in relation to this particular matter, the doctrine of sub judice dictates that it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on the correctness of the decision or the interpretation of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) If Governments are going to be in a position to appoint appropriately qualified people to serve on its regulatory bodies, they need to be able to attract people with the right kind of experience. In the case of the corporate regulator, the ASC, that includes business people who are able to bring the hard edge of business experience to their role within the Commission. For this reason there are also advantages in such appointees continuing with their business role in some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed that was clearly foreseen by the Parliament in enacting the disclosure provisions of Part 7 the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the conflict of interest provisions of the Act that governed the activities of the predecessor of the ASC, namely the National Companies and Securities Commission Act, enacted by the Fraser Liberal Government in 1979, expressly contemplates that members of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) will continue to be directors of bodies corporate, notwithstanding their appointment to the NCSC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC is not the only current regulatory body, the members of which may retain their positions as directors of bodies corporate. As to State and Territory regulatory bodies, section 110 of the Independent Commission against Corruption Act 1988 of New South Wales, for example, expressly makes provision for officers of the Commission to continue to hold positions in corporations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus the ASC is not alone in the approach taken to the continued involvement of its members in the business community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. I am advised that if the resolution were supported by 75 per cent of the members present and voting, members could retain corporate membership through shares in NRMA Holdings Limited (Holdings) if they chose to do so. Holdings would have controlled all the assets of NRMA Limited (the Association) and NRMA Insurance Limited (Insurance).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Chapter 6 of the Corporations Law is the part of the current legislation that is often referred to as the `takeovers code'. Under the provisions of Chapter 6, a person who has served a Part A statement or who has caused a take-over announcement to be made can be required to purchase shares in the same class of shares subject to the takeover once the number of shares to which that person becomes entitled represents not less than 90% of the shares included in the class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compulsory acquisition provisions of Chapter 6 are triggered by the offeror's entitlement to shares reaching the requisite percentage, and not by a percentage vote of the shareholders of the target company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The Corporations Law provides for various mechanisms by which a change of control of a company may be effected. Chapter 6 is one such regime. Chapter 6, however, only governs the change of control of a company where the change is effected by way of acquisition of shares in that company. The proposed structure of the NRMA restructuring was not a `takeover' to which the provisions of Chapter 6 could apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts have recognised that other legislative measures including merger or amalgamation by scheme of arrangement, selective capital reductions and change to the constituent documents (being the memorandum and articles of association) of a company, may be alternative means of effecting a change of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in relation to each of these measures, a member has a statutory right to apply for relief under section 260 of the Corporations Law where the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a member or members, or contrary to the interests of the members as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. As stated above, there are various means whereby change of control of a company may occur, each of which serve different purposes. Members of companies who feel aggrieved about a particular circumstance have remedies available to them to seek relief.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) The Commonwealth does not require the States to account for the expenditure of their own recurrent funding of literacy programs. Literacy is one of the Commonwealth's priorities for schooling and is supported through $3 billion in expenditure annually on Commonwealth schools programs. States, Territories and non-government school authorities provide educational accountability for most of these programs through the Annual National Report on Schooling. Literacy outcomes are included in State chapters of this Report. The Commonwealth does not require States to provide dollar amounts for expenditure on literacy as this would require estimation of expenditure of teacher salaries, support structures and curriculum materials in individual schools. Financial acquittals of these grants are required by 30 June of the year following the program year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Reliable, nationally consistent data on the levels on English literacy attainment among school students are not currently available. However, in the White Paper on Employment, `Working Nation', the Commonwealth allocated approximately $2.6 million, to collect by the end of 1996, data at three significant stages of schooling. The aims of the National School Literacy Survey are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to obtain a clear view regarding English literacy levels among Australian school students, identifying those student characteristics associated with different levels of literacy;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Information presently available does not enable definitive conclusions to be drawn on this issue. There is inconsistency between studies as the varying outcomes reflect differences in test construction.

The Commonwealth supports the development of strategies to help children with literacy problems in the early years of schooling (K-3) through the Literacy and Learning National Component and the new Early Literacy Component of the National Equity Program for Schools (NEPS).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Government is investigating this issue through a report by Dr Peter Hill `Review of Resource Levels for Government Primary Schools'. This report indicated that in terms of educational need, there may be a stronger rationale for differential funding rates for students at different stages of schooling than the two rates (one for primary and the other for secondary) that apply to the Commonwealth's General Recurrent Grants Program. The report is currently with the Schools Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training for public consultation and a report to the Government on options.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Higher education institutions are self-governing organisations and have responsibility for their own internal management, including the design, content and accreditation of courses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) My Department does not have any data on whether 9 and/or 12 year old children are unable to read Koori place names because of a lack of phonic skills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) I am advised that the Family Services Program, administered by Legal Aid and Family Services (LAFS) in the Attorney-General's Department, funds Marriage/Relationship Counselling, Marriage/Relationship Education, Family Mediation, Adolescent Mediation and Family Therapy, and Family Skills Training Programs. Organisations are funded on a recurrent basis, subject to compliance with a service agreement and program guidelines. In 1993/94 $20,457,688 was provided to approved organisations on a recurrent basis to provide these services.

Because there was no additional budget allocation for the Family Services Program in 1993/94, these grants were limited. Only $3,450 was available for commitment recurrently. This amount was granted to Relationships Australia Qld following a request for additional funding, and is listed as part of that organisation`s recurrent funding at Attachment 1.

Agencies are requested to provide submissions for funding to the Attorney-General's Department, taking into account criteria in the relevant program guidelines. Submissions include a detailed outline of the anticipated amount required to run the program(s).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no additional budget allocation for the Family Services Program in 1993/94, therefore funds available were limited. When assessing applications for recurrent funding, consideration was given to ratings from needs-based planning models mentioned above, and the viability and practice standards of existing services. Given the limited amount available, it was not possible to fund new services. Requests for one-off funding were assessed on the basis of knowledge of infrastructure needs, ascertained first-hand by members of the monitoring team of LAFS from frequent visits to the agencies. Priority was given to requests that would materially assist in delivering higher quality services.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Australian Heritage Commission has assessed Ascot Chambers as being of cultural significance for: demonstrating the course and pattern of history as the first Brisbane building to use steel-framed high rise construction, and for marking the beginning of the new generation of high-rise buildings in Queensland; for its technical innovation in accessing a tall building by Otis Electric lifts; and as a notable work of Queensland architects Hall &amp; Prentice.</PARA>
