It was agreed that I would get the business Abetz Curtis and Docking&mdash;Kingston; namely, the Kingston firm. It was agreed and I immediately thereafter set about to sell the firm Abetz Curtis and Docking&mdash;Kingston, of which I was the sole proprietor.

<PARA>This is a motion to which at least Senator Harradine and perhaps some other senators may wish to speak, so it might be appropriate if I speak to it at this point. The reason for this being proposed is that senators would be aware that the issue of the cut-off motion has been one of concern now for some period of time. As Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I have been concerned about what I genuinely believe are some unintended consequences with the existing order of the Senate in relation to the cut-off issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave notice of a motion earlier this day with a preferred set of words from a government perspective. I proposed that particular notice of motion on the basis that, of course, the government has an amendment&mdash;that is, an amendment to a Senate order&mdash;and we have a situation where clearly the bill we have just dealt with, the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill, which the government wants to debate today, was introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 December last year. Therefore, it has been publicly available for consultation and scrutiny of all senators and, more broadly, in the community since that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because that legislation was passed in the House of Representatives this sitting, the existing cut-off motion, the current order of the Senate, prevents debate on that bill in this sitting. So that obviously produces a situation where a bill introduced into the parliament in December of last year could not effectively be passed at the earliest until May 1994 without an exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice of motion I gave earlier today seeks to give full effect to the principle of introducing in one sittings and debating in the next. That was an objective spelt out, I believe, by Senator Gareth Evans on 18 August 1993 in the statement he made to the Senate about accountability and Senate legislative processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is proper to allow senators to give consideration, at least for a short period over the next 24 hours, to the notice of motion I have given today as well as the existing amendment which appears already on the red. I suggest that adjourning government business notice of motion No. 2 is the appropriate way to deal with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made very clear its position on 18 August 1993. Senator Evans, in what I think was a very important and clear contribution at that time, spoke about a reasonable concern of the Senate `to want commitments about the early access of all honourable senators to legislation and to the documentation that goes with that legislation to enable a reasonable time to prepare a response to it'. That is a principle that the government has accepted and has committed itself to work to achieving. We have always made clear to the Senate&mdash;and to a greater or lesser extent in the Senate I think senators have understood&mdash;that there are certain urgent and budget related bills that ought not properly for the good government of the nation be caught up in this particular cut-off procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans made clear in that contribution to the Senate in 1993 what the government was committing itself to doing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are prepared to do is address very directly the two basic issues . . . One is the dates on which bills are introduced and become available on the public record&mdash;the date on which we have access to the text and the supporting documentation. The second thing we are prepared to do is address the question of scheduling of the actual debates&mdash;the way in which those bills, whenever introduced, are actually dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the introduction of bills, I am prepared on behalf of the government to undertake to introduce in either the House of Representatives or the Senate at least half the bills that are proposed for passage this session by 21 October.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further undertake to ensure that the remainder of the bills that are proposed for passage this session be introduced, either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, by 18 November this year.</PARA>
<PARA>He talked then about some of the more general principles involved and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided in principle that in future we will introduce legislation&mdash;to the extent it proves possible; I have to add that qualification&mdash;on the basis of introduction in one sittings for debate in the next. I guess that that is the optimal position for everyone in this chamber. It will give everyone the opportunity in the parliamentary break to fully consider their position and take such advice as they want, research it, produce sensible responses and deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA>He also went on in terms of the commitments that he made at that time to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it would probably take two or more sittings to fully implement a system based on, so far as possible, introducing legislation one sitting and debating it the next. All I can say is that steps are now being taken to make a significant start on it in these sittings; in other words, to try to work out, right now, what the legislative program will be for the first sittings next year and a way in which a significant number of the bills for passage next sittings&mdash;the autumn sittings next year&mdash;can be at least introduced and put on the table by the time we get up in December. I am not sure how big a start it is possible to make on that, but we are trying hard to do it.</PARA>
<PARA>Try hard we have since that period, with I think a considerable degree of success. There are unintended consequences in relation to the amount of legislation that has been caught up in the House of Representatives, with the situation that unless a bill has been introduced into the Senate in one particular session it cannot be debated until the subsequent session. That is the current situation. That was not intended at the time. I believe there is an acceptance from all senators that that situation ought to be addressed and the standing orders of the Senate changed. </PARA>

The intention of the government has always been to see a bill introduced into parliament in one session for passage in the next. My reason for seeking a deferral until the next day of sitting for this particular matter is to ensure that further discussions can take place amongst senators and parties to see if agreement can be reached on this issue. I think that is a sensible approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take too much time of the Senate. There is a notice of motion that senators can give consideration to. That notice of motion stands in my name and was given this morning. I ask senators to look carefully at these commitments that have been made by the government on the issue of introduction of legislation in one session for passage the next. I believe the notice of motion that I have given does address that commitment and does address this issue in a way that will best serve the interests of all senators to ensure that there is transparency and there is an opportunity for senators and members of the general community to have the maximum opportunity to examine legislation, develop their views on it and receive input from other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I believe it is appropriate that we do defer this matter for a short period of time so we can further address the options informally and so the Senate can make a final determination on this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On that point, I think the standing orders are a little vague as to whether or not a senator can debate a postponement motion. Of course, when a motion to adjourn the debate is put, there is no debate permitted on that motion. Under standing order 201(3) it makes it perfectly clear when it states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>A motion to adjourn the debate is not open to debate or amendment. Clearly, if we have a motion to postpone a matter to a particular day, for example 5 May 1995, then surely that must be open to debate because it is a motion to postpone not a motion to adjourn in the strict sense of standing order 201.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make it perfectly clear, apropos of what I said about Senator Faulkner, that it sounded very reasonable. The government is not reasonable about these issues. The government is very irrational about these issues. Look at how it is dealing with legislation at this point in time. We have a piece of legislation that was introduced into the House of Representatives and came into this chamber this session&mdash;the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. That bill goes to the very heart of the government's responsibilities on protecting the human rights of persons who are likely to be forced back to China to face coerced abortions or sterilisations. That is what that bill does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bill came before this chamber and was referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Even the majority of the committee was less than enthusiastic about it. There were dissenting reports by the opposition, the Democrats and me. I know the Greens are opposed to it as well. What does the government do? Instead of bringing that particular bill on for debate or seeking to exempt it from the cut-off point&mdash;and it would not have got that&mdash;it introduced the legislation in even worse form in the House of Representatives late last night, expecting it to be debated today. Why has the government done that? Because it wants to have a trigger for a double dissolution. That is the only reason why it wants to do it. That is precisely the only reason that it wants to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is playing fast and loose. It is using grubby political tactics and using those who are likely to suffer the cruellest of human rights violations as a political football. The government is cynical, callous and corrupt. Any government that would do that is corrupt. I must say that any government which would play off the human rights of persons for a grubby political purpose is corrupt. I have never said that about a government before in all my 20 years in this place, but I say it now.

Why were we not given that chance? The reason we were not given that chance is that, had we amended that legislation to provide that sort of protection and had it gone back to the House of Representatives and the government used its numbers there, it would not have been a double dissolution trigger. As we all know under the constitution, for a double dissolution trigger the bill must be introduced into the House of Representatives.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This does not mean that people are not suffering significantly from aircraft noise. They are. And that's why on 8 December 1994 the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport announced a number of measures to minimise the number of people affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has committed a further $120 million for the building of a 2900 metre runway which will be capable of accommodating medium haul B747 operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have commenced an EIS on road link construction at an approximate cost of $200 million to coincide with the opening of the 2900 metre runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also started a joint Commonwealth/State engineering study to secure a rail corridor as a basis for effective rail links between Sydney West, Kingsford Smith Airport and the city.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that we have clarified which report is before the Senate, I seek to address some remarks about the supplementary estimates meeting in relation to the electorate office of Senator Michael Baume. Senator Baume has been dealt with in a peculiar and vindictive manner in relation to the way the department has approached his entitlements as a senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report dealing with Senator Michael Baume's electorate office has been signed by a number of coalition senators who very much feel that Senator Baume is quite right to feel aggrieved at the way he has been treated. I want to discuss the National Media Liaison Service and the way it engages in political behaviour in this country. The new electorate office given to Senator Michael Baume in the Commonwealth parliamentary offices requires every visitor to that office to walk past the office of the National Media Liaison Service. The service can monitor each and every single person that comes into his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make no mistake: Senator Baume has been the brave senator who has fought and exposed the way the companies of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have dealt with pigs and the way that they have underpaid people and not put in returns. Senator Baume has been picked out for particular attention, with vitriolic responses by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) on many occasions because of his pursuit of truth. Now, when he wants to change his electorate office&mdash;after the lease on his current electorate office expired and he wanted to move&mdash;he is denied that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that, if you are a Labor senator, like Senator Stephen Loosley, you can spend $34,000 moving out of the Commonwealth parliamentary offices into the central business district; you can get yourself some exposure and be dealt with favourably. But Senator Michael Baume is forced to move in. Why the different treatment between Senator Stephen Loosely and Senator Michael Baume? The only obvious reason is that Senator Stephen Loosley is part of the Labor Right that runs this Labor government and will always look after its mates, and Senator Michael Baume has made a name for himself in exposing some of the dubious practices of the Labor Right in his home state of New South Wales. There is no other explanation. It is so convenient to make every visitor to Senator Baume's office walk past the National Media Liaison Service office. You can say that we are paranoid&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right. I stand corrected by Senator Sherry. I should not have said `electorate'; I should have said `community'. The point is made that it is quite appropriate for a senator to seek a space for his electorate office within the community that he identifies with, that he feels part of and where there is local knowledge of that member within that area. That is what Senator Baume has sought to do. There is nothing strange about that, but the government wants to place him up in the Commonwealth parliamentary offices where its members want to move out&mdash;people like Senator Loosley.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Baume has exposed all of this to the parliament and to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For his hard work, for his efforts in pursuing the truth, you as a government are now victimising him&mdash;and deliberately victimising him&mdash;to ensure that he does not have the sort of exposure he might otherwise enjoy as an entitlement of a senator in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Sherry to seek to defend the government on this does really reflect very poorly, and indeed very sadly, on Senator Sherry.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minority Report by Coalition Members and Participating Members on the Department of Administrative Services Additional Estimates Involving Senator Baume's Electorate Office Relocation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure by the Executive Government in these hearings to recognise the rights and duties of Senators examining the Estimates, should not be allowed to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grossly unsatisfactory, misleading, incorrect and non-answers from the Department of Administrative Services have compounded the serious problem of Ministerial denial of the rights of a Senator who has moved his principal place of residence, similarly to relocate his electorate office (on the expiration of its lease) into the same area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions at the hearing related to the rejection by the Minister, the Honourable Frank Walker, of his Department's repeated recommendations that Senator Baume's electorate office be relocated from Wollongong to Narellan NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister denied a request to provide the Committee with a copy of a departmental minute to the Minister dated 8 November, 1994, requesting his permission to seek suitable office accommodation for Senator Baume in Narellan, which he had rejected; a question asking for reasons for the Minister's reversal of his earlier decision to refuse Senator Loosley's relocation out of the Sydney Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices into another CBD location with an annual rental cost of $34,000 (a relocation the Department has reported as partly due to "accommodation pressures in the CPO" while the Minister was forcibly relocating Senator Baume into the CPO offices) received the response that it was none of Senator Baume's business; officials made repeated errors of fact in their responses, for many of which they subsequently apologised saying they had not intended to mislead, and failed to answer direct questions, several of which they took on notice despite previous advice to the department that this matter would be raised in detail. No answers to these questions on notice have yet been provided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I incorporated that report is to dramatise just a few points. Apart from anything else, there were simply grossly unsatisfactory, misleading, incorrect and non-answers from the Department of Administrative Services. I believe that was under instructions from the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who has behaved totally improperly in this matter from the very beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has provided no justification whatsoever for wasting something like $100,000 of taxpayers' money by refusing permission for me to have an electorate office in a cheap rental area in Narellan outside the Sydney metropolitan area and instead forcing me into the high rent central business district of Sydney. To make way for me&mdash;the department keeps on denying this&mdash;in the Commonwealth parliamentary office in Sydney, the minister ultimately agreed to move Senator Loosley, who was initially denied permission to move out of those offices, to an area which will cost the taxpayer $34,000 in rent per year against the rent of around $15,000 that would have been paid for my office in Narellan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley has been allowed to move out, and the reason for the subsequent action of the minister withdrawing his objection to Senator Loosley's move is, according to the department, `accommodation pressures in the Sydney CPO'. That is why Senator Loosley was allowed to leave, but of course there was plenty of room at the inn when Senator Baume was required to move there as some kind of Christmas present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This kind of dishonesty is just unacceptable. Let me explain to Senator Sherry how Labor members in Tasmania are discriminated for by this government. For his colleague Senator Murphy, a Labor Tasmanian, to establish an office in Launceston, the rent is $36,000 a year and the fit-out cost is $70,000&mdash;more than double the rent that I could have had for an office in Narellan and certainly far more than any fit-out cost. This is evident active discrimination by the government in Tasmania, but there is a whole schedule of them here. It is incredible. Mary Crawford in Queensland costs taxpayers $43,000 a year rent and $62,000 in fit-out costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the only person, according to the department, who has been dealt with in this way. A letter from the department says that it is unprecedented that a senator should not be allowed to have an electorate office in proximity to his principal place of residence. It is incredible that this minister, for one shameful political reason, decided that I should not be allowed to have my office there. And the political reason is that his factional mate the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) is on a two per cent margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am flattered that the Minister for Administrative Services takes the view that my having an electorate office in the marginal Labor seat of Macarthur would so damage his factional mate that he would lose his seat. I must say I agree with him. I think I am an effective senator and it would probably damage the poorly performing, incompetent member for Macarthur whose only qualification for protection is that he is a member of the minister's faction and so has to be looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think my presence there may well damage his ability to be re-elected because I notice that my Wollongong office was being inundated with requests from the electors of Macarthur to look after them because their local member was so hopeless. It is helped by the fact that I used to be the member for Macarthur when it was well represented in the House of Representatives. So there are no doubt many reasons why people would prefer to ask me as a member of parliament to look after their problems than the present incompetent member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact remains that his department recommended to this minister on several occasions, in accordance with precedent, that I should be allowed to move into the Narellan area. The location that I had found was right opposite the site of the proposed council chambers for that rapidly expanding region. In other words, it was a magnificent opportunity to get an ideal location at a very low rent, because all those developments had not yet taken place. It would have been an ideal location for an electorate office&mdash;either for a senator or for the member of the House of Representatives who was elected for that region. I would have hoped that after the next election it may have been appropriate for the House of Representatives member&mdash;who, naturally, will be a member of the Liberal Party&mdash;to convince me that it was a better location for him than for me. Whatever the situation, it was unprecedented, according to the department, that the minister rejected this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is improper for any minister, where he has the right or discretion to grant requests like this, not to grant them, recklessly&mdash;in other words, to refuse his permission on any grounds other than sound, sensible, rational grounds. It is illegal, in fact. That means I would have to take this dishonourable minister to the Federal Court in order to pursue it because it does not come under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I would have to spend a very large amount of money to demonstrate the illegality of this minister's behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know it is improper but it also happens to be illegal. While it is true that you must have the minister's approval to move your electorate office&mdash;even when your lease has expired and you are being thrown out, you still need the minister's approval&mdash;this minister refused that approval as recommended by his department in an unprecedented way, without giving any justification as to the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen the overwhelming cost of Labor relocations. Yet we had the departmental officials, as we have seen in this report, obfuscating, and the minister telling the committee and me that we had no right to inquire as to the details of why $34,000 was being wasted in order to give Senator Loosley the opportunity to move out&mdash;as they said, to ease the accommodation pressures so that I could move in. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a matter of serious principle here. No minister of the House of Representatives can tell the Senate that it is not its business to inquire into the expenditure of public money. That is what this minister has done.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends ten bills administered within the Transport portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a fine tuning and clarification of provisions of various acts within the portfolio. The amendments do not introduce substantial new policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not propose to deal with the minor technical amendments in this speech, but instead will concentrate upon the more significant amendments contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of amendments to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 and the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 which implement some revised accountability arrangements applying to Commonwealth Authorities and Government Business Enterprises. They provide for Ministerial notices about the strategic direction of the enterprises, the supply of information to Ministers and ministerial nominees, the payment of interim dividends, the appointment of Chief Executive Officers and Acting Chief Executive Officers by Boards and, in the case of the Australian National Railways Commission, the setting of financial targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority are currently employed under the Public Service Act 1922. The Government considers that this arrangement is not compatible with the proposed accountability standards. Accordingly, employment of staff of the Authority will be removed from the ambit of the Public Service Act 1922. Staff of the Authority will now be appointed and employed under conditions determined by the Authority. It should be noted however that a person employed by the Authority before the commencement of this amendment shall be taken, immediately after the commencement, to be employed under the same terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By amendment of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the bill increases to the equivalent of $500,000 the liability limits in respect of passenger death or injury for Australian international carriers. These amendments compliment regulations made in October 1994 under that act which increased to $500,000 the passenger liability limit for domestic carriers and foreign carriers whose States of registry are not parties to the Warsaw Convention. Australia cannot, consistent with its international obligations under the Warsaw Convention, impose higher liability limits in respect of foreign international carriers whose States of registry are parties to that Convention. However I consider it important that all passengers carried to and from Australia are provided with the same level of protection. Accordingly, the Department of Transport will approach the relevant foreign carriers requesting them to increase their limits to the same level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 currently provides for the fitting of a compliance plate to indicate that a vehicle meets national standards. The administration of this scheme is being made more flexible by introducing "identification plates" which will indicate a vehicle's status in relation to compliance with the national standards. The range of identification plates will include the existing compliance plates and allow for the determination of different types of plate, how they are to be fitted and, in some cases, allow for the imposition of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes a number of amendments to the Navigation Act 1912.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, that act is being amended to prevent a seafarer from claiming compensation for injury under both the act and the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992, thereby preventing possible double dipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, Part IV of the Navigation Act is being amended to enable Australia to adopt a resolution of the International Maritime Organisation that will permit the early implementation of a system of ship survey and certification that is harmonised between the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, the International Convention on Load Lines 1966 and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973. The harmonised system will standardise the duration of certificates issued under the three Conventions. The costs of these requirements to shipowners will be reduced as it will be possible to program several surveys at the same time and there is greater flexibility in the times at which surveys can be arranged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the act is amended to incorporate the terms and principles adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in its International Convention on Salvage 1989. The Convention provides greater incentives for effective and timely salvage operations and to assist with the protection of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, the bill amends offence provisions in the act relating to the abuse of alcohol and other drugs by seafarers. In view of the Government's responsibility to ensure the safety of life at sea and to protect the marine environment it is considered necessary to provide an objective standard of impairment by alcohol and drugs, and to prescribe forms of tests similar to those in other transport modes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maritime industry has been consulted and generally supports the introduction of standards and prescribed methods of testing of impairment due to alcohol or other drugs. The industry for its part will introduce and promote policies and practices to control and regulate the use of alcohol and drugs by persons employed in ships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Government has taken the opportunity in amending the Navigation Act to remove a large number of outdated and sexist references in that act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 will enable Australia to accede to the 1992 Protocol amending the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been a party to the parent treaty, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (Civil Liability Convention), since 1984. The primary objective of the Civil Liability Convention is to create a system of compulsory oil pollution liability insurance for the owners of oil tankers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 Protocol was developed to overcome the effects of inflation on the real values of the limits of liability. For vessels of less than 5,000 gross tons the protocol envisages liability of three million special drawing rights, as defined by the International Monetary Fund. This is equivalent to approximately $A5.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For larger vessels, liability is calculated on the basis of the vessels tonnage, with an overall maximum for the ship's liability of 59.7 million special drawing rights of the International Monetary fund, or $A114.5 million. These levels ensure that the damage that such a ship can cause will be more effectively compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation available under Civil Liability Convention is supplemented by a separate convention, known as the Fund Convention, which will shortly enter into force for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments effected by the 1992 Civil Liability Convention Protocol include extension of the geographic scope of the convention to cover incidents occurring in the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will afford additional protection to sensitive areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and safeguard existing and potential fisheries in the Australian fishing zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of the legislation will also be extended as tankers in ballast and combination carriers are now included in the coverage of the Civil Liability Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 Protocol replaces an earlier 1984 Protocol, which Australia acceded to in June 1988. The 1984 Protocol was expressed to enter into force when ratified by ten countries, including six which have at least one million gross tons of tanker tonnage. While thirteen countries, including Australia, have ratified the Protocol to date, only two have the required minimum tanker tonnage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the International Maritime Organisation, which administers the Convention, has recognised that the 1984 Protocol is unlikely to gain the required ratification by countries with the minimum tonnage unless it is ratified by the United States, the world's leading oil importer. This is now unlikely to occur, as the liability provisions of the United States' Oil Pollution Act 1990 are inconsistent with those of the CLC Protocol and therefore preclude US ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the 1992 Protocol was adopted as a replacement Protocol, with the only substantive alteration to the earlier Protocol being a less restrictive entry into force provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 will reduce the maximum crew level for eligibility for a grant from 23 to 18. This accords with the existing crewing practices in the Australian Trading Fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY (NON-BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives legislative force to a number of non-budget measures, improving the effectiveness and delivery of a wide range of social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several initiatives are to assist families, especially those taking on new parental responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements, family payment for a newborn child is backdated to the child's birth if a claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the birth. Similarly, when a newborn child is placed with an adoptive parent, family payment is backdated to the time when the child entered the parent's care if the form is lodged within 13 weeks of the child's birth. However, there is no backdating provision for people who adopt older, rather than newborn, children. These people may be paid only from the date of claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that arrears of family payment may be paid from the date a child enters an adoptive parent's care if the claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the date the child is placed in the person's care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently, when a person who is receiving family payment for one or more children takes on the care of a new child, whether by birth or adoption, it is unnecessary for the person to lodge a new claim for the new child. It is sufficient to notify the Department of the addition to the family for the increased rate to be paid. However, there is currently no rule allowing the increased rate to be backdated to the new child's birth or the date the new child came </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">into the person's care. Accordingly, the rate may be increased only from the first family payment payday after the actual birth or the date the new child came into the person's care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes amendments to allow rate increases for second and subsequent family payment children to be backdated if the Department is notified of the birth of the second or subsequent child within 13 weeks of the birth or the date the child came into the person's care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional family payment rates applicable to children under the age of 16, are adjusted each year on 1 January so that the sum of the combined basic family payment and additional family payment does not fall below a certain percentage (benchmarks of adequacy) of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate. From 1 January 1995, additional family payment rates applicable to children under the age of 16 were increased by $1 per week as a result of a decision taken in the 1993-94 Budget context. To preserve the benefit of the $1 increase, this bill changes the current level of benchmarks of adequacy so that the increased rates of additional family payment are reflected in the benchmarks. Therefore, from 1 January 1996, additional family payment rates will increase in line with the higher benchmarks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sole parent pension is currently available to people bringing up children on their own, in a number of situations. People may qualify if they are not members of a couple, or, if they are members of a couple but living separately and apart from their partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act as it is currently drafted, does not require the separation be permanent or indefinite. As a result, people could qualify for sole parent pension if they were living separately and apart from their partners on a strictly temporary basis. It was never the intention that a person might qualify for sole parent pension because, for example, their partner was going overseas on a holiday or was required to be away from home temporarily for work reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the act to ensure that the principle that people living separately and apart from their partners on a strictly temporary basis do not qualify for sole parent pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will not, nor are they intended, to reduce the financial and other assistance provided by the Department of Social Security to people at risk of, or who have sustained, domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also introduces special measures to assist those people in our community caring for disabled relatives or friends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One measure concerns the current inconsistency that a frail or disabled person may travel overseas for a holiday without their own social security entitlement being affected, whereas their carer may not accompany them because carer pension is generally not portable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment allows a carer pensioner to accompany the person being cared for overseas without loss of qualification, provided that the period of absence is temporary and does not exceed 3 months. This will permit a disabled person to retain the support of their carer while travelling overseas to visit their homeland, for example, or seek medical treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since July 1993, carer pensioners have been entitled to participate in employment or education and training within the limitations imposed by their caring role. However, while long term recipients of many social security payments are entitled to an employment entry payment assisting them with the costs of starting employment and an education entry payment to assist with the costs of taking up study, these entitlements have not been available to carer pensioners. This bill introduces an employment entry payment of $100 and an education entry payment of $200 for carer pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also introduces measures to assist people claiming sickness allowance. The requirement to serve an ordinary waiting period is removed if the Social Security Secretary is satisfied that it will cause the person severe financial hardship. A similar rule already applies to people who claim job search and newstart allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mobility allowance is provided to assist with transport costs incurred by disabled people. It is generally payable to handicapped people who are in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary work or certain approved job search activities. Disabled recipients of job search, newstart or youth training allowance are necessarily engaged in job search activities and yet they have not had access to mobility allowance for technical reasons. This bill ensures that these people will have access to mobility allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1993, an amendment to the Social Security Act 1991 extended the availability of fringe benefits to all disability support pensioners, regardless of income, for 12 months after their payments ceased. However, the continuation of fringe benefits was unintentionally restricted to pensioners who lose their qualification because they commence full time work. It does not extend to those whose pension is cancelled because of their earnings but who do not commence full time work. The dependent pensioner partners (ie, wife or carer pensioners) of these disability support pensioners also lose their entitlement to a fringe benefit extension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made by this bill allow customers whose disability support pension is cancelled because of their earnings, whether from full time work or not, to retain their eligibility for fringe benefits for a period of 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, disability support pensioners who lose qualification as a result of commencing full time work may have their pensions suspended (for a period of 2 years), rather than cancelled. Should they again become qualified for disability support pension during that 2 year period, an accelerated restoration process replaces the need for a new claim. This provision, introduced as part of the Disability Reform Package, was designed to serve as an incentive for customers to attempt employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, however, pensioners whose disability support pensions are cancelled because of their earnings from part time work would have their pensions cancelled upon expiry of any earnings credit. Such people would have to undergo a new claim assessment process if they again become eligible for pension. As a result, a disincentive exists for people to attempt part time work, the only option available to many disability support pensioners. This is contrary to the spirit of the Disability Reform Package. This bill applies the 2 year suspension rule to all persons whose disability support pensions cease because of their earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Partner allowance commenced in September 1994 as a direct payment to the dependent partner of a recipient of job search, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit. The payment had previously been made as an add-on to the rate paid to the allowance or benefit recipient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, partner allowance may only be paid 14 days in arrears. This may disadvantage some people in some cases if a person's partner is granted job search, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit more than 14 days before the lodgment of a claim for partner allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To address this problem the bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that partner allowance may be backdated to the date the person's partner claims job search, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit, provided the claim for partner allowance is made within 14 days of the partner's claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of amendments to the job search and newstart programs. Specifically, the bill allows the Social Security Secretary the option of requiring a person to attend a particular place for a particular purpose as a condition of payment of job search or newstart allowance. This option will be exercised in situations where, for example, the Secretary considers that a particular program information session held outside DSS and the CES would be valuable for the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also amends provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 relating to the appropriation of money from which job search and newstart training supplements are paid, to more accurately reflect the source of those funds. Entitlement to the supplement is contingent on approval of participation in a vocational training program or labour market program by the Employment Secretary. This approval is not subject to review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of amendments to simplify, and make more equitable, the cancellation and debt recovery provisions of the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain provisions operate to create a debt when a person receives a payment that is calculated at a rate greater than the correct maximum payment rate. This applies whether or not the person notified the Department of a change in circumstances and the debt commences from the date of the relevant event or change in circumstances. As the debt incurred will be the same whether or not the Department is advised, this acts as a disincentive for people to notify the Department of changes in circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide an incentive for social security recipients to notify promptly, changes in circumstances, and to ensure that treatment is consistent with the treatment of other recipients who notify changes resulting in loss of qualification, this bill ensures that recipients who notify a change in circumstances that affects the maximum payment rate will incur a debt, only from the end of the notification period. This allows them a period of grace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current legislation, there is a clear distinction between qualification and payability for a social security payment. The general scheme of the Social Security Act 1991 is that payment is no longer payable to a person who loses qualification for it. However, the debt recovery provisions are not as clear on this point as they might be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to ensure that, once a social security recipient has lost qualification, the recipient will have no further entitlement to payments. This proposal does not disturb the current rules that allow for the continuation of payment to the end of the notification period. Rather, it provides an incentive for clients to notify a change in circumstances within the prescribed period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are an estimated 170 local exchange trading systems or similar community exchange programs in existence nationally, the largest with 1500 members. As goods and services are exchanged without recourse to money, these systems are a useful community initiative, particularly in representing a form of activity that helps social security recipients keep contact with labour market skills and habits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, goods and services provided in return for non-cash credits are assessed as income for the purposes of the income test in the Social Security Act 1991, which discourages participation in these schemes. This bill exempts certain non-cash credits from the income test to overcome this disincentive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to allow notice of a decision to be given to a person for the purposes of the Act if that notice is sent by pre-paid post to a person's post office box last known to the Secretary. This amendment clarifies the Department's response to a number of Federal Court decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make amendments that will allow the Minister for Social Security to declare, by notice in writing and published in the Gazette, a particular class of debt that may be waived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment recognises the development of a data matching program between the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office's Reportable Payments System (RPS) in relation to the incomes of non-PAYE tax payers. The amendment will enable particular classes of debts arising under the Principal Act to be waived for those who would be affected by the new data matching program and who volunteer advice to the Department of Social Security about their true circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 20 March 1995, a new payment type, income support supplement, will be introduced into the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The arrangements for carer pension need to take into account the introduction of income support supplement. Unless the carer pension provisions are amended, carer pensioners will lose qualification for carer pension if they care for a person who receives an income support supplement instead of a social security payment. Accordingly, the bill includes amendments that deal with various carer pension provisions to ensure that carer pensioners are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the income support supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also makes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my duty to speak on the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. It is good to see us eventually getting on to it at almost 10 minutes past 11. I must say that I am pleased that the legislation had been put off until the parliament was able to hear from Senator Baume about the disgraceful manner in which he has been treated in relation to his electorate office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume wants to put his office in a place which needs decent representation in New South Wales, a place in the vicinity of where Senator Baume lives. This would normally have been granted without question; if Senator Baume had been a Labor man, that would have happened but, because he is a Liberal senator and because he has taken on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), this has been refused by a member of the Labor Party who happens to hold the ministry responsible for these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that we are able to get on to this legislation. I also thought that perhaps it would have been delayed a little longer so that someone from the Labor Party could have apologised to Senator Abetz because of the disgraceful smear made against him by the member for Bass, Mrs Smith. It seems, from what Senator Abetz said&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sherry" NAMEID="ZW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The points that Senator Ian Macdonald is making are not relevant to the bill which is before you at the present time, and there is a limit to our tolerance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Herron)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! There is no point of order. He said this in introduction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I can understand why in particular Senator Sherry, coming from Tasmania, and Senator Coates, also from Tasmania, would be very sensitive about these matters. I am indicating that this particular bill before us has been delayed because of those matters, and I am pleased that we are getting on with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would have been much happier had it been delayed further to allow Senator Sherry or Senator Coates, or someone from the Labor Party, to apologise to Senator Abetz for the disgraceful allegations made by the member for Bass against Senator Abetz. Senator Abetz very clearly and concisely raised that point earlier. I just would have hoped that someone from the Labor Party would have had the courage and courtesy to apologise for that disgraceful smear&mdash;a typical Labor Party smear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 makes some amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. Again, it is good to see that at last the environment department is doing something that is a little positive in relation to its area of portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This department would have to be the worst department in the whole of the Commonwealth administration&mdash;and that is saying something. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would remember that it is this department that has overseen the woodchips, forest coupes, forest policy fiasco that has now been going on for over two years simply because this government has been unable to implement the national forest policy statement&mdash;something that Senator Faulkner was totally involved in, but something he has been unable to manage through his department. So the department, because of the fairly obvious political influences within it these days, has made a complete fiasco of that&mdash;and they are not my words; they are the words of former Labor senator Peter Walsh, who describes that forest policy issue as an `absolute fiasco' by Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would also be aware that this is the department which has been involved in the Oyster Point fiasco up in North Queensland. The Queensland state Labor government granted permission for a developer to go ahead in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park waters, just adjacent to Hinchinbrook Island. The Queensland state Labor government had gone through the environmental considerations very carefully and had given approval to the developer. Then, at the eleventh hour, the Commonwealth came in over the top and stopped development, stopped an enormous number of jobs in that area and, really, sent all the wrong sorts of signals to the foreign investors whom we desperately need&mdash;particularly in North Queensland&mdash;to get the economy moving and provide jobs for young Queenslanders. So this is that department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, this is the department that has been involved in the Magnetic Keys fiasco off Townsville. This has been another instance where the environment minister has simply overridden the Queensland government and, in doing so, has cost economic development and jobs for people in the Townsville area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, this is the department which, and the minister who, promised to give us some details of the $120,000-plus which was paid to conservation groups, as so-called professional experts and consultants, in relation to the forest coupes assessment. Those acquittals were supposed to be tabled in parliament. They eventually were. They were one-line items which told the parliament absolutely nothing. We still do not know how much Natalie and others received for the work they did&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator O'Chee" NAMEID="EU4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or who Natalie is; quite right, Senator O'Chee. She certainly was not listed as one of the so-called experts who were, or was supposed to have been, engaged. At hearings of the estimates committee I was told that the minister would try to get me&mdash;try to get me, mind you; this shows how much the minister is in charge of his department&mdash;those acquittals. But here we are, some two to three weeks later, still with no decent acquittals to tell the parliament and the people of Australia how their money has been spent on what all of us can quite clearly see was a fairly blatant political exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is, again, part of that from a department which has made that complete fiasco of the forest policy issue. It is interesting to note that it is a matter where government members are all over the shop with it. In fact, Mr Keating it appears, according to Senator Faulkner, told a lie to the Australian public in commenting on it. In a press conference on 27 January 1995, in relation to the assessment process, Mr Keating stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and he&mdash;along with the Minister for Resources&mdash;have met and discussed these various coupes and judged it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Keating said about Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall. At an estimates committee on 16 February I asked Senator Faulkner whether that was true, whether he did actually meet with the Minister for Resources, as the Prime Minister had told the Australian public. After two pages of equivocation in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Senator Faulkner eventually admitted `at the time of that press conference I had not had a formal discussion'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is fairly clear that the Prime Minister lied to the Australian public at that press conference on 27 January 1995, at a time when this whole process was very important and very much in the public gaze. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, that is the department we are dealing with. You can understand from that my claim that it is the worst administered, worst managed department in the whole of a government which is pretty well noted for its lack of accountability and lack of administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the Senate makes amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and it provides for an additional member of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to represent the interests of Aboriginal people living adjacent to the park. It also provides for increases in penalties under the act, the making of statutory management plans, public participation in planning and management, and an increase in the powers of marine park inspectors. The bill also makes minor amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to allow for fees collected under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act to be paid into the national parks and wildlife fund and allows for the use of credit cards by the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first matter, the appointment of an additional member to the authority to represent the interests of Aboriginal people, I should indicate to the Senate that there are currently three members of the authority: the chairman representing the Commonwealth government; a director-general representing the state government; and an independent member representing all other groups. It is true that over the last 12 months Aboriginal groups living adjacent to the reef have had to cope with a plethora of issues on which they are being consulted and that there is a need for a more efficient process to address these issues, particularly in relation to the Great Barrier Reef. These issues have created problems for not only the Aboriginal groups but also other groups which have had an interest in the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 12 months a number of concerns have been brought to my attention, primarily those of tourism operators who have faced serious delays and costs during the authority's processing of permit applications and renewals. The regulation which is at the centre of these concerns is regulation 13AC(4)(b) in the criteria for assessment of applications for permission. This regulation requires that before an application for a permit is approved by the authority the authority must address `the need to protect cultural and heritage values held in relation to the Marine Park by traditional inhabitants and other people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This regulation has become prominent in the authority's permit processing over the last year with the introduction of the native title legislation and the acknowledgment of Aboriginal associations with land and sea areas in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park vicinity. The authority has stated that it now spends up to 10 per cent of its total resources on addressing Aboriginal and Islander concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently companies which wish to operate or develop within an area where there may be an Aboriginal association have to advertise their intention to develop or operate in the area and then provide an information kit to the authority to be distributed to groups which may have concerns. If there are no responses from the groups involved to these actions, the authority contacts the groups for a response. Once an interest has been voiced by Aboriginal groups in relation to the permit, usually in response to the authority's contact, negotiations begin between the groups involved and the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have been raised with me that the authority, in addressing these regulations, is prompting and encouraging Aboriginal groups to take issue with permit applications. The main concerns I have, however, relate to the negotiation process or, should I say, the lack of it. There are no guidelines or plans in place for this negotiation process. Neither operators nor the Aboriginal groups are clearly advised who they are to deal with, how they are to go about the negotiations or how long the process will take. As well, the interests of Aboriginal groups in the area are usually not clearly defined and no proof of their association appears to be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been several reports of Aboriginal groups not turning up to organised negotiation meetings, and there have been other reports that outside sources have given groups questions to ask at meetings which have little relevance to the group's needs. Without specifically naming any companies, but to give senators some ideas of the problems which are occurring, I mention a couple of the following as examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One company in Cairns was recently refused approval for a multimillion dollar pontoon proposal near Green Island. The pontoon concept was developed over two years and involved many thousands of dollars of investment. The authority's reason for not allowing the permit was simply that the company had not satisfied regulation 13AC(4)(b), which is that regulation I spoke of previously. So, after all that money, the company was simply told it had not satisfied the regulation. No other explanation was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another company which has been operating in the outer Barrier Reef for five years was recently advised, on applying for a renewal of its operator's permit, that it had to contact three Aboriginal groups in the area to see if its operations would affect any interest these groups may have in the area. The authority then contacted these groups asking of any association they had with the area, what impact on that association the company's activities might have and whether they approved of the company continuing operation in the area. The company's permit will not be renewed until these groups have responded. This company has invested over $20 million in this operation, and it employs over 100 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, another company was delayed for 20 months and faced added costs of over $10,000 before its mooring rights were approved in the Michaelmas Cay off Cairns. After lengthy and uncertain negotiations with Aboriginal groups and the authority, the company agreed to employ members of the Aboriginal group claiming an interest in it and, subsequently, the permit was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment in tourism is a very high risk area, with foreign investment typically more sensitive to elements adversely affecting the investment risk. The uncertainty which has been created by this unworkable permitting process is deterring further investment locally and new investment from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that it has been a learning process for the authority, Aboriginal groups and business people and that it has had to deal with a large number of permit applications whilst at the same time satisfying requirements under the legislation. However, this uncertainty has to be contained. It has been suggested to me by respected tourism industry leaders that there is a lack of understanding and knowledge in the authority about tourism and other industries' interests in the marine park as well as Aboriginal interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the minister, in the appointment of the person to the authority, to look not only at that person's ability to represent Aboriginal groups but also at their ability to appropriately address tourism and other industry interests in the marine park. I think it is essential that this person who is appointed has experience in business and can take a balanced approach to addressing all concerns in relation to negotiating Aboriginal associations with the park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a priority, I urge the newly appointed member to have the authority establish clear guidelines where Aboriginal groups and industry can productively negotiate their interests in the reef. It is essential that a plan be put in place so that both parties are given a clear direction. The authority should perhaps also look at establishing a time frame for negotiations to ensure that, by a specific date, any residual uncertainty as to the existence of an Aboriginal interest in the area can be clarified and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority should also investigate the establishment of a register which clearly indicates which areas of the reef are affected by which particular Aboriginal association to ensure that the tourism industry can properly prepare for negotiations on proposed and existing permits. Similarly, Aboriginal groups should be informed of all current and proposed industry activity within the marine park waters. The authority also needs to establish better understanding or definitions of cultural heritage values. There have been very broad ambit descriptions of Aboriginal cultural interests in the marine park in the past. It may be worth the authority looking at whether that needs greater definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be necessary to establish some process whereby the Aboriginal association with the reef can be clarified before negotiations with industry begin. There is also a need for assistance to be given where appropriate to Aboriginal groups to establish an administrative and decision making structure to deal professionally with these types of negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I will briefly comment on is the increased penalties and increased powers of inspectors. These amendments seem to be a positive step towards ensuring that the authority has the ability to assist in the prevention of smuggling from Great Barrier Reef waters. There has been some concerns expressed about that and I raised the issue in the estimate committees. The department indicated to me that these reports in the Queensland media had been investigated and had been found not to be accurate. They included reports about the use of cyanide on the reef. That is a very serious accusation and, hopefully, that is something that the department and the Queensland fisheries people will keep in mind. There are other provisions in this bill which will increase penalties for those misusing the reef. I submit that we need to do more to ensure that this type of illegal activity does not continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been contacted by a number of users of the reef who have some reservations about the amendments to this bill which allow for the establishment of management plans by the authority. While it is important that the reef is managed by a sound plan, there is some concern that these amendments will give the authority power to make decisions on access and actions with regard to the reef area without requiring supporting parliamentary legislation. I understand from the research service that any such plans will be subject to regulations that can be disallowed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have been raised with me about amendments which clarify and increase the powers of the marine park inspectors. I have had some conflicting advice in this area and will be pursuing that in the committee stage, but I again simply urge the government to monitor these amendments to make sure that there are no unintended consequences. The coalition will be generally supporting the amendments. I hear that Senator Coulter has some committee stage amendments that he will be moving. We have not even seen them yet. How he expects me to deal with or comment on those, I do not know. At this stage, we will not agree to those amendments when they are moved because we simply have not seen them. </PARA>

We are the custodians of the Great Barrier Reef not just for future generations of Australians but also for future generations of people from other countries. We are not just the custodians of the reef for humans; we also have to care for the reef so that the complex ecologies which compose the reef will persist in the indefinite future and will continue to evolve and carry out their processes of evolution and ecological interaction as if they had not been impacted upon by human intervention. That, after all, is what the long-term objective of conservation must be&mdash;so that it remains a wondrous area in which humans intrude to wonder, to research, to look at but not to impact so as to cause damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times one has seen quite a number of alarming happenings in relation to the Great Barrier Reef which need to be taken note of. For instance, there is the increase in sea temperature to which many people have drawn attention. In the Caribbean, for instance, and to some extent in the northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef, one sees the loss of coral species possibly related to the increase in sea temperature. That would seem now to be an inevitable process because we are both as a nation and as a species on this planet inevitably going to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increase the further temperature of the ocean. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to that increase in carbon dioxide, one has seen some alarming data on the way in which corals take carbonate out of the water and put it into building the reef structure. The ability of corals and other animals to take carbonate from the water depends critically on the carbonate-bicarbonate balance in the ocean. That balance has been quite seriously disturbed by the increase in carbon dioxide and the move from carbonate towards bicarbonate which will make it more difficult for corals and other species to take up carbon dioxide in the form or carbonate and sequester it in their shells. This is clearly a long-term hazard to the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is also aware of the fact that there is increasing silting on the reef as a consequence of damage which has occurred on the contiguous shoreline. The growing of sugar cane particularly, which has gone too close to many of the creeks and rivers in northern Queensland, has resulted in silt being carried down and silt being deposited on the corals. At the same time, one has seen an increase in the nutrient load in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef which also disturbs the ecological balance of the reef. For instance, the balance between the algae and the corals themselves is disturbed in favour of algae which could in fact have quite a damaging long-term effect on the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all matters to which our attention has been drawn in recent months and years. They are all matters which seem, at the moment, not to be fully controlled. They are all matters which presage damage to the reef. I point out to Senator Ian MacDonald that they are all matters which, in the longer term, if uncontrolled, would in fact remove the reef from its ability to support a buoyant tourist industry. So they are all matters to which government and the people of Australia need to pay very close attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all this, I come to one of the points in our suggested amendments. I am rather surprised at what Senator Ian MacDonald has just said about those amendments, because they were circulated in the chamber yesterday. There was plenty of opportunity for him, as the person in this chamber responsible for dealing with those amendments, to look at those. Having had plenty of opportunity to look at them, it ill behoves him to suggest that he has not considered them. But I suggest to him that he consider the purpose of these, which is very simple. The first amendment is to write into the amending bill the precautionary principle and to pick up in that way some of the damaging developments which are occurring on the reef and other damaging developments which may occur which need to be covered by management plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, I was a bit surprised to hear him criticise the development of management plans. There is a justified criticism of the government over management plans in the Lake Eyre suggested world heritage area and in the Willandra Lake area. I do not think the opposition can have it both ways. If there are to be management plans, there are to be management plans, and they should be adequately exposed to public gaze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the barrier reef, it is absolutely appropriate that those management plans not only be developed but incorporate the precautionary principle, because we are dealing here with a structure which has been in existence for a very long period. It is still changing. It is an evolving structure, and it is, as I have indicated already, being seriously impacted on by very many human interventions, not least of which is the impact of tourism. Tourism is leading very much to, for instance, an increase in nutrients in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Nutrients are one of those things which are disturbing the ecology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald also drew attention to the Magnetic Quays development, which, I would have to agree with him, has been a disaster. Had the precautionary principle been written into management plans earlier, I suspect that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would not have given permission for that development, with its heavy impact of silt on the area around Magnetic Island, to go ahead and it would not have proceeded to this aborted stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address two areas for amendment. The first is the precautionary principle, and I ask that Senator Macdonald think about it. I am sure he is aware of the precautionary principle. I am sure that he would agree with that principle for the reasons I have outlined. All that amendment seeks to do is write the precautionary principle into the development of these management plans. I understand that the government will be supporting that amendment, and I ask Senator Macdonald to think again about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to liability, the second area, we take a somewhat different view from both the government and the opposition. I cannot for the life of me see how the changes which have been made here tighten the liability for damage occurring in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority area. The offences have been changed from indictable to summary offences and several other hurdles have been put in the way of a successful charge being laid against those who damage the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would be moving from a situation where there is strict liability to one where there would be qualified liability depending upon the intention of the person who caused the damage. That, in our view, will weaken the legislation rather than strengthen it. This rather puzzles me in particular because if, say, a toxic substance such as cyanide, to use Senator Macdonald's example, were spilt into the reef it would not really matter to the reef whether the placing of that cyanide into the water was done intentionally or not&mdash;the damage will still occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person who offends against, say, a speed limit on the road cannot claim that he or she did not intend to speed&mdash;the speeding is itself the offence. So we take the view that, because the damage will occur whether the act was done intentionally or not, a penalty should be laid against that person. We believe that the government has in this case really placed a barrier in the way of the possibility of successfully prosecuting people who do damage to the reef because they can simply claim that that damage was not intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald also mentioned the Hinchinbrook development. Undoubtedly this will place a further considerable impact on that part of the reef&mdash;Hinchinbrook Island and Hinchinbrook Channel, which are near this development, even though the development is on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the administration of the Great Barrier Reef is hampered by lack of funds and given, as I understand it, that in the Hinchinbrook area there is only one national park ranger to supervise both the Hinchinbrook Channel and the whole of Hinchinbrook Island, which is a large one, it seems to me that those who place these greater impacts on a world heritage area have the responsibility to significantly contribute to the protection of the area which will be impacted by their development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, I strongly urge the minister to suggest that those who would develop the so-called Oyster Point development, such as Mr Keith Williams, should contribute perhaps an extra two rangers at their expense in perpetuity to supervise the activities of those who stay at this tourist development, should that tourist development proceed to the point where it contains the very large numbers of people Mr Williams said it will contain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people should be a part of the national park service; they should not be within the employ of Mr Keith Williams or whoever runs the development. They should certainly be independent and able to monitor the impacts. Under the precautionary principle, they should be able to then advise the Queensland government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority that certain damages are occurring and how under the precautionary principle that damage should be contained and further prevented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supporting this legislation as we believe that it improves the present administration and management in this area, but in the committee stage we will be moving those two areas of amendment. I understand that the government is supporting the precautionary principle. I will argue further for strict liability when we get to the committee stage of the bill. </PARA>

As I said, we should at all times acknowledge its special role and the need for close and continuing consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are well aware from today's media that the issue of the republic is once again on the agenda and has been placed there squarely by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on his current trip to Germany. It is also quite coincidental that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon) is also in Germany at this same time. I wonder whether he is also looking at the issue of republicanism and how it might affect Australia's external territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we, and Norfolk Islanders, would want to ensure that the federal government does not ride roughshod over the views of the Norfolk Islanders. The days of paternalism are over. The federal government must listen closely to the views of the Norfolk Island community and not impose its policies from afar, whether from Australia or from a prime minister and a parliamentary secretary currently in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point was brought home to me by a report I read recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Norfolk Islander</EMPHASIS>, the local newspaper, dated 10 December 1994. It concerned a visit to the island by the parliamentary secretary, Mr Warren Snowdon. The report, in part, read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conversation with Mr. Snowdon the question of the Australian Republic was raised. Mr Snowdon is a staunch Republican, he even has a watch to prove it, and we asked him where Norfolk Island would stand if the question of Australia becoming a Republic were put to the vote?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that Australians in Norfolk Island would be involved in the referendums the same as Australians in the mainland and that when Australia became a Republic, which he seems to believe is a foregone conclusion, that Norfolk Islanders, `would just have to cop it sweet'.</PARA>
<PARA>What a disgraceful statement from a parliamentary secretary for territories: that a number of people would just have to `cop it sweet' because of their unique and special constitutional arrangement. That is an horrific statement. It has portents not only for Norfolk Island but also for Christmas Island and Cocos Island. Each of these communities is, to some extent, adolescent in constitutional terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Christmas Island, which was declared an Australian territory in 1958, we see that the island residents participated in federal elections for the first time in only 1984 as part of the federal Northern Territory electorate. That is quite symbolic and important. The following year, the Christmas Island assembly was formed and recently we have seen a new legal regime, a capital works program and economic and town planning initiatives, all of which highlight the controversy involved in looking to the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Christmas Island is coming of age in a constitutional sense, there are some fundamental questions that need to be addressed. I will flag some of them here. How, for example, will the eventual statehood of the Northern Territory affect Christmas Island? Will the islanders be able to, or want to, remain part of the Northern Territory electorate or will they prefer to be included in Western Australia as a shire or attached to the Australian Capital Territory, as Norfolk Island has recently been done, for federal election purposes for Australian residents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the debate on Australia becoming a republic? Will the views of Norfolk Islanders, Christmas Islanders and Cocos Islanders matter? What are the constitutional options for Norfolk Island or Christmas Island? Is an island plebiscite needed in each of those cases?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, as the shadow minister for external territories and also the Country Liberal Party senator for the Northern Territory, which embraces the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, I am interested in the views of those residents. But obviously Mr Snowdon is not. He is also the member of the House of Representatives for Cocos and Christmas Islands, but he has given a portent of his feelings by telling Norfolk Islanders that they are just going to have to `cop it sweet'. Are the Christmas and Cocos Islanders also going to have to `cop it sweet' in relation to suggestions that Mr Snowdon obviously believes that, as the lackey of Mr Keating, he is going to have to develop the same republican views?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the coalition has flagged that after the next federal election it will proceed to a centennial convention in order to conduct a 100-year review of the Australian constitution. The coalition wants to give the Australian people their proper voice in a review of our constitution. That also includes the residents of Norfolk Island, of Christmas Island and of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It is not this `cop it sweet' mentality of Mr Keating, who seems to be wandering around in Germany pre-ordaining the way in which Australians will cop a president sweet or the way in which Mr Snowdon is going to tell the residents of these various islands how they should be part of Australia in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to run a major inquiry into the infrastructure of the island community, we must make sure that self-government really means something for that particular island.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that we will have another opportunity in this Senate to look at the report of the joint standing committee in detail because it does canvass a number of issues on all three islands that need to be urgently addressed. Certainly the constitutional issues need to be addressed. I note, in particular, that the report highlighted gaping holes in the quarantine services that were addressed on Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. As this is part of my electorate, it naturally is a major issue of concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also looks at environmental issues and the fact that exotic pests have been introduced into Christmas Island over the years is relevant. A federal parliamentary inquiry is now pointing the finger very specifically at quarantine. The federal government has a direct responsibility for quarantine and must take urgent action to ensure that Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island are properly protected in the future. I am concerned that the report tabled this week highlights very major issues of concern for Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. With regard to Christmas Island, the report states:</PARA>

<PARA>There are two areas in which the Democrats are seeking to amend this legislation: the area which relates to strict liability, and the area, as I indicated earlier, which relates to the writing into the bill of the management plans which regulate the use of the precautionary principle.

I have moved the strict liability amendments as a block and will move the final amendment by itself. There is a slight rewording of that, which has also been circulated. It slightly changes the wording in relation to the precautionary principle, and I understand that that has been agreed to, but I will deal with the first set of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975&mdash;and I will refer to a couple of sections in that, because this is quite repetitive&mdash;is the act which this bill seeks to amend. I will refer to two sections only&mdash;section 38(4) and section 38A&mdash;because we can pick up the arguments with respect to those, and the same arguments apply to the other amendments. In the act as it stands at the moment, subsection 38(4) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person who:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) contravenes subsection (2); or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)having obtained the approval of the Authority under subsection (3) for the carrying on of operations for the recovery of minerals, carries on operations for the recovery of minerals otherwise than in accordance with that approval;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is guilty of an offence punishable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>et cetera. So the present legislation says that a person who carries out an act which is not in conformity, in this case with the approval, is guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amending bill, which we are seeking to amend by removing certain words, seeks to put in there that the person intentionally or negligently does those things. In other words, as I read it, the prosecution would have to prove not that the thing was not done, not that there was not damage to the reef, not that that damage may, in fact, be very considerable damage but that the person had the intention to cause that damage or to do that thing; or, and the other word, `negligently'&mdash;that the person did the thing which may indeed have caused damage, including considerable damage, but that they did it negligently. So, quite contrary to the government's claim that this section is being strengthened, in our view it is being weakened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I use the second example, the same principle applies. Section 38A of the bill reads that a person shall not use or enter a zone `for a purpose other than a purpose that is permitted under the zoning plan that relates to the zone'. Then there is a penalty&mdash;if the offender is a natural person or if the offender is a body corporate&mdash;of so much. Again, a person shall not `use or enter a zone for a purpose other than a purpose that is permitted'. A person shall not do those things. Yet the government is seeking, in our view, to weaken this legislation in a number of areas by putting in that the charge has to be accompanied by proof that the action was carried out intentionally or negligently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that here we are dealing with two very important principles which are in conflict. If one is dealing with many human interactions, I can see some sense in putting in the words `intelligently or negligently' because the consequences of certain actions may be partial, may be temporary and may be repairable. In the case of human actions in dealing with the environment, many of those actions will result in damage whether or not the action was carried out intentionally or negligently. Surely, the function of this act and the function of the amending bill, which would then become part of the act, should be to protect the Great Barrier Reef. The function should not be there to protect those people who carry out activities which damage the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us&mdash;and I reiterate&mdash;to very significantly weaken this legislation if the prosecution has to prove intention or negligence. It is for those reasons that I would urge most strongly that this set of amendments, which seeks quite simply to maintain the act in its present form, in fact, is the set of words which will best ensure the protection of the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other change as to whether it be an indictable offence or summary offence, again, it seems to us that that, to a degree, weakens the legislation. However, it does expedite the processes by which such offences can be dealt with&mdash;and we have no objection to that. But this particular amendment which the government is seeking to put in, I think, puts very considerable hurdles in the way of a successful conviction. It may, in fact, lead to very significant damage occurring to the reef and no ability whatsoever on the part of the prosecuting authority to obtain any sanction or recompense against the person who carries out that damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I urge the Senate very strongly to review very carefully what the government has claimed with respect to these words, because I believe that they mean the opposite to that which has been claimed by the government, and to maintain the act in its present form. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet, I quickly pick up the fact that as I understand it we are not talking about criminal offences anyway; we are talking about summary offences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example I gave earlier was of a speeding offence. If one exceeds the speed limit, one is guilty of the offence whether one did it intentionally or accidentally. However, if one were to go into court and say to the magistrate, `I was speeding, but I had a sick child in the car and I was taking that child to hospital. The road was clear', and all the other evidence is that it was safe to speed, I am sure under those circumstances the magistrate would in fact impose a lesser penalty. Courts always take those sorts of things into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here one is providing a let-out. Simply by establishing that the act was not done intentionally or negligently one escapes entirely any penalty whatsoever. No mitigating circumstances can be taken into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see what it says in the memorandum. I do agree with one point Senator Coulter made in his other argument.

I do not say that that makes it right or wrong, but I do agree with him on that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I just indicate that we are going to oppose all of these amendments because we saw them for the first time only an hour ago. If Senator Coulter and the Democrats were serious about getting these amendments through, rather than just doing a bit of political grandstanding for their ever diminishing support base, then they would ensure that the relevant person on the coalition was aware of these amendments and had a view of them. Senator Coulter&mdash;from a party with seven senators, shortly to be reduced to about two, and representing about four per cent of the electorate&mdash;may not understand that parties like the Liberal and National parties, which represent 50 per cent of the Australian electorate and have almost 100 parliamentarians, do have a process which has to be gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case Senator Coulter is not aware&mdash;although I know he is&mdash;Mr Ian McLachlan is the coalition spokesman on environment matters, and I represent him in the Senate. I would have thought that, as a matter of courtesy, Senator Coulter or his office might have, at the very least, contacted my office and said, `Well, what is your view on these?' or `Are you aware of these things?' or `We're serious about getting these passed, so we want to come and argue the case with you,' or, better still, `We want to go and argue it with the shadow minister.' I know Senator Coulter has done that in the past with Mr McLachlan. Mr McLachlan and his office have not seen these amendments at all. I saw them yesterday, and I thought you interjected and said that they were distributed yesterday. As I recall, the Senate did not discuss this matter yesterday. It discussed only one particular item yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not had a chance to look at these amendments and they certainly were not terribly well explained by Senator Coulter when he spoke in support of them. With respect, I know that this is not in the portfolio of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats are serious about these matters rather than just pandering to their ever decreasing support vote, then Senator Coulter should really make us aware of the amendments and make sure we understand what he is talking about.

They are not too serious about real legislation, it is just a bit of grandstanding on their part. When there are only seven Democrats there is never any likelihood that any of their policies will be put into effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be voting against these amendments. I have tried to follow the arguments as Senator Coulter put them. As I understand it your amendments simply leave the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 exactly as it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to those sections. The government is amending these sections to introduce an intention or negligence element. I agree with Senator Coulter in one respect that it does seem that the government's amendments do not do what its explanatory memorandum says they will do. They do the exact opposite. By your amendments you are saying that there should be a strict liability in relation to these offences. Whether a person means it or not they are liable. I understand that that is your interpretation of the original bill and that is what you want to do via your amendments which stop the government amending the legislation in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I follow your argument correctly, I would think&mdash;and I have not had the opportunity to consult with Mr McLachlan&mdash;that as a matter of general philosophy we would be opposed to your proposal and we would support the government's attempt to remove that strict liability and make people guilty of what appears to be an indictable offence and dealt with summarily by penalties of 200 penalty points. I must confess that I am too far out of the law to remember exactly what that currently means, but in relation to the old bill it was around the $10,000 mark. I do not know whether gaol sentences are provided for because I have not read the 1975 act well enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strict liability provisions in any legislation should be dealt with very cautiously and should appear very rarely. I wonder whether the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has looked at the Democrats' amendments. I can see that they return the act to what it originally was. I think the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would be quite horrified by these amendments. As a party that is supposedly gung-ho on civil liberties and the rights of the citizen, it seems to me quite amazing that you are putting an inanimate object, the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;I suppose you would call it a living object, magnificent though it is and protected as it must be&mdash;in front of the rights of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with strict liability. I repeat that I read the act for the first time a few minutes ago. I am not sure whether Senator Coulter has ever been on the waters of the barrier reef, but I have been there a number of times. From where I live, the barrier reef is some 80 kilometres away. Certainly in that area of the barrier reef there are no distinguishing features; there is just flat sea. You cannot see the reef under the water. I have always been amazed, when I have been out with skippers who know the area, how they can head for somewhere&mdash;no doubt they use a compass and, in these later days, satellites as well&mdash;and just from a feeling look around the sea and say, `This is where we are going.' They are very experienced people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there would be a lot of people, when they are 80 kilometres out, who quite innocently stray into an area. They may catch a fish or perhaps pull up a bit of coral. I am not sure whether coral is within the definition of mineral that is spoken about in one of the examples Senator Coulter used. People can do things innocently. They do not mean it. They do not intend it. If they had control over what they were doing, they certainly would not be doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter will find that most people who use the reef are the greatest protectionists and the greatest environmentalists of it because they know its beauty, its value and its sheer wonderment. I often get the feeling that Senator Coulter's group thinks that people who live there, or go near there, or use it, or use it for tourism are just environmental vandals. Quite the contrary is the case. They are people who understand its value and who want to do what they can to protect it. But things do happen beyond the control of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some provisions of the Queensland criminal code that specifically exempt acts that occur beyond the intention of the party. I think they are sections 22 and 23 of the Queensland criminal code, but I am not sufficiently a constitutional lawyer to give the Senate a treatise on how that code would impact upon Commonwealth legislation. There are things that are done innocently, quite accidentally, without any malice, without even any thought and not recklessly. Under the government's amendments, if acts were done negligently, the people responsible would be caught. If there were just a sheer disregard for anything, if it were just willy-nilly stuff and people did not care, then, in a very broad way, that would come within the definition of negligence and so, under the government's legislation, they would be caught. The meaning of the word `intentionally' in the government's legislation is quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person might move from one zone to another out on the reef. There is not a line drawn across the water; it is an expanse of water. If they happen to drift somewhere else without any malice, intention or negligence and they cause some damage, it seems a bit unfair and against civil liberties to put that person up for a fine, which used to be $10,000, because of accidental happenings. I suspect the fine is a lot more now and perhaps there is even a gaol sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I correctly interpret the government's original bill, its amendment and Senator Coulter's amendment, we would incline not to agree with Senator Coulter in any case because we think that citizens do have some rights and that citizens should not be thrown into gaol or fined very heavily for things which occur entirely by accident. So, on that basis, we would probably not have agreed with Senator Coulter in any case. As I said, we would not have agreed with him because the relevant coalition person has not had the opportunity of looking at these things. </PARA>

He should tell me how section 38(5), which says that an offence against subsection 4 is an indictable offence, converts that to a simple offence. The explanatory memorandum is typical of the Labor Party's complete incompetence in running anything. Perhaps he has a better answer because he is so smart. The one he gave to Senator Coulter is quite right. He wants section 38M repealed. That does away with the indictableness of 38A, for `awful', to 38K, for `Keating'; I say that in case Senator Sherry's hearing is not good. Unless it deals with it somewhere else&mdash;if it does, I ask him to point it out to me&mdash;it does not deal with how it converts section 38 from an indictable offence to a summary offence.</PARA></TALK.START>

The minister can point to no evidence which indicates that there has been harshness in dealing with people. Senator Macdonald has agreed that these amendments weaken the legislation. We have heard that the act as it is allows the courts to take into account mitigating circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the people of Australia the activities of the Softwood/ Percheron group of companies and give voice to the frustration of the members of the association Pine Tree  Register Inc., who are seeking some justice in relation to the way they have been treated by the Percheron group of companies. This group of companies is headed by a Mr Alfred Buchanan of Killara. It has been asserted that Mr Buchanan has behaved in a dishonest and fraudulent manner. It would appear that, because of his activities, investors have been robbed of literally millions of dollars. Despite all that, Mr Buchanan, I have reliably been informed, continues to reside in his Killara mansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the Pecheron group of companies can be summarised as follows: approximately 23,000 people world-wide invested in this group. However, the vast bulk of them, some 17,000, are Australian citizens or residents. Even in my home state of Tasmania the estimate would be hundreds of investors. I have been provided with a list of 131 investors who have had their savings frittered away. These people invested their hard-earned money to the approximate value of $40 million in this group. The investments were made over a three-decade period between 1958 and 1987. The investments made and the contracts entered into concerned the sale, planting, tending and maintenance of pine trees and their ultimate cutting and disposal as timber. The trees were to be established on 52 separate plantations. In exchange for their investments, the investors had had returned to them by December 1991 the princely sum of $54,494. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Percheron group of companies was the subject of an Australian Securities Commission inquiry. Before I go into that inquiry, I should indicate to the Senate that on 1 March 1989, the New South Wales Supreme Court, on application of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission, appointed a receiver of the assets of the 20 companies within the group and of the assets of the managing director, Mr Buchanan. The ASC report found that the growers' investments&mdash;the growers are referred to as the actual investors; they are the ones who put the money in for the plantations&mdash;were an unmitigated disaster because of the misrepresentations, deceptions and mismanagement practised by Mr Buchanan and those associated with him, the failure of the group's auditors to carry out their duties properly, the neglectful attitude of the New South Wales government authorities, in particular, the Crown Solicitor's Office and the Corporation Affairs Commission, over some 27 years, and to a lesser extent the fact that Westpac Bank was prepared to provide references for the group to potential investors, thereby encouraging or at least providing comfort to potential investors. The ASC also found that Mr Buchanan misapplied investors' funds, some of which found their way into a series of trust accounts administered by Standard Charter Bank in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also found that from at least 1982, and probably from at least 1975, the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of the Australian companies in the group with balance dates of 30 June were not prepared as required by statute prior to 30 December in each year. Other findings were that the companies in the group did not hold annual meetings when required; profit and loss accounts and balance sheets were not presented at annual general meetings; records of minutes of some meetings of directors and of shareholders of companies in the group were false; information contained in annual reports of companies in the group, at least until 1985, were false; the accounting records of companies in the group were not kept in such a manner as to allow true and fair accounts to be prepared; and the financial statements of companies in the group did not show a true and fair view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latter part of 1990, the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission approached the New South Wales Attorney-General with a proposal for special legislation to overcome legal problems involved in any liquidation of the group. The group's assets were to be pooled by the special legislation which would then allow Pine Tree investors to share those assets. Since this very detailed report, prepared by the Australian Securities Commission, came about&mdash;there are two volumes running into what I imagine would be about 700 or 800 pages&mdash;not much has happened. It is clear that, because of the terrible tangle weaved by Mr Buchanan and his associates, special legislation is required to give some assistance to these investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a request to the federal government to do something for the approximately 17,000 Australians who invested in good faith in this company. The legal difficulties surrounding this matter are based on the fact that individual investors entered into individual contracts relating to particular plantations. The problem was that, when you traced the money through, the money was not necessarily spent on the plantation for which it was designed. Therefore, it is no longer possible to trace whose money went into which plantation so that returns can be given on the basis of where the people invested. Therefore, in my view and in the view of the 17,000 or so investors from Australia, it would be appropriate that the Australian assets be pooled and shared out equally on a pro rata basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is important because good, hardworking Australians invested their money in the hope that in about 30 years time, after their investment, they might have a little nest egg for their future. As an aside, investment in tree plantations is clearly something that this country should be encouraging to assist the industry and to avoid any further imports of timber into this country. We clearly have sufficient ground to grow and be self-sufficient in timber resources. I would have thought it would be appropriate for the government to send out a message that it is supportive of those people who would seek to invest in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the assets of the Percheron group have been sold since the ASC report. I am reliably informed that, as at 30 September 1994, in excess of $1.2 million has been invested. Unfortunately, the funds cannot be released to the investors until the web is untangled. Really, the only way that this web can be untangled is by way of special legislation. The provisional liquidator of the group, Mr A.R.M. Macintosh, in correspondence dated 15 November 1994, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of special legislation, given the element of uncertainty as to which growers may be entitled to the proceeds of the sale of particular forests and the assumptions which of necessity will need to be made regarding allocation of trees it may be necessary to seek directions from the Court in relation to any proposed distribution to growers.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where very expensive applications will need to be made to the courts to determine how this money is to be spent. Later on, the New South Wales Attorney-General's Department wrote to the legal firm looking after the interests of the Pine Tree Register Inc. The letter, signed by the Director-General of the Attorney-General's Department, dated 16 January 1995, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney General has also had discussions with the Commonwealth Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, to determine whether the Commonwealth would support special legislation at a national level given that there are a number of companies and other entities in the group which are resident or have their operations in other States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, other than New South Wales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the important point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has responded indicating that it would not support such legislation unless it was satisfied first, that there had been a conclusive judicial finding of misleading or fraudulent conduct on the part of the promoters of the scheme, and secondly, that no other lawful course was available to gain access for defrauded investors to the unlawfully obtained gains obtained by those who perpetrated the fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of Commonwealth support for special legislation at a national level and uncertainty as to whether the support of other State and Territory jurisdictions would be forthcoming, it is clear that national legislation is not available as an option to assist the investors.</PARA>
<PARA>Without the support of federal legislation, it would really be quite fruitless for the New South Wales government to seek to do it alone. The letter concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complexity of the Group's affairs and the means by which special legislation may assist investors have been exhaustively reviewed by the Attorney General.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the New South Wales Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, for the reasons outlined above, it is not clear that special legislation enacted by this state&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, New South Wales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be effective in assisting investors.</PARA>
<PARA>The federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has in effect said of that $1.2 million plus sitting in a trust fund that he will not assist these investors until, in effect, they have spent that money or until there has been a `conclusive judicial finding of misleading or fraudulent conduct on the part of the promoters of the scheme'. We have two volumes from the Australian Securities Commission that go into the dealings of this web of intrigue, chapter and verse, and it comes out with the conclusions I referred to in the earlier part of my speech. One wonders what more proof the federal Attorney-General would require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the findings of Mr Justice Powell in the New South Wales Supreme Court when the company was being wound up, which were in fact reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 14 May 1989. His honour made a number of comments about the conduct. The ASC in fact agreed with Mr Justice Powell's findings about the fraudulent conduct that had taken place in relation to the Percheron group of companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time remaining to me, let me urge the federal Attorney-General to revisit this issue. This is an issue that goes beyond party politics: this goes to the hearts and souls of 17,000 Australians who have invested their money in good faith. Given the advice of the official receiver for the companies that special legislation is required, I would urge the federal Attorney to revisit and to look at special legislation to protect the interests of those who invested their money in good faith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today in the matters of public interest debate on behalf of a company in Queensland which I believe is suffering from a very unfair imposition of sales tax. Its competitors do not have the same imposition on them. The name of the company is Poly Recyclers Pty Ltd, which operates from a factory in Brendale in Queensland. It manufactures a soil retention device, a continuous garden edge, which is called `Enviroedge'. It is made from 100 per cent `mixed post-consumer plastic waste'; in other words, it is made from recycled waste plastic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal of this firm, Tony Messina, is somebody who has invested considerable amounts of his own money&mdash;to the extent of mortgaging his own home&mdash;in developing this product, which I believe has social, environmental and economic benefits to this country. He has become very frustrated at being unable to get a response to his many requests to the Australian Taxation Office, through various government ministers and members, and also to a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), some of which I want to place on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem he has with his product is that many other kinds of garden edging, made from concrete or timber or plastic which is not recycled waste plastic, do not attract the 21 per cent sales tax which his product does attract. The irony of this situation is that Mr Messina has used his considerable experience in the plastics industry to develop a unique product. I will read part of the letter which he wrote to the Prime Minister, as that may help the Senate to understand the concerns which Mr Messina has. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past fourteen months . . . I have been experiencing untold frustration in my ongoing battle in relation to what I, and many others&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I include myself amongst those&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">regard as a very unfair tax on my new invention, ENVIROEDGE, a soil retention device which is manufactured from 100% mixed post consumer plastic waste.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Messina writes of his own experience, and I think it is worth while for the Senate to hear just what it is he is contributing to this product. He writes to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in the plastics industry since 1979 and am therefore quite knowledgeable where plastics are concerned. I know that plastics cannot be mixed when recycling to make similar products. Mainly for this reason it is claimed that plastics cannot be recycled. However, since 1989 I have been experimenting with plastics and have mastered a technique whereby all types of plastics can be combined, thus achieving a breakthrough which is a first in Australia and very possibly in the world. My revolutionary product, ENVIROEDGE, is proof of this, and there are many more products which can also be made, but which for now have had to be put on hold. I am able to do something with the one million tonnes of plastics presently ending up in landfill across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate can understand that here is somebody who has invested his own expertise, his own money, his own time, his energy, and certainly large amounts of frustration, in trying to compete in the marketplace&mdash;not with any advantage, but simply on a level playing field. He wrote to the Prime Minister in terms of his frustration as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always regarded Australia as a level playing field. However I am sadly disillusioned in this case. I have had to mortgage my own home on this project. I have received no incentives from any government scheme. My banks&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I will not name them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are ready to pull the plug on me if I don't repay my commitments to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What Mr Messina is asking for is not any kind of special treatment but simply equal treatment. He lists a large number of other products which are available free of sales tax through many distributors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sighted correspondence and other communications from some of the large chain stores, who point out to Mr Messina that his product is obviously a very good one and they would like to stock it but the main stumbling block is the fact that his product attracts a sales tax imposition of 21 per cent whilst other garden edging made from timber, concrete or plastic which is not recycled does not attract the same sales tax penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that here is an Australian company which is seeking to do something about one of the most serious environmental pollutions that there is&mdash;waste plastic&mdash;and is contributing therefore to the environmental health of Australia, is seeking to create jobs and is offering a product which brings economic and social benefit, yet the manufacturer is being prejudiced in his ability simply to sell the product because of what seems to be a most unfair imposition of sales tax. It seems that government members such as Arch Bevis and Michael Lavarch agree with Mr Messina and with me, but we have not been able to get any movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that it would be good to place before the Senate the plight of this company regarding its product.

But we need to look at some of the examples of biases which still exist more than 10 years after sex discrimination legislation came into force. They include limited pay and promotion opportunities, risks to health and safety, and limited over-award and overtime payments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparisons of male and female executive earnings also indicate the top 25 per cent of male executives earn in excess of $700,000 per year, while the women earning above that amount can be counted on one hand. In addition, the top 20 public servants, all male, earn between $500,000 and $137,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are very poorly represented in the Australian Public Service. That is where this government has had responsibility for far too long: 12 years and there is only one woman who heads a department and that is the Department of Tourism. At the very top levels of the Public Service, the percentage of female senior executive service officers ranges from 13 per cent to just three per cent of the total. There seems to be an unspoken expectation that women will not reach the highest levels in the public or private sectors and, as such, they are not granted access to essential training opportunities which might facilitate their further promotion. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, women are simply not being groomed for stardom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government once again talks long and loud about the fact that it has training programs for everyone under the sun, yet the government is failing women all over Australia. The government is simply not delivering the training and the mechanisms for women to succeed in an equal world. In the corporate sector, women managers comprise approximately 12 per cent of all managers. Even then, they are more likely to be called controllers or supervisors than to be given the more prestigious title of manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also appear that women have to choose between family and career, with most Australian female managers being single or divorced. As many as two-thirds of those women who have made it to the top have no children. Women comprise approximately 20 per cent of local government councillors, and there are a number of reasons for that. For example, women can stay closer to home and there is more time flexibility; in other words, women are more able to negotiate their own deals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representation by women in trade unions is very poor. Why has this Labor government not done something about that situation? By and large, the government is a captive of the trade unions, yet it does not seek to have more women promoted through the system. When you consider how far women still have to come in areas like maternity leave&mdash;according to the ACTU's assistant secretary, Jennie George&mdash;I would have thought that something would be done. Jennie George does not do anything; she just talks about it. There is a very wide gap between the rhetoric and the reality. Approximately 10 per cent of trade union positions are held by women. I would not have thought that Jennie George would consider that to be acceptable, but she seems to accept it; it comes from the Labor Party and the ACTU, so it is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Award restructuring is desperately needed and should include aspects such as employer sponsored child care for workers with family responsibilities. This situation affects many people in the work force, and there has to be wide discussion within the community and here in the parliament. Businesses, for example, are suffering costs left, right and centre; costs that they can no longer afford. How do we cope with this requirement that is so badly needed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-five per cent of full-time lawyers are female, and, of part-time lawyers, 54 per cent are female, but more men are employed as barristers and partners than women. In the field of accountancy, there is a downturn in the number of female managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Sex Discrimination Act, the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act and the Public Service Reform Act, the government is still unable to close the gender gap. In reality, the government has done very little. On Monday the government announced that a special team is to be established to investigate the reason why women are not making it to the top. Is that not fantastic? Let us have another inquiry, and by the time the next election comes, the government can say that there has been an inquiry to find out why women have not been successful. The investigation by a special team is another wallpapering exercise to paper over the cracks, with the government hoping to high heaven that women will not notice its inactivity. It should thrill women no end to know that the government is having another inquiry to solve all their problems. In reality, this government continues to ignore the plight of so many women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my remarks by noting that, amongst the documents tabled today, is a quality of service bulletin from Austel which reviews the performances of Telstra and Optus. I will highlight a couple of things in that bulletin because they are relevant to the matter of public interest that I will be talking about today. The bulletin refers to quality of service. In the heading of the bulletin it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proportion of faults cleared by Telstra within one or two days of notification remains stable at the national level, but declined for metropolitan customers whilst improving for country customers. Telstra's performance in answering calls to service difficulties continued to improve over the September 1994 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the bulletin is information about the restoration of service and service difficulties, and it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decline in Telstra's fault clearance performance, noted in the previous quality of service bulletins, appears to have been slowed, with national results showing a stable performance over the September 1994 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, it talks about the restoration of service and service difficulties. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decline in Telstra's fault clearance performance noted in the previous quality of service bulletins appears to have been slowed, with national results showing a stable performance over the September 1994 quarter. However, metropolitan business and residential customers continued to experience a declining level of service, particularly when compared to the September 1993 quarter results. This is a matter of concern.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Country customers experienced a slight improvement over the quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to see Austel try to explain this improvement to constituents of mine&mdash;Anthony Honner and his wife, Sue. They own a motel at Stansbury on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, along with other businesses that they have. For nine years, they have had a long running saga of service difficulties with Telstra. For nine years with the one business they have had problems with the telephone service that was supplied to their motel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a bundle of documents and letters that have been sent to me by Mr Honner. There are a couple of letters from 1986 but all the other letters were written during 1994. There were some 14 letters from Mr Honner to Telecom over that period of 12 months and 15 replies from Telecom to Mr Honner and still he did not get any satisfaction or correct treatment from Telecom with regard to the service difficulties that he was experiencing at his motel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It culminated at the end of the year with Mr Honner writing to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Michael Lee. I think it is only right that I should quote some parts of that letter because it highlights the sorts of difficulties that Mr Honner had. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached exchange of letters between Telecom and myself, as owner of the Stansbury Holiday Motel, is but a short chapter in a long running saga with Telecom. The managers of our motel have thousands of pages of Telecom files and we have volumes of evidence to prove that we have been deceived by Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to explain how his problems are synonymous  with the CoT cases&mdash;the casualties of Telecom. I will not go into detail on that. Further on in his letter to Mr Lee, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite a denial over nine years that a replacement of the old ARK exchange would solve our problems, and that operator error and quickly fixed faults were the cause, we find that with that replacement in October&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the replacement of the exchange&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that our phone suddenly works and our motel occupancy reflects the good news.</PARA>
<PARA>So after nine years of denial by Telecom, we find that with the replacement of the exchange all of a sudden his faults are fixed and the phone suddenly works. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As our telephone problems now appear to be solved, it is with respect to other Australians suffering the frustrations that we went through that I respectfully ask you to move to conduct a Senate inquiry into Telecom. There are no doubt many areas a Senate inquiry would want to look at but the evidence we could supply would relate to abhorrent customer relations, misleading information, monopolistic policies, document fabrication of the truth, denials of fact and an inability to admit to a fault which might be legally clever but which is morally wrong and most un-Australian. I am sure that the major benefits of an inquiry would be the identification of a structure in which a customer with a problem must navigate through a maze of managers in ascending order from state to state, department to department, each of which is insulated from the next, eventually reaching the manager of major disputes. No one in this line of command&mdash;including the manager of major disputes&mdash;is able to make a decision. Should one contact the general manager, he drops the customer back into the same category of management which still cannot make a decision. It is very much like a game of snakes and ladders. We had to deal with so many different Telecom personnel where the last one on the scene had no knowledge of the original problem or what their predecessors had done, and the repetitious nature of that work was a huge cost to Telecom which was ultimately borne by the subscribers and caused enormous disruption to our business.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a stark example of some of the problems that are being experienced by some consumers. In this particular case, after a period of nine years, but more particularly throughout the whole of 1994, this one consumer had difficulties which made it very difficult for his business to operate. In one of the letters he quotes how the occupancy rate of his motel dropped from 73 per cent to 38 per cent, much of which he said could be attributed to the difficulties that were experienced through their telephone exchange. He concludes his letter to Mr Lee by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecom has not responded appropriately to its critics or its legitimately dissatisfied customers. It is very evident that they make token gestures of compliance with the Austel guidelines to keep faith at the top. What they do not do is resolve problems at consumer level. For nine years, our Stansbury Holiday Motel was plagued by problems Telecom refused to even acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have read through the details of the correspondence that Mr Honner has sent to me which consists of some 30 letters over that period of time. It is fair to say, if you were to read them in detail, that you can understand the frustrations that an ordinary businessman, or an ordinary consumer of Telecom, would find when they try to solve the problems that are confronting them, whether it be in a business or a private situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the quality of service bulletin where people talk about one and two-day service and clearance difficulties, I guess that is the case. It is quite possible that the service record is very good for private consumers with only small problems which can be treated very quickly&mdash;power supplies and other minor matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the people who rely totally on Telecom&mdash;or Telstra as it is now&mdash;for the survival, smooth running and ultimate success of their business, maybe it is time that some of these issues, such as Mr Honner's, are highlighted here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Because of the very nature of the casualties, particularly of Telecom cases which have been going on for some time and are still going on, it is time that the Senate, and particularly the minister for communications whose responsibility it ultimately is, look seriously at these problems and give the answers that so many consumers throughout Australia require to the problems and difficulties that they are experiencing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today on what I regard as a matter of public interest. It is to do with the Aboriginal reconciliation process in Australia. I picked up my copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> at the local newsagent in Subiaco on Saturday morning, went home and, as I do if I get the chance, sat outside and read it. I was very disturbed&mdash;in fact it ruined my Saturday morning&mdash;when I read an article by Christopher Dore headlined `Keating attacks Coalition "racism" `. It is a disturbing aspect of the debate on issues relating to indigenous Australians that, basically, if you agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) you are not a racist and you are pro-Aboriginal; if you choose to differ with the Prime Minister or his minister, or indeed on some occasions with the chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, you are regarded as un-Aboriginal, un-Australian and against the process of reconciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to create a process, as all of us agreed when we passed the bill to support the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and if we are to create a reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the rest of the Australian community, then what is happening with the debate on Aboriginal issues in this parliament in particular, as it is reported in the media, importantly, is something that will militate against a reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always strongly held the view&mdash;which was aptly put by our former leader Dr John Hewson in his letter to the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, when the reconciliation process was being established&mdash;that reconciliation can really take place only at a community level and even at a micro-community level between individuals, as individuals come to terms with the views of their black brothers and sisters, if they are Australians of European or other ethnic descent, or, if they are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australians, with their own views in relation to their history, how they relate to Australia as a nation, how they relate to their local community. These are things that emerge within the hearts and the minds of the individuals concerned. They become part of the community, and they ultimately become part of the greater community and the greater Australian civilisation. That, for me&mdash;in my own, probably inarticulate, way of putting it&mdash;is what reconciliation means. We all become part of the so-called process in our own ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Prime Minister who, last Tuesday, I think it was, in debating the second model of his land fund bill, held out a hand of bipartisanship to our leader, John Howard, and said, `We hope that you will support the government's mark 2 bill and that you will encourage your Senate colleagues to pass it as well.' When, two days later, Mr Howard spoke as he did&mdash;for a whole range of reasons, which do not need to be canvassed in this matter of public interest debate because they will be canvassed when the bill comes back to the Senate tomorrow or in the near future&mdash;Mr Keating chose, because he did not get what he wanted, a political device, to go feral. As deputy Liberal leader Peter Costello said recently, Mr Keating's going over the top, his going feral, his spates of that which he is well known for, seem to be getting closer and closer together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my Saturday morning, drinking my cup of coffee and reading the paper. An article reported Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, as speaking at the launch of the Canberra by-election campaign on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a stinging attack on Mr Howard and the Coalition, he accused the Opposition of "deeply seated prejudice against (blacks)" . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One of the things we did here yesterday was to pay tribute to our late colleague Senator Olive Zakharov, someone who speaker after speaker said was respected for the way that she in particular was able to carry on debate, carry on the most rigorous arguments. Often, as some of my colleagues and colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, Senator Zakharov came from the Left perspective and other colleagues came from the Right, yet she could always carry on debate based on the policy, based on the ideas, without rancour, without name calling, without accusing people or impugning their integrity or how they get to their views&mdash;in other words, with respect for other people's views, respect for other people's ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ideas do ultimately shift nations; ideas do ultimately shift civilisations. It is people who come to public life, more often than not, who are at the forefront of creating ideas, creating public policy and moving nations. That is one of our roles and some are very effective at it. But may I say that, when it comes to dealing with Aboriginal affairs policy in particular and reconciliation more broadly&mdash;firstly, achieving good policy and, secondly, achieving what is ultimately more important, that is, a building of nationhood, a building of reconciliation between black and white Australians&mdash;the sorts of remarks made by Mr Keating do nothing to solve that. There does need to be a respect in politics for differing views between opposing groups, for opposing sets of ideas on Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely outrageous to suggest that, in such a complex area where there are such huge challenges to overcome, the government or ATSIC could propose a policy solution and say that it is the final word. If people do not agree with it, they are called racist or anti-black or, as the Prime Minister says, they have deeply seated prejudice against blacks. Most Australians know that is just simply untrue and they share my view that it is very unfair. I have already said that it does little to help the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here to work as the political leaders of our nation. The people have chosen us to represent them in the houses of parliament in Canberra, along with our colleagues in the state parliaments. I understand that every state parliament passed the resolutions about the need for reconciliation unanimously. If we are to proceed with any sort of unity of purpose, we have to work very hard to ensure that we do not fall for the trap of calling each other names and creating unnecessary and harmful division at the political level. We need to have vigorous debate about the myriad problems that almost seem intractable: how we legislate to solve these problems; how we act to solve problems; how we work with the states; how we work with local government; how we work with ATSIC; how we work with other Aboriginal organisations; how we solve the fundamental health problems that beset so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians; and how we solve education problems. The whole process is not helped by name calling or by the vicious racist, in fact, McCarthyist slurs, mostly dished out by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have that sort of vigorous debate. We actually had it here during the committee stage of the debate on the land fund bill in the Senate. There was a very strong debate, mostly about the principles, the practice and its workability, and the government had very strong views on it. Senator Evans put those views most eloquently. I choose to disagree with many of his views, but the coalition actually accommodated some of the views. We put up amendments. The government said it did not like them. We sought a compromise: the very last amendment in relation specifically to finding out whether native title exists before land is purchased was a classic example of that. It was a massively contentious amendment but I demonstrate the point that, where there is rational, sound debate, where people do not call each other racists, or whatever, a way can be found through these things and hopefully we can come up with better public policy than we have had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came to Canberra from Perth this week with the intention of saying that what Mr Keating has done is very wrong. It is not in the interests of anybody; it is not even in his own interests. It is not good for Australia to have a Prime Minister who will accuse his political rivals. In fact, these people may not even be his political rivals. He accuses anyone who chooses to disagree with his view on an issue: he calls them a racist and accuses them of having a deeply seated prejudice against blacks. Mr Keating, in his own heart, must know that is not true of the coalition. It is not true of any member of the Liberal or National Party; it is simply not true of one person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope my remarks will improve the level of debate and create more respect. I genuinely respect the views of many of my Labor colleagues on the other side of the House, such as Margaret Reynolds, Senator Cooney and the minister himself on some occasions, although I do not want to go over the top. There is a whole range of people on the other side whose views are genuine. They think their policies will help to improve the lot of Aboriginal people. I hope they are right. I think they are wrong, but I do have a genuine respect for those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I was horrified this morning when I tuned in to the House of Representatives to listen to the land fund debate, while I was in my office having a cup of coffee. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) serves with me on the Joint Committee on Native Title. He has strong views on these issues and I genuinely respect his views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Latham rose in the chamber to talk about the land fund bill but he basically spent most of his speech hurling insults at the coalition. Again, it did not really help the public policy debate, and it did not go to the guts of the amendments that we have moved or our motivations for moving them. During that debate he referred to me, and I will quote his comments, which he was forced to withdraw, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> green. The member for Werriwa said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, the truth of the matter was made known by Senator Campbell, the Chair of the Senate committee, one of the patronising Western Australian rednecks in the parliament, a genuine barbarian when one examines his views&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Latham was asked by the Speaker to withdraw those remarks and I am happy to say that he did. I invite Mr Latham, the member for Werriwa, to examine my views. I invite him to examine everything that I have said, from the day that I got involved in public life in the late 1970s or early 1980s, on Aboriginal affairs policy. Let him examine the thousands of pages of transcript that have been produced as a result of my chairing that Senate select committee. I had a lot to do with drafting Aboriginal affairs policy in Western Australia, as the chairman of the policy committee of the Western Australian Liberal Party. Let him examine my involvement in Aboriginal affairs over the last 15 years that I have been involved in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Mr Latham to go through all of those public documents, to look at my views and to say, `Yes, Senator Campbell disagrees with me.' When he analyses my remarks, he will see that I also have a deep commitment to achieving a better life, more hope for and reconciliation with Aboriginal people. Mr Latham is a member of the New South Wales Labor Right, which is not noted for its compassion about anything except winning. I guess he would say that about the right wing of the Western Australian Liberal Party, so we might be in the same boat there. However, I suspect that both Mr Latham and I are committed to very similar outcomes. We just differ on how we get there. We are probably also both very committed to winning the next election but I am sure that when it comes to Aboriginal affairs there is that commitment. I ask quite seriously, quite genuinely, that we put aside this unhelpful name-calling. Mr Latham knows that we are not racists. He knows that we are not barbarians and I invite him to assess my public utterances on these matters going back 15 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to raise some specific issues that require obvious review within the Department of Employment, Education and Training in the Northern Territory. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Territorian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 5 March there is an article entitled `Jobless walk out of atomic war game.' Under the heading `Training course kills off people', it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group of the Territory's long-term unemployed were given the job of deciding who should be killed off after a nuclear war as part of their training for work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The course was sponsored by the Federal Government's Department of Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on the article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gave participants the task of deciding who of 15 tourists sheltered underground at Coober Pedy in South Australia should be allowed to live after the holocaust.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourists were listed as including a mentally-handicapped Jewish child who enjoys his pets, aborigines and a beautiful Irish catholic waitress from a dubious background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a Vietnamese woman who grew up in the Vietnam War in a ghetto, a catholic priest, an Australian nun and a trainee nurse from New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another exercise made the jobless deal with a hypothetical crash landing on the moon.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular article then goes on to highlight the concerns of the three remaining participants in that course who, in order to comply with their course criteria under their entitlements to newstart, jobsearch or formal training and to receive their allowances, were under a threat that those very allowances would be suspended if they did not attend the course. I am surprised at the comments by the northern Australia manager for DEET, Elizabeth Tchacos, who defended the course. The newspaper article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was designed to help the long-term unemployed develop their social and inter-personal skills and the figure showed it was a success, she said.</PARA>
<PARA>How can it be a success when the only three remaining participants were the very three course participants who went to the newspaper and described it as a degrading and demoralising course in which to participate? Very obviously, this course needs to be thoroughly investigated, both as to its cost and effectiveness, and with regard to the aspirations of the participants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also highlight another case that has been brought to my attention by a constituent in the Northern Territory. It relates to a course that was carried out during the Christmas vacation period: an advanced word processing course set up by CES. The constituent who wrote to me described this particular course as one that was run for six weeks full-time for eight hours per day. My constituent went on to list a whole series of grievances with the course: the non-attendance of lecturers, students being more knowledgeable than lecturers in a competency based computer course, lack of availability of material, the relevance of the material provided, and assessment on topics not covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to the material that was supplied to me and I looked at the statement of attainment. It was put out over the imprimatur of the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training, with the official government stamp, with the date, with the signatures of both the course tutor and the course coordinator, certifying that my constituent had successfully completed six weeks of an advanced word processing course at the Northern Territory University. My constituent complained about all these various issues that I mentioned. He complained about the fact that for the first two weeks the literature had not arrived, and about how the literature was extremely out of date when it did arrive and, to quote him, `we were told to virtually ignore it because of this reason'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And this is important: there was an assessment record that was required to be signed off daily with the candidate's signature and the assessor's signature, with an assessment given and a description of the method of assessment. The certificate was issued despite a number of the various courses not being fully participated in. My constituent has written across the top of one page, `I did not complete the highlighted competencies for which I have been assessed.' When we look at three specific competencies, we find that the first is `phone for an interview': method of assessment, observation; assessment, C; assessor's signature given, but candidate's signature not there. The second one was `attend a job interview': method of assessment, observation; assessment, C; assessor's signature, but no candidate's signature for participation. Thirdly, there was `handle a rejection for a job hunt': method of assessment, observation; assessment, C; assessor's signature, but none for the candidate's participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that disgraceful, and I find it an issue that obviously needs to be looked at in detail. I call on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Warren Snowdon, who happens to be the federal member for the Northern Territory and who happens to push these courses in the Northern Territory, to review the relevance of these training courses. Come the next estimates committee I will certainly be asking questions about the number of courses run, about the costs that they have incurred, about the consultants that have been appointed and their qualifications, and about the number of students that have been required to participate in a repeat situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The atomic war course, which asked the jobless to decide who should be killed off after a nuclear war, absolutely staggers me. I  find that strangely ironic, given Mr Snowdon's credentials as coming from the Socialist Left of the Labor Party, with a strong commitment to the anti-nuclear area. The area that I have highlighted from the constituent who wrote to me was with regard to a Hospitality Horizons course. That constituent describes it in the letter to me as, and I quote his words, `As far as I am concerned this course was a total farce'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights the concern that many people would have about the relevance of these courses. I do not think the department can hide behind anything in these areas. I wrote to the director of the department in Darwin on 24 February, with the complaint that I had received. I have not to date received any acknowledgment nor reply to the problems and the issues that were raised in that area. When a Labor government participates through DEET in offering these sorts of courses, it is time we looked carefully at the outcomes of the various courses of this nature that are run, to see whether they are just mickey mouse courses that do nothing but keep people engaged in activities rather than containing relevance that can help them get out of the dilemma of being long-term unemployed. </PARA>

He says, `The Trade Practices Act was designed to limit concentration of ownership of any particular market, but newspapers and television have not been regarded as separate markets, so Mr Packer would effectively be treated as a new player in the newspaper market.' In other words, there is no substance whatever to the suggestion that the Trade Practices Act could possibly address the policy matter that Mr Howard says he is hanging his hat on.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear an interjection from across the chamber that `this should not take long'. I am very pleased to say that is wrong; it will take quite a long time. In the time allowed, I will not be able to run through the achievements for women over the last 20 years, and in particular the achievements for women since this Labor government has come into office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest achievements of this government has been the introduction of the sex discrimination legislation in 1984 and, interestingly, in the same year, the introduction of Medicare&mdash;an extraordinarily great achievement on behalf of women because, of course, they had the problem of paying medical bills. In that same year we introduced the equal employment opportunities programs, particularly for the Public Service; and we have seen since then the establishment of the affirmative action legislation and agency to promote opportunities for women in the private sector and our tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great program that I think we should never forget is the national education program for girls in Australian schools. We have seen the number of girls participating in school to year 12 go from about 44 per cent to over 80 per cent in the brief time that that has been in existence. That, I think, is probably one of the unspoken or unrecognised great achievements, because the benefits accrued by those young women will be with them all their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had a very dramatic change in the participation of women in the work force. That, of course, is the decision that women are making in the community, and I presume that part of it stems from their much better education and better opportunities as a result of that education. We now see something like 42 per cent of women in the work force, and we have introduced a couple of changes to very much assist them. The first and most important is our child care program&mdash;the increase from 46,000 places when we came into office to about a quarter of a million places now. There is quality with the accreditation program and the places are affordable with the child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate. At the same time, under ILO convention 156, we have introduced changes in the industrial relations legislation for workers with family responsibilities&mdash;and, of course, many of those are of direct and obvious benefit to women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, indeed, the achievements for women, under this government and certainly over the last 20 years, are very significant indeed. I think it was important at lunchtime when a number of the women in caucus met with a lot of school girls to take up the challenge of reminding them not only of the remote history but also the immediate history, things that are forgotten very quickly&mdash;achievements by this government, on behalf of women, that people sometimes do not even recall because they quickly come and quickly go in the minds of many.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am delighted to have the opportunity today to put this on the record yet again. There are many other things, including domestic violence, for example, and the achievements there, that I do not have the opportunity in the time allowed to spell out in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to say in closing that last year, when I reported on the International Year of the Family and Australia's response to the United Nations, I made a proposal that out of the International Year of the Family a goal that the world, including Australia, could set itself would be that all the world's women be literate by the year 2000. We know what a change it would make to the health, the opportunities and the children of this world if women were literate. I note that many other people are calling for the same goal, including Mrs Clinton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is a challenge we should take. It is easily measurable, it is not an outrageous expense and it would make a huge difference to the lives of women&mdash;a huge difference, to be able to read, to be able to participate in the information and education, to be able to pass that literacy on to their children. The evidence is there that, if the women are literate, in one generation the world's children will be literate. It is a challenge that I intend to push. I am delighted to see more and more support coming for it. I believe that it will be an excellent outcome from this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Before Australia signed the Uruguay Round of GATT, my request for a full environmental, economic and social impact assessment of the new trade regime on Australia was dismissed. At the same time, figures of between $2.5 billion and $5 billion a year were confidently being announced as expected benefits to Australia, including over $1 billion a year in agricultural exports. Was it not misleading to omit the impact of the huge, increasing value added imports to Australia which were inevitable under the new trade arrangements and which have blown out our trade deficit by over $906 million for January this year? Has the government commissioned a full social, economic and environmental impact assessment of GATT and now APEC? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the case of Australia, the overwhelming balance of benefit in the Uruguay Round is in Australia's interests. That does not mean that there are no downsides, but the overwhelming balance of benefit is positive for Australia. That is predominantly an economic benefit. But it is true that we have to look at the wider aspects of its implication as well. There is no doubt that, to the extent that it generates extra jobs, it is a significant social benefit. To the extent that the Uruguay Round reduces agricultural subsidies and improves the efficiency with which land is used in other countries, it is in that way and others, including the establishment of a trade and environment committee under the new WTO, of environmental benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures of the benefits to Australia from the Uruguay Round are not figures that have been manufactured or concocted. The Australian analysis done, for example, by the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics is broadly unchallenged, but the international analysis by, for example, the OECD reinforces that view. They are of the same order. Certainly both say that Australia is one of the significant beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the question of Australia's reductions in tariffs, Senator Margetts on several occasions has laboured under the misapprehension that Australia has reduced its tariff because the Uruguay Round required us to. That is not the case. It never was the case. Nobody but her ever thought it was the case. Australia made unilateral decisions to reduce  its tariffs as a matter of domestic economic policy. That was passed before the outcome of the Uruguay Round was known and is more than sufficient to meet all the requirements the Uruguay Round imposed upon us in terms of the big changes. We made three or four specific changes that went through with the legislative package with regard to orange juice. In relation to dairy, we made a commitment that we would put an equal support arrangement in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the big changes in relation to import regulation in Australia, import barriers in Australia, the removal of quotas and the reduction in tariffs were decisions made&mdash;Senator Margetts is entitled to disagree with them&mdash;but they were not Uruguay Round driven changes. They were domestic economic policy driven changes, which I support and which I think are being reflected in significantly enhanced efficiency and competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is a matter for debate. Senator Margetts has a different view, which of course she is entitled to have, but those changes do not relate to the Uruguay Round. If they did, I would not apologise for them because I think they are changes in Australia's national interest. People have to realise that the importers are Australians too. The people who are buying the products and who say, `These are the products I want at the price I want to pay for them,' are Australians. The beneficiaries of these imports, including the people who are getting jobs putting in place the capital equipment that is coming in, are Australians. The people in the factories and on the farms using those products at cheaper prices are Australians. The people getting the benefit of lower prices for clothing are Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who advocate high tariffs are nearly always the same people who are anti-indirect taxes, and tariffs are as regressive an indirect tax as you can find. They are in many ways more iniquitous than the GST.

I refer the minister to the latest national survey of business expectations by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which once again demonstrates the failure of both the government and the minister to provide any real support for small business in this country. Is the minister aware that the survey has revealed that the federal government's measures to slow the economy have had a regressive effect on small business? In fact, two-thirds of small businesses do not expect conditions to improve. Why has the minister failed to implement measures to protect small business from the regressively high interest rates of the Treasurer, Mr Willis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought my remarks were quite pertinent because of the lack of interest by Liberal senators. However, I point out to Senator Calvert that only last Friday we had a meeting of the National Small Business Forum, which represents over 30 organisations of small business and industry groups in Australia. At that forum, we had an hour's discussion with the Treasurer about issues such as interest rates, fiscal matters in the budget, the FBT and a range of other issues which small business is interested in. It was a very open discussion. We also dealt with issues such as franchising and so on. All of those discussions were very constructive. As a result, we were able to take up a number of issues, as we have in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert should recognise the work of those small business organisations; there is a very constructive atmosphere. At the end of last year the National Institute of Accountants raised with me its concerns about interest rates and their impact on small business. As a result I asked the institute to conduct a survey of its members. That survey was published in January of this year. It showed that the accountancy members who were surveyed, representing about 80,000 small business accounts, had a genuine concern about future rises in interest rates. I discussed that matter with both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and those issues are obviously going to be discussed in the budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also at the discussion last Friday the Treasurer made it very clear that we do not want to raise interest rates to any level above what is absolutely necessary. He also pointed out that if you do not want to raise interest rates, you have to look at fiscal measures, and that includes the cutting of government expenditure and tax matters, without committing the government to any particular outcome. He made it very clear to the small business community that its interest in maintaining interest rates at the lowest possible level will require other action by the government. That was accepted by the members of the small business groups present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Calvert that this government has a very close working relationship with the Small Business Forum in Australia and has a very close dialogue with those organisations, which are not interested in the ideological baggage or warfare that senators opposite may want to go on about. Small business wants a specific working relationship with the government where it can raise issues of concern and where we deal with them in a practical and open manner. As a result, we get good outcomes. The Small Business Forum is now acting as the major conduit of information to the government on small business issues. One thing is for certain: Liberal senators opposite have no idea, not a clue, about the practical workings of small business. I suspect it will be another two years before a Liberal senator asks a question on small business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator McMullan has already answered a question recently on this subject. I repeat for the record: there is no change in Australia's basic position, which is one of unequivocal support for multilateral trade liberalisation on a global basis, with anything we do in APEC by way of trade liberalisation agenda matters contributing to that larger objective. It is absolutely the last thing on our minds, and always has been since APEC was formed, that it should constitute any kind of trade block engaged in either defensive or offensive trade war with other countries or other groupings, like the European Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument, of course, as to how best the Bogor objectives might actually be achieved&mdash;whether it is best done by way of simple unilateral liberalisation on an MFN basis, with or without some associated process of negotiation, or whether rather that longer term objective, and global trade liberalisation, might best be achieved by building up on a sequence of preferential trade agreements, perhaps using existing building blocks that already operate in this way within the APEC region. Australia has not excluded the possibility of that being a way towards reaching the larger objective, but our preference is&mdash;I think it is probably fair to say, and as the Prime Minister has recently said&mdash;for an approach which does not in any way compromise, even in a transient basis, the MFN principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say, though, so that it is clearly understood, that the notion of getting to the larger objectives on a free trade agreement route would necessarily have to be consistent with GATT article 24&mdash;it could not be put in place otherwise&mdash;and it would need to be a free trade agreement with a difference. It could not just be the kind of preferential model we have had in the past, unaccompanied by any simultaneous commitment to unilateral liberalisation as against the rest of the world, because to go down that particular path would be to be erecting, arguably, defensive barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only basis on which I think you could justify it would be as an interim measure designed essentially to exercise some obvious leverage against other trading nations outside APEC in order to get them to participate in a full international round. I think there is a very strong case in fact to be made for proceeding earlier rather than later to a new WTO GATT round on a universal basis as the best way of squaring all these circles and meeting our various objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may be an unrealistic objective in the short to medium term, but it is certainly an objective that we should retain in the longer term. I think in practice the way forward is not likely to prove to be through that FTA mechanism, qualified as I have described, but rather through some more obviously and consistently MFN oriented position; but I do not think anything that we are doing as these negotiations proceed should be seen as, in any way, compromising on the fundamental principles to which we have been committed from the outset.</PARA>

As from late May 1994, in the case of the Lodge, and 1 July 1994, in the case of Kirribilli House, all casual staff have been employed under contract and paid through the department's salary system which picks up, as you would expect, the tax and superannuation aspects. The department since that time has been meeting its statutory obligations in relation to casual employees at the Lodge and Kirribilli House.</PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to Senator Panizza's question. Up to 31 December 1994, one of the grounds for independent status for the purposes of Austudy was marriage. This criteria contravened the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as it discriminated against those students who were in a de facto relationship and those who were single. However, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner had granted an exemption from the provisions of the SDA until the regulations could be amended, and no later than 31 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decided to amend the regulations to bring the scheme into compliance with the Sex Discrimination Act by removing marriage as a ground for independence. This was done by the making of regulations on 6 December 1994 to come into effect on 1 January 1995. On 9 February 1995, the Senate passed a motion disallowing the regulations tabled by the government to bring the Austudy regulations into conformity with the Sex Discrimination Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate's action also removed the regulation which provided for the preservation of independent status for those students previously granted independence on the grounds of marriage. In moving to disallow the amending regulations, the Senate understood that the 1994 Austudy regulations would be revived, thereby re-establishing marriage as a ground for independent status for the estimated 2,200 students affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that the disallowance has not achieved this effect, because the Austudy regulations are still inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act. The effect of such inconsistency is that section 26 of the Sex Discrimination Act renders inoperative the revived regulations, and the Austudy scheme should be administered on and from 9 February 1995 by disregarding the revived regulations. Therefore, notwithstanding the carriage of the disallowance, students under 22 years of age who subsequently apply for Austudy cannot be granted independent status solely on the basis of being, or previously having been, married.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Across the Public Service only 16 per cent of SES jobs are occupied by women. Women account for 48 per cent of permanent APS staff, but the proportion of women in administrative senior officer positions and in senior executive streams decreases as the classification increases. No wonder the minister did not put anything about this in her answer. The government has had 12 years to do something about it and it has done very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the minister talk about the government's record in superannuation? No. Why not? Because, as far as women in superannuation go, its record is appalling&mdash;appalling. It was the coalition who first put into its policies the idea that women who go in and out of the work force ought to have a retirement savings account. Who stole that idea? The Labor Party, but it only gave that to them for two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else has this government done? It has done nothing about dealing with superannuation and with the way it is dealt with in divorce. The government has put that in the too-hard basket too. So it has not dealt with the issue of superannuation or with the fact that women go in and out of the work force and have problems with superannuation. Now, with compulsory superannuation, many women are facing the fact that administrative costs chew up most of their superannuation. So that is the government's record on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else did Senator Crowley not talk about? She did not talk about the carers. They are mostly women, thousands upon thousands of women, day in and day out&mdash;and I think once before in this chamber I said this&mdash;who labour for 26 hours a day&mdash;and I ask <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> not to change that this time to 24 hours, as it did last time&mdash;looking after people, in particular those with dementia but also young people and other people in families with disabilities. The vast majority of those carers receive little or no help from Labor. Current respite care arrangements are inflexible, inaccessible and inappropriate to the widely varying needs of carers. The trade union dominated industrial relations system has been painstakingly slow in recognising the dual responsibilities of many women as both unpaid carers and valuable members of the work force. Senator Crowley did not talk about the government's record in that area either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group Senator Crowley did not talk about was rural women. She did not talk about the promise&mdash;what was it?&mdash;that there will be no new taxes before the election. What did rural women have straight after the election? They had an increase in petrol excise. That affected them getting into town, delivering their kids to school and going to after-school events and meetings.</PARA>

<PARA>First of all, I would like to thank my whip for standing aside and letting me ask the question. I was very enlightened to hear the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction say that it was the first time I had asked a question about small business in two years. I find that hard to believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was enlightened by the minister's answer. I was very pleased to find out that, after consulting small business, he found they are concerned about increases in interest rates. That was basically the answer: that after consulting with small business they are concerned about interest rates. I can enlighten him. They are concerned more about other things than interest rates. I think another thing they would be concerned about would be the wages break-out that is building up in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our leader pointed out recently, after being through `the recession that we had to have', small business&mdash;all businesses in fact&mdash;has virtually had only five minutes in the sunlight. This survey points out that one in five small businesses expect conditions to worsen over the next quarter. That is something that this government should be totally ashamed of because we know&mdash;everybody knows&mdash;that small businesses are the major employers in this country. They are the ones that employ the people. That is the reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another thing that is happening with small business. More now than at any other time in the seven years I have been in parliament small businesses are ringing my office and telling me their concerns about the economy and how their businesses are going. I had two people in my office last Friday. I have had numerous phone calls. My local paper has reported today that one of our department stores, A. J. Connor, an old family company which has been around for a long time, is in a little bit of trouble. There are other businesses, furniture businesses, which are having some trouble. When I look at the paper I can understand why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a person who has a general store that sells petrol, hires videos and has a small garden centre would be what you would class as a small business. Our local newspaper put together a list of the sorts of things that they have to put up with. Sure, a lot of these are state government impositions, but I think every state government imposes similar types of impositions on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you happen to be in that category, the state government requires you to have a verification of your weights and measures and weighing and measuring instruments. You have to have a licence to keep dangerous goods. You have to have planning approval for the construction of your shop and you have to have a licence to sell petroleum. You have to have a factory registration, a shop registration, a retail tobacconist registration and a business name registration. You have to have your hoardings and signs registered. You have to have a second-hand dealer's licence, a public vehicle licence and a rental business registration. You have to have a permit to purchase specified substances and a licence for purchase of restricted pesticides. On top of that, you need a certificate of competency and a country store medicines licence. The local government requires you to have a licence to operate food premises and food premises registration. That is just in the local area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the Commonwealth, of course, we see that on top of that the Commonwealth requires you to pay fringe benefits tax. You have to be registered as a group employer. You have to have a licence for public exhibition of music video clips, and then you have to have another licence for copyright music. You have to also have a licence for public performance of protected sound recordings. You have to have a tax file number, and you have to pay the superannuation guarantee levy. On top of that, you pay income tax, company tax, fuel tax and payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister is fair dinkum about helping small business, why doesn't he get out there and start to cut a bit of this red tape and start to help small business instead of just saying, `Look, we have been consulting with small business, and they are worried about interest rates.' They are worried about a lot more than interest rates: it is the red tape and the taxes that this government is imposing on them. </PARA>

Since his entry into the Senate, he has continued in that role of defending small business. In fact, before he came into the parliament he was a farmer, and that would have to be the very essence of small business in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that Senator Woodley should comment about Tasmania. One of the points I was going to make&mdash;and I may as well get on to it now&mdash;relates to Tasmania. The national survey of business expectations undertaken by ACCI showed that for firms with fewer than 1,000 employees&mdash;that is, amongst the overwhelming majority of firms&mdash;conditions are becoming more difficult. I say to honourable senators&mdash;and Senator Calvert and Senator Newman would know&mdash;that there are virtually no employers in Tasmania that employ more than 1,000 employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, in this survey all the businesses in Tasmania are categorised as small businesses. If we talk about companies like the zinc works at Risdon, North Broken Hill in Burnie and Gold Mines of Australia on the west coast in Queenstown, we find that they employ unless than 1,000 people. When you go through all those businesses you then find that two-thirds of them are saying, `Things are grim for us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Tasmania that unfortunately means virtually every single business enterprise is suffering. Why are they suffering? It is because of the financial incompetence of this government forcing up interest rates. I notice that the minister has come back into the chamber. He might like to tell us what the nominal interest rate is that small business has to pay on its loans and overdraft facilities. Let us see how well acquainted the minister actually is with the problems of small business&mdash;the red tape associated with putting in your employee superannuation returns and PAYE tax and all the other problems that small business has to face every single week of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, not only is small business the heart and soul of Tasmania but the whole body of Tasmania's economy. Within the total Australian economy there is no doubt that small business is the heart and soul. It might not play as major a role as it does in Tasmania, but it is by far the largest employer of people within this country. Small business is the area where there is greatest potential for growth in employment and job opportunities for the young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this government done for small business? It has increased fuel prices, it has increased taxes, it has increased the fringe benefits tax and it has increased the marginal rate of taxation for people who run their businesses without the benefit of a company structure. It is interesting to find in this survey conducted by ACCI that large businesses seem quite happy with this government because all it ever does is deal with the big businesses and trade unions and cut out the Asahis and others of this world who employ only 42 people. You do not care about small business. That is a fundamental difference between the current Labor government and the next government which, under John Howard, will ensure that there is an environment for small business to prosper. </PARA>

<PARA>I want to tell the Senate that members of the community in North Queensland, including residents of Cardwell, are still concerned about the development at Oyster Point. Last weekend members of that community planted 1,000 mangroves in an effort to regenerate the area and to protect the seagrass on which dugongs feed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned. For that reason I spent some time in Cairns during the last couple of weeks and took with me an internationally recognised marine scientist who spent a week there doing work to follow up work he has done in that area over many years on the Great Barrier Reef. His name is Dr Robert Morris, and his qualifications include a PhD and a doctorate in science. He commented on many areas of significant degradation around Cairns and on the Great Barrier Reef. In particular I want to record Dr Morris's comments about Oyster Point. In speaking about the danger of dredging in these areas, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide even a modest boat access into Oyster Point from deep water would require a channel 4m deep by 20m wide for a length of at least 800m. This would produce at least 64,000 cubic metres of dredge spoil. With the present active sedimentation, maintenance dredging could produce a further 20-30,000 cubic metres of dredge spoil annually. The greatly increased turbidity induced in the coastal waters and inshore reef areas will certainly further degrade the local marine environment, but it is the disposal of the dredge spoil which can cause the greatest damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The developer plans to use some of this dredge spoil for site filling, but most of it will be placed into spoil dumps near the coast. Water from these dredge spoil dumps will then be discharged back into the Channel. From the results of the `natural experimentation laboratory', which has been established on the east side of Trinity Inlet, each of these dredge spoil dumps on the edge of Hinchinbrook Channel, and the landfill site, could quickly become a major source of highly toxic, metal-rich acid leachates which would devastate the local marine environment of the Channel, not to mention their potential impact on the reef.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate can understand my concern in asking Senator Faulkner&mdash;I was pleased with his answer&mdash;about the incremental granting of permits to do small parts of the work which is contemplated in the channel at Oyster Point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Brownhill this day, relating to forest management.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make just a couple of very brief points, and I thank the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) for allowing the time for debate to be extended. Senator Gareth Evans said that the coupes had not been released in New South Wales because the `state government, unlike other states, simply had not provided information'. I have been in touch with the minister in New South Wales, and he has advised me that at no stage was there any request for further information or any suggestion that insufficient information was given, not at the ministerial level nor at the officer level. The minister in New South Wales had nine phone calls with Senator Collins, and Senator Collins obviously did not raise these issues. Why didn't he?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really all about jobs. In one of today's newspapers there is an article headed `Sawmill shuts in chip row'. One of the concerns is that the Commonwealth government is now trying to take over the sawlog industry. The Commonwealth government knows nothing about it, and it is trying to take it over by de facto means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that Senator Evans did not answer and I think he still needs to look at is the fact that the Glenbog and Tantawanglo state forests have already been assessed by the Commonwealth in its own inquiry, and it has been agreed that they are to be made available for logging under the south-east forests agreement, which was signed by Michael Lee and Mr Souris. Surely, if the federal government has already signed off on them, they should have been released. Why have they not been released? The government has released only a couple in New South Wales, and it is obviously doing this as a political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat this question to the minister: why were the concerns that he mentioned today omitted from the letter that Roger Beale, the Associate Secretary of PM&amp;C, wrote to the state's unions and industry. They requested more information from other states but not from New South Wales. Basically, I think it is a political stunt to try to help Mr Carr in New South Wales. The government here stands condemned for that because it is all about jobs; its about people; it is about kids; it is about people making their payments on machinery. I thank you for the extension of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by thanking Senator Coulter for his graciousness in deferring his matter of urgency until a later date. Today is International Women's Day&mdash;a day when all the world can celebrate the achievements, endeavours and contributions of women. In Australia, women have made a vast number of achievements, gradually wearing away at the establishments and the prejudices which have held them back over a great length of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these women are everyday people whose names will not be immortalised in history. They are average women who have worked hard all their lives to help themselves and others to be the very best they can be&mdash;whether it be in employment, education and general learning, sport, academia, the arts, or any other field. There are also women whose names are now synonymous with the progress, achievement and endeavour of women. I would like to take a moment to reflect on some of their achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the days of the early suffragists, Vida Goldstein, Rose Scott and Catherine Helen Spence, who fought for the recognition of women against all odds, women have certainly come a long way indeed. In the last 10 years alone we have seen many achievements. For example, we have seen a federal government department headed by a woman for the first time. Sadly, as Senator Patterson said not so long ago, there is only one federal government department headed by a woman, and that is the Department of Tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. Janine Haines was the first female leader of a federal political party. Mary Gaudron was the first woman to be appointed to the High Court of Australia. Macquarie University became the first Australian university to appoint a female vice-chancellor&mdash;in 1987. Flight Lieutenant Williams and Flying Officer Hicks became the first female pilots to graduate from the Royal Australian Air Force. The first female station leaders of the Australian national Antarctic research expeditions were appointed. Deirdre O'Connor became the first female Federal Court judge and the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other areas which are probably not so well known we have women who are presidents, national presidents of political parties and federal directors of political parties. We have women as leaders of political parties, such as Joan Sheldon and the recently elected leader of the Liberal Party here in the Australian Capital Territory, Kate Carnell, whom we hope will be made the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have female state presidents of the Liberal Party. For example, Vicki Chapman is a current one in South Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Tasmania. It is very significant that those women are playing a major part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is just a sample of those achievements. An abundance of women writers come to mind, such as the late Dame Mary Durack, Elizabeth Jolley, Kath Walker and many more. There are athletes such as Cathy Freeman, Melinda Gainsford, Kathy Watt, Shelley Taylor Smith, Nicole Bradkje, Heather McKay and Michelle Martin. The list goes on. There are women in the media. A list of those who have achieved great heights would have to include people like Michelle Grattan, Pru Goward, Ellen Fanning and Jana Wendt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entertainment industry has been very well served by the likes of Judith Durham, Kate Ceberano, Wendy Matthews, Grace Knight, Jenny Morris, Debra Conway and Dame Joan Sutherland. When it comes to leading designers, we cannot walk away from people like Judy Done, Maggie Tabberer, Carla Zampatti and Liz Davenport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much recognition can be given to women in celebration of today's International Women's Day. I regret that the progress women are making towards true equality in the public and private sectors is not moving in the leaps and bounds I would have hoped. Progress seems to have become somewhat stagnant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need look no further afield than Australia when it comes to the issue of income imbalance and other aspects of the gender gap between males and females. In Australia, the incomes of our top female executives and public servants are far apart from those of the male executive. I view this as great cause for concern. We do not even need to take the top executives into account. In fact, average weekly total earnings for full-time adult women were around 79 per cent of the earnings of their male counterparts, according to data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period August 1994 to November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing we need to look at is that, in comparing all earnings, including part-time and full-time earnings, women's income is 66 per cent of men's. In the December quarter of 1975&mdash;20 years ago&mdash;prior to the introduction of all federal equal opportunity legislation, females were earning 65 per cent of male incomes. That is only one per cent less than it is today. I believe it is therefore abundantly clear that little has changed in the past 15 to 20 years if we can improve by only one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International Women's Day 1995 is an appropriate occasion to remind the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of his 1993 promise to offer Australian women a new deal. This promise seems to be offered by the Labor Party at every election, yet the ABS figures are proving that nothing is really happening in terms of achievements in earning capacities in particular. We still hear phrases such as `stuck on the lower rungs of the corporate ladder', `the status woe' as opposed to the status quo, `glass ceilings' and others which imply that some indescribable force is actively preventing women's incomes from climbing to a level that would put them on an equal footing with their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of equal importance is the fact that these limitations hamper economic growth and productivity and inflict a certain amount of physiological and psychological damage on women as a group. There has been a spate of newspaper articles on the issue in recent times, particularly following last year's debate on the value or otherwise of installing a quota system to entice more women to seek a career in politics. It is interesting that the Labor Party started with 50 per cent, went to 40 per cent and has now lowered it to 30 per cent. It is still having difficulty with that. That purely and simply reflects the fact that it is not easy to come about and that the quota system is unfair and unjust. Many women simply do not want it, because they do not want to indulge in what will end up being reverse discrimination against men. That is what will happen with a system such as the one that was proposed last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been reported that females are more likely to be called controllers or managers as opposed to the higher status title of director. The glass ceiling closes over once women reach an income of around $40,000. Graduate entry level men receive a higher starting salary than women with similar qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 January this year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> put all of this information into a far better perspective by giving concrete examples of top male and female earnings with a report on executive women's incomes. In that report it was stated that the highest paid woman in Australia, the Haytesbury Holdings chair, Janet Holmes a Court, was earning $1 million per year and that she was closely followed by the national managing director of Nutri-Metics, Imelda Roche, on $900,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Public Service the top ten female incomes ranged from $237,000 to $800,000 for the High Court Justice to $170,000 for the Deputy Director of the New South Wales Education Department. By stark contrast, a survey of male executive salaries published by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monthly</EMPHASIS> last October listed 25 male executives whose earnings were in excess of $700,000, while a list of the top 20 public servants, all of whom were male, earned between $500,000 and $137,000. This highlights so much of what is wrong and where action has not followed the rhetoric. In the corporate sector, two studies by the ABS conducted on businesses in 1984 and 1992 showed that the number of women as a percentage of total managers rose by only one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a day on which we can certainly celebrate the achievements of many women who have achieved in spite of what has gone on around them. I still reject wholeheartedly the concept of quotas to artificially bring women into top management positions in the Public Service or the private sector, as women themselves do&mdash;because they want to get there on merit and merit alone. But it is tragic that, 15 to 20 years down the track, with much legislation brought in, women are still finding it difficult to achieve. They are the ones that we should be concentrating on to make sure that they do achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, according to this piece of paper in front of me, as a public matter of public importance we are recognising on International Women's Day the achievements and contribution of women within the community and their progress towards true equality. One might be tempted to think that this is an MPI encouraging us to acknowledge the nice achievements, the great successes. I notice that Senator Knowles nods. I have read the intent of her words. She would not, for example, like to list under the achievements and contribution the negative achievements of women&mdash;for example, the women who have committed a crime or the fact that women in this parliament are taking their place in the traditional abuse, parry and thrust of debate in here. One could say, `Women have achieved a whole lot. They have come all the way to parliaments and they are able to play the game in a tough way like anybody else; that is an achievement, I suppose.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do I take it from Senator Knowles nodding by affirmation that we are here to describe the successes and achievements which we regard as pluses&mdash;the fact that women do not now live in the kind of abject circumstances that they did 101 years ago, when women in South Australia were campaigning strongly for the family and for a political voice, a place in parliament that would enable them to argue the case for improved conditions for women and for families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come a huge distance in the last 100 years and certainly since International Women's Day started, early in the 20th century. We have also come a long way in the last 10 years. I read some of those achievements of women over the last 10 years into the record during question time today. We also have a long way to go; no-one denies that. The achievements are that we have changed the climate of our society about women. The successes of and opportunities for women are vastly more, vastly different and vastly better than they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago. I thank Senator Knowles for the litany of women she put on the record. As she says, there are many more one could contribute. I certainly believe that some of those we should acknowledge are the women's advisers, both political and community advisers, who have been appointed by government over the last 20 years or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe we can overlook the contribution of Elizabeth Reid, appointed by the Whitlam government&mdash;in particular, the tough task she had to withstand a barrage of abuse about her insufficiencies and the pointlessness of her position. I think with great courage she actually moved the climate for achievements of women well beyond `if women did it it was deviant' to `if women tried and achieved, that was a perfectly proper and appropriate way for women to behave'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also recognise the contribution of Beryl Beaurepaire, I believe appointed by Malcolm Fraser as the first national women's advisory committee adviser to the government. I believe her contribution is something that is well worthy of commendation and remark. I also say that it is a matter of despair to her and a lot of Liberal women over the years that their own Liberal parties were very slow in advancing the cause of women at anything like the pace those committed women, for example Beryl, really wanted to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I said on the record, `Women earn somewhat less than men,' people would say that that is a measure of women's failure to achieve. If I said, `Men do less housework than women,' no-one would regard that as a measure of men's failure. It may well be, indeed, that it is. It may well be that if we are progressing towards true equality we will have a time when both of those statements urge the same response of unsatisfactory measurement of moving towards true equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that one of the most important things this government has been doing, apart from its specific achievements, is moving further the clear understanding that a climate where opportunities for women and achievements by women, either government supported or community supported or individual efforts, is something the community wants to encourage. It is not any more an oddity for women to achieve in a whole lot of areas where even as recently as five or 10 years ago we had extraordinary fights and ridiculous claims about what would happen if women became pilots, came into parliament, wanted to borrow money from a bank or any of those things. There are still reports of very stupid, ignorant responses to women breaking through in all of those areas. Mostly, I think, those responses are now disparaged by the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent polling of women in Australia produced some very clear evidence that today's women recognise that there are lots of things still to be achieved, but they are very clear that their lives are much better and they are much better off than were their mothers and grandmothers. They very clearly would say, and did say, that they do not want to go back there. They do not want to live the tough lives that their mothers and grandmothers did, but they do want to, in the contemporary time, fight for achievements and goals of their own. Since I have been elected to the Senate, I have made it my business to promote orders of Australia for women and to encourage women to nominate all those silent or unrecognised women achievers in our society. If we can continue to do that, maybe we will get wider recognition of the huge achievements of women, particularly those that are not necessarily in the parliament or in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will correct some of the figures that Senator Knowles gave about women's earnings. Those figures, I think, are not quite accurate. In relation to pay equity, when the Labor government came to office in 1983 female average weekly ordinary time earnings represented 79 per cent of male earnings. In August 1994 that had changed to 84.2 per cent of men's earnings. There has been a significant improvement. To suggest that 65 per cent has become 66 per cent is another inaccuracy. I urge Senator Knowles to check those figures. They are not comparing apples with apples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a considerable increase in the earnings of women. But quite clearly, for a variety of reasons, some of which Senator Knowles alluded to&mdash;women are more often in part-time work and women are still in lower paid areas&mdash;women's earnings are not 100 per cent equal with men's. It is important that we recognise that there has been quite a significant achievement of nearly five per cent over the decade or so that the Labor government has been in office&mdash;nothing to be complacent about but certainly something to be accurate about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On International Women's Day I think it is important that we not only look at the achievements for women within Australia but also recognise the challenge for women around the world. The difficulties we face in Australia, I think, are sometimes importantly measured against the challenges for women in other countries. If, say, 500,000 women around the world die each year from childbirth and related causes, very few of those women die in Australia. Many of them die from poverty, malnutrition and neglect in Third World countries. Something like 14 million children die from easily preventable causes each year around the world. These are matters of great anguish and concern for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that on International Women's Day, when we do look at the achievements and recognise how far we have come and how the climate for women and equality between men and women, the most civilised and preferred option, has advanced very much, we must also realise that if we look beyond our borders there is still a huge challenge waiting for us, particularly on behalf of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point during question time that we could very usefully have a goal, coming out of the International Year of the Family and certainly today, that all the women in the world be literate by the year 2001. That would be a splendid achievement for women. It is not an unmanageable goal and it would certainly be of great benefit to the families around the world. It would, according to the Cairo conference, be one of the best ways to manage the world's population&mdash;a decision made between men and women equally and not unequally, as is very much the case currently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in setting an international goal like that we can address the challenges for women in Australia and at the same time embrace the challenges for all women on this International Women's Day. In particular, I recognise the importance of assisting our daughters and nieces to understand what has been achieved for them so that they can take it on from here. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we reflect on the debt we owe those women who have gone before us&mdash;women in Elizabethan England who fought to maintain their hard won independence in the face of proclamations forbidding them to meet together to babble and talk and ordering men to keep their wives in their houses; the campaigners of the 18th and 19th century who not only wanted political and educational equality for women but also spoke strongly against the domestic subjugation of women, referring to women as `abject domestic fixtures' and `domestic breeding machines'; the American Christian and Quaker women who fought against black slavery, restricting their opposition to unostentatious prayer when they realised they had another fight on their hands, in the words of one, `to fight to get our male brethren to take their feet off their necks because they were constantly being reprimanded for not doing the womanly thing'; the suffragettes; the first women trade unionists in the early part of this century; and the feminists of the 1950s and 1960s who sought to place the liberation of women in an economic context. We have made progress and to these known and unknown women we owe an enormous debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to name a list of women who have made wonderful contributions. There are so many of them and I think they are so inspiring to all of us. I thought I would talk about Australian women generally because I think their great achievement is in surviving&mdash;surviving massive social change which has seen their entry into the work force in huge numbers, has seen them have to draw on their reservoir of skills and talents to find the way to balance work and family, has seen them take on the double shift, and has seen them take the primary responsibility for maintaining social cohesion at the same time as they have taken on full-time paid work in many instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are a couple of questions that often occur to me about the future of some aspects of society and community life which are raised by the notion of the progress we are making. I often wonder, when I see the voluntary capacity of the generation of women which is my mother's, the way in which they contribute to society visiting hospitals, doing the morning teas after funerals&mdash;those sorts of things&mdash;unasked, unacknowledged, unrewarded in many senses in terms of economic contribution, what is going to happen to that aspect of social cohesion when they are not with us and when most people my age are in paid work of some kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a lot of progress, but I do not think we have challenged sufficiently that core issue, that notion of paid and unpaid work, particularly in the case of women's work in the home, and the notion of a voluntary contribution and the economic value that we should ascribe to that. Of course, that requires us to do something monumentally difficult like saying, `Excuse me, boys, you got the national accounting system wrong when you wrote those definitions all that time ago. We actually don't believe that the only things which are of economic benefit are those which are productive and for which money exchanges hands. We can recognise intuitively a whole range of other things which make a contribution and which ought to be acknowledged.' That for us, I think, is a huge challenge but it is one that we must continue to undertake. We should not just accept definitions without questioning them when we think of the context in which they were created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of the matter of public importance talk about the quest for true equality. I guess some of the signposts, if you want to look at the progress, are some comments from early suffragettes. There is one I particularly like, from a woman in the late 1800s. Men were saying that women really would not want to be too involved in politics, particularly in economics and the framing of a budget, because they might forget to put the chops on and they might bear rickety children. I cannot help but reflect with a wry smile on how 90 years later, with my having a treasury and finance portfolio, I don't even remember chops, chicken and pasta and all the rest of it. I love having an opportunity to think about budgets and other matters financial. Interestingly enough, it is in that sector that great opportunities are being opened for women. We are seeing a huge increase in the number of women who are making a career in financial planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to make some comments on women in small business. I was talking recently to a woman entrepreneur who had returned from a visit to South-East Asia, where, she reported, women surprisingly enjoy far more prominent roles in business than they do in Australia. She suggested that one contributing factor to this might be because the military has a very different role in Asian countries and men, seeking fame and fortune there, choose that route as much as business, leaving more room in business for women to prosper and grow. It is a curious thought that women prosper under military dictatorships: that is not a solution to the gender imbalance that I am putting forward. But we do need to ask why women here have not had the opportunity for the same success as men have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at small business, women now own 31 per cent of Australian small business and they are very successful in those businesses. Research by Professor Alan Williams of the University of Newcastle shows that businesses owned by women are more profitable and are profitable sooner after start-up than businesses owned by men. However, women's businesses tend to grow at a much slower rate than those of men, and there are a whole lot of reasons for that but predominantly it is access to finance&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and that is part of access to finance. But other studies show that women have superior business survival skills, that they are better managers of staff than men, that they are more flexible, that they are more able to adapt to changes in the business environment. It has been suggested, though, that women are less keen to take risks in business than men and it could be that women enter businesses for different reasons than men. Women appear to place more emphasis on security, independence and flexibility rather than raking in huge profits. If you look at the reasons why they go into business, women rank financial gain fourth, whereas men put it as the second most important reason for going into business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are still disadvantaged though because, when they arrive at the very beginning of their small business careers, they arrive with less wealth because women's incomes on average are two-thirds those of men. They have had less capacity to generate wealth, less opportunity for career advancement than men in the same age bracket, interrupted career cycles, less opportunity to amass superannuation savings, et cetera. Nevertheless, I think it is worth pointing out just how well women are doing in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of women in parliament, which has been touched on by previous speakers, I do not think it matters that we have different approaches. For the Labor Party, quotas are an approach that is totally legitimate. The opposition wants to say it should be based on merit. The Democrats say, `Okay, participatory processes have meant that we have ended up, we think, with approximately equal numbers of men and women representing Democrats in our parliaments, and we have delivered three female leaders.' I do not think it should be a matter of, `Our system works better than yours,' because we all have different starting points but we want to get to the same goal. We each have something to contribute in the solution to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But while we are making good advances in getting more women into parliament, we are not doing so well in the cabinet agenda, and that is where I want to see us doing so much better. I want women in equal numbers in cabinet having an influence on the agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, I thank Senator Knowles for giving me the opportunity to join in this debate as the only male who has either been game enough or been given the opportunity to congratulate Australian women on their achievements on this important day of celebration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because I think it is important that the achievements of women&mdash;the progress that has been made in terms of political rights and opportunities and also the economic progress&mdash;are recognised not only by women but by men as well. It is an enhancement to our nation as a whole, and I would like to see more men get on their feet and recognise these achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there have been enormous gains in economic opportunity, in political status and in respect for women as individuals, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to applaud those gains. However, I also recognise that we are still far from achieving a position of equality. Women are still disadvantaged in many areas compared with men. The government, which on occasions such as this likes to give itself credit for many of the recent achievements, should recognise the distance that still has to be covered to achieve something like true equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listening to Senator Kernot quoting from the suffragettes caused me to think for a moment that perhaps I should quote from less enlightened men of the past just to give some indication of how far society has advanced in a relativity short period of time. I reflect just briefly upon the words of the Hon. J.A. Stirling some 100 years ago in the Legislative Council in South Australia&mdash;and, of course, last year we celebrated women obtaining the franchise in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He engaged himself in the debate. He was one of those men who was somewhat uncomfortable about the prospect of women being given the vote. He said, `Giving women the vote would create family friction leading to the downfall of the family and family values and, ultimately, the economic prosperity of the colony.' He went on to say that he could not see that there was much point in giving women the vote because `a wife's view of certain issues could be expected to be similar to that of her husband's and, therefore, it would simply be a duplication of the vote.' Perhaps the worst thing he said was, `Nature itself acts as an impediment to women's participation in the parliament.' I would be too embarrassed to quote further. I mention that because, although we still may have a way to go, considerable progress has been made, and that should be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could mention also those who have been the heroes of the women's movement, but I will not do that because I think there are so many who have never been recognised and who probably deserve just as much recognition. There is no doubt that our society, through our system of awards, still does not adequately recognise the role of mothers, the role of home keepers and the enormous role of women in voluntary community service. I will not spoil it for the many hundreds of thousands of those who deserve to be mentioned and will not be by recognising, as I said, those who have received so much credit in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few minutes that I have, I want to put back on the agenda some of the issues that are causing me continuing worry in this area. I do not think the Labor government has recognised that the recession it induced through incompetent economic policy cost Australian women an enormous amount. I do not think the Australian Labor Party recognises what Hugh Mackay talks about as the new underclass in Australia that developed out of the growing gap between the rich and poor as a result of Labor's policies and that that new underclass so much includes Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party failed to recognise that not only was it the case that so many women lost their jobs&mdash;women being the easiest group to lose work in a recession because so many are still in part-time employment&mdash;but it was also the case that there was an enormous strain placed upon women when husbands lost employment and families had no breadwinner for a very long period of time, which placed incredible stress on children as well. That is a responsibility that Labor ought to recognise. At a time when we see Labor economic policies very much going down the same path that we saw in the late 1980s, the government should be reminded of the consequences of incompetent economic policy, and particularly the consequences to women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are more than 627,000 children in one-parent families in this country, with 84,000 having a female head. Of these one-parent families, 36 per cent of the parents</PARA>
<PARA>have been unemployed for a year or more, with the average duration of unemployment being 61 weeks. The Labor Party should also recognise that although the number of women in employment has risen&mdash;as I said a moment ago&mdash;it is part-time employment where women have made gains. Some appreciate that opportunity, as that is the type of employment they want, but for many there is no other alternative. Women have been treated in an inferior way, having inferior opportunities to men in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor should also recognise that women's work is all too often still concentrated in areas of less skill and lower wages. In this country average wages for women remain lower when compared with those of men. On average, women's wages are still just over 80 per cent of men's wages. That is something that should not last forever. All parties should commit themselves to seeking to overcome this through sensible economic policy, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor should recognise that, under its record, the long-term duration of unemployment of women increased from 67 weeks in 1984 to 112 weeks 10 years later. That is not a proud record for Australian women. Also, Labor should recognise that policies in relation to retirement income are still inadequate. It is time that some of these serious matters were addressed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles made it quite clear that we are debating the achievements of and contributions made by women within the community, and the progress achieved by women in the quest for true equality. So, in actual fact, very few of those women are able to speak within these walls or, indeed, within the walls of the other place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, as International Women's Day is being celebrated across the country, it is important that we do remember all women throughout the country; that we do not just look at the high-fliers. While we obviously have great admiration for many of those high-fliers who are speaking in various forums today, it is very important that we recognise ordinary Australian women who are out there in the work force, in their homes, in the community, as carers and as volunteers. It is so important that we say to them, `International Women's Day is for you.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, sorry. Today is a day when we can congratulate all Australian women for what they do in struggling through in various situations of adversity, as Senator Kernot put it so effectively. I would just give a few facts that I think are important on an occasion such as this, but I point out to Senator Hill that they will not be political point scoring facts. As to women as carers, 67 per cent of all principal carers are women; 64 per cent of women carers care for a person in their main home or residence. The highest representation of women carers is in the 35- to 44-year-old age group&mdash;and that is 77 per cent. That is, 77 per cent in the 35- to 44-year-old age group in many instances are forgoing or certainly compromising other elements of their lives and ambitions by virtue of their caring role. It is of those women I would like to make special mention and to recognise and praise their contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all age groups up to the 70- to 74-year-old age group, women are more likely than men to have been the principle carer in the household. The labour force participation rate for female carers is 41 per cent compared with 59 per cent for all women. It is important today to identify just what would happen in Australia if even just for one day, perhaps for International Women's Day, all those carers who essentially are volunteers and all those volunteers around the country were to say, `We're not going to work today; we're going to force governments to recognise precisely the value, the economic worth, of our voluntary contribution.' Of course, we all know that those volunteers and carers would not stop work for an hour, let alone a day. They know the very dramatic impact that that would have on old people, sick people, young people and children. It is quite impossible to even imagine such an eventuality. But it is important for us to pause and think, `Gosh, what would happen if every carer and volunteer in Australia were to say, "We will not work today"?' It would serve to bring home the message to governments of just how much we rely on volunteers. So it is of those women who are achieving so much that I make special mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also make mention of changes in the level of qualifications of Australian women. Something that is not generally recognised, not generally known, is just how much women in the last 10 to 15 years have benefited from changes in education, with the corresponding percentage change in qualifications. As we all know, the modern world demands much more in the way of qualifications, so I would give these statistics because I think they are very important. In higher degrees, the percentage increase between 1986 and 1991 was 92 per cent&mdash;that is, women achieving a higher degree. Of women achieving a bachelor degree it is 93 per cent, and it is 90 per cent achieving another form of diploma qualification. That is particularly important to record as an achievement because, again, it is not easy to do the double shift&mdash;that is, to work at home and in the work force&mdash;but it is even less easy to do the triple shift, which many women are doing, by studying, doing work outside the home and also keeping the work in the home going. So I would pay tribute to those women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also record the changes in the level of qualification for indigenous women within the same period, 1986 to 1991. The policies of government&mdash;and I said I was not going to be political&mdash;are reflected very much in these statistics that I am giving here. In regard to higher degree qualification of indigenous women, the percentage change has been 237 per cent. I know we are dealing with small numbers, and that can change the effect of percentage impressions. But I think this is an enormous change in the pattern of indigenous women gaining qualifications, and it should be recorded on International Women's Day 1995. In regard to a bachelor degree, the percentage change is 297.1 per cent; and in regard to other qualifications, 212 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the government's status of women committee took the opportunity to talk with about 70 young women from colleges and schools in Canberra about how the world has changed for women since 1975, because as we celebrate International Women's Day in 1995 we look back to how the world was in 1975. The exchanges that we had between those young women and members of the government caucus women's committee were very revealing in terms of young women recognising how much the world has changed but, indeed, how much more has to be done. In concluding, I would like to acknowledge the fact that Senator Knowles brought this matter of public importance to the chamber and I thank her for it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising on International Women's Day the achievements and contributions of women within our community and the progress achieved by women in the quest for true equality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sometimes, unfortunately, some members on the other side forget that women's issues did not start with the Labor Party winning the federal election after a long period of Liberal government at the federal level. When one looks at the history of the Liberal Party and, in particular, at the formation of the Liberal Party, one sees that women played a crucial role in the formation of our great party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Sir Robert Menzies founded the party in the mid-1940s he had the support and financial backing of an organisation called the Australian Women's National League, a very powerful organisation with a large number of members who were in influential positions in organisations throughout Australia. It was originally formed in the early 1900s as an independent women's organisation with the aim of informing women about political issues. However, by the time the Liberal Party was established it had become the main political party for women interested in non-Labor politics, with over 40,000 financial members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally considered that in the mid-1940s the league had no equal in Australia and its members were renowned for being highly motivated and well trained in electoral matters. So they were women who were active in their community, active politically, who actually played an enormous part. Sir Robert Menzies said at the founding of the party:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are unquestionably destined to exercise more and more influence upon practical politics in Australia. There was a time when they were thought to stand aside, exercising only passive influence. That has gone.</PARA>
<PARA>From the formation of the Liberal Party the importance of women was clearly recognised. I will not go through issue by issue the administrative level and the organisational level of the party and the role that women have played there. Senator Troeth, one of my colleagues here in the Senate, has played a senior role in the Liberal Party of Victoria as Country Vice-President and she is just one example of the many women who have played very senior roles in our party throughout the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are celebrating women's achievements and we look at the achievement of women on the conservative side of politics, we see in the number of firsts a long history and a long list of achievements. The first woman elected to any Australian parliament was Edith Cowan in Western Australia. At a federal level women from the conservative parties have also made their mark. The first woman to become a federal member of parliament was Dame Enid Lyons, elected to the House of Representatives for the United National Party. She went on to become the first female federal cabinet minister, serving in the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first government whip in a Westminster-style parliament was Senator Annabelle Rankin, later Dame Annabelle Rankin. The first woman to serve as a member of a federal cabinet and have portfolio responsibility for a federal government department was my predecessor, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle. Her ministerial portfolios included education, social security and finance. The first female member of a state cabinet was Dame Florence Cardell-Oliver. In 1947 she was appointed the first minister for health, supply and shipping in a Liberal Western Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first female state president of any major political party was Mrs Joy Mein. The appointment of Senator Margaret Reid and Senator Sue Knowles as opposition whip and deputy whip respectively in 1987 represented the first time either house of the federal parliament had two women in these positions. So we have a long history of women in our party playing significant important roles in its formation and in its parliamentary life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving aside from that and looking at the role that women have played in the community, I think back to the stories my grandmother told me about her aunt. My grandmother was orphaned and her aunt reared her. My old aunt was single and wanted the licence of a hotel. In those days one had to be married to get a licence of a hotel, so she did that and had the marriage annulled three days after she got the licence. I was only four when she died. I wish she had lived a little longer so I could have got to know her, but I wonder whether her influence has not rubbed off on me through my grandmother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken many significant steps towards improving the lot of women since the days when my aunt had to take that drastic step. But all too often these advances that women have made have been achieved despite rather than because of government policy. The runs are on the board, but we should not kid ourselves that the innings are over. Women in this country still have a long way to go before we arrive at real and lasting equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I outlined earlier today in taking note of an answer given by Senator Crowley that the Australian Public Service has a long way to go in appointing women at senior levels. As I said, across the Public Service only 16 per cent of Senior Executive Service jobs are held by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite women's achievement in the private sector as well, we still have a long way to go there. While women make up 42 per cent of the Australian work force, they occupy less than three per cent of senior management jobs and directorships. This is really despite the existence of government programs that Senator Crowley referred to earlier today in her answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have demonstrated that they can thrive when the shackles of the male corporate culture pervading most realms of business and government are absent. We see this most clearly in small business. Senator Kernot expressed her reasons as to why women may have succeeded in small business. It may be that women have succeeded in small business because, as I said, they are not shackled by the sorts of structures and male corporate culture that pervade business and government. It should come as no surprise, especially since Senator Kernot outlined it, that a massive 70 per cent of small businesses are run by women and they have been successful in that area as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make five brief points in the five brief minutes I have. The first is to say that on International Women's Day I wish that, instead of giving recognition to women's achievements, we simply give recognition to women. What we want is not necessarily a cooption of women into the achievements that our male dominated society values but to see a transformation of our society so that all human beings are valued for the contributions they already make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to that, because putting women in power is not the same as empowering women. We should give power to women where they are in our society and community today and not necessarily put so much emphasis on incorporating them into our structures. I think it is a matter of justice that there should be 50 per cent representation in all spheres of society if we have a healthy society. However, we must recognise that the role of women in today's world is far more important than the place that they gain in society's patriarchal structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Earth Summit in Rio there was a paper submitted on women's development, and Australia's contribution was to say that we would appoint more women as leaders because we recognised that women around the world do 60 per cent of the work in environmental care with 30 per cent of the resources. A very respected friend of mine, Elaine Horne, who is a teacher, a mother and a worker for social action within the community, said to me, `Christabel, why is Australia saying that it will put more women in positions of power? Why don't you give me the power and the resources that I need to keep doing the work I am already doing where I am? Why do you want to take me up some kind of bureaucratic ladder to give me authority?' I think it is a very valid point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I want to raise is the very tragic thing which happened yesterday in terms of the recognition of women and women's spirituality, and that was the fight that arose over the handling of the women's secrets of spirituality belonging to the Ngarrindjeri people. I want to tender, on International Women's Day, an apology to the Ngarrindjeri women for the male sacrilege that took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to lay blame anywhere because I believe this is an inevitable part of the structure if we have a male minister for Aboriginal affairs and the handling of materials is so male oriented that it gets into the male hands of a shadow environment minister and is distributed precisely against the wishes of those people. We have done the women a grave injustice. I want to register my deepest apology to the women and to make a plea for the respect and the recognition of women's spirituality all over the world, including this country and, in particular, for Aboriginal women's spiritualty, which they are only just venturing to share with us as part of the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fourth point I want to make is that feminism has been suggested as having three stages by the author Ivone Gebara. The first stage is to recognise the historical oppression of women. The second stage is to work for gender balance. The third stage, which is the most important, is to work for a transformation of our society so that all injustices in our structures are addressed and so that patriarchal and hierarchical structures are changed so that women and their contribution in our world today are recognised and embraced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to close with a description of what a new feminine paradigm would mean. It is one which needs both men and women working together, because if men do not devolve some of the power that they have accumulated over the last 5,000 years, the world will not be a better or richer place. The feminine paradigm emphasises process and interaction and a transformational reform of our structures. It is based on these key ideas: direct democracy, respecting the interconnection of all life, creating a synthesis out of adversarial positions, transcending old definitions of left and right and searching for common ground and the good of the whole. </PARA>

As I understand it, normally these reports are tabled in the Senate and, therefore, there is not the opportunity to speak to them. But, on this occasion, it was presented to the President and therefore you, on his behalf, tabled this report. As a result, it falls into the category where it can be discussed. I may be wrong on that. I am simply seeking your guidance as to whether I have the procedure correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before debate on the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Bill (No. 2) 1994 was interrupted, the minister at the table indicated to me that the part of the explanatory memorandum that dealt with changing indictable offences to summary offences related to only those sections of the act where the penalties had actually been increased. I seek the guidance of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) on whether 500 penalty units equates to $10,000. Looking at item 6 of the schedule on page 4, which deals with amendments to subsection 38, I ask the minister whether the note relating to a body corporate which suggests that the penalty will be five times the maximum fine is an increase in penalty. If that is the case, does the advice given to me previously about indictable offences being converted to summary offences only still stand? That is, does the comment in the explanatory memorandum relate only when there have been increases in penalties?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will summarise what has happened so far. We have an act which has been in operation for 10 years and has apparently worked well. It has worked so well that for 10 years the government has not sought to amend it. Secondly, the government can produce no evidence that the present act has not been effective in relation to the damage to the reef and the ability of the authority to take action against those who have damaged the reef. Thirdly, the opposition agrees that the government is wrong in its claim that the amendments strengthen the act and that, in fact, the amendments weaken the act. Fourthly, the government agrees that the factors of intention and negligence would be taken into account by the courts even if the strict liability of the present act were to stay unchanged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we must draw the conclusion that, taking all these factors together, the government is deliberately weakening the act without a need and with no demonstrable benefit in terms of the rights and protection of people and those who offend against those sections which the government seeks to amend. One is left rather confused as to why the government is doing this. </PARA>

I previously indicated that the coalition was not going to support the first series of amendments because we really had not had sufficient notice of them and had not considered them. I then went on to say that, for my own part, having listened to the debate and contributed to a minor extent, I would not have thought we should support the amendments even if we were going to consider them on their merits. Since that time, Mr McLachlan, the coalition member responsible for this legislation, has had the chance to consider the amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the committee that I was called away earlier during part of this debate on the Environment, Sport and Territories Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 and was not able to contribute. For the benefit of the committee, and particularly Senator Coulter, who has circulated these amendments, I will put on the record the government's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments Nos 1 to 11 proposed by the Australian Democrats relate to the degree to which a person intended to commit an offence or the degree to which they were negligent in allowing an offence to occur. The bill proposes that a person must intentionally or negligently commit an offence. Senator Coulter's amendments to the bill propose that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of accepting the amendments proposed by Senator Coulter would be that a person who, for example, innocently strays into a restricted zone of the marine park with no intention to commit an offence could only defend their actions by claiming that they had made an honest and reasonable mistake. That is a defence not always accepted by a court. The prosecution would be required to prove only that the offence had occurred. If the act is amended as proposed in the bill, the prosecution would be required to prove that the person intentionally or negligently committed the offence. Senator Coulter's amendment to the bill would be contrary to the government's policy with regard to offences, with significant penalties under the criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's amendment No. 12 falls into a slightly different category in that it seeks to remove the definition of intentional damage from proposed section 38J, which relates to waste discharge in the marine park. If that proposed amendment to the bill is made it will allow a person who recklessly discharges waste into the marine park to avoid prosecution, which is, I assume, the reverse of what Senator Coulter intended to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a new section 38L for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act which relates to the liability of owners, operators and masters&mdash;that would be of vessels, or aircraft or platforms&mdash;for waste discharge by other people. This allows the prosecution of owners, operators and masters in circumstances where they were not directly connected with the commission of the offence but knew or expected that the offence would occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Coulter's amendment 13 proposes to change the circumstances where owners, operators and masters could be prosecuted for the offence committed by others, even though they may have no knowledge of the commission of the offence. It is for these reasons that the government will not be supporting the amendments that have been circulated in Senator Coulter's name. I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA>This remaining amendment has been slightly modified in relation to the wording after some representations from the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a brief contribution to the debate on amendment 14 which has been proposed by Senator Coulter. I thank him for revising the wording of his original amendment in relation to the protection of the world heritage values of the marine park and the adoption of the precautionary principle in the making of management plans. As I have said in this chamber on many occasions, the government is committed to the protection of the world heritage values of world heritage areas. Senator Coulter's revised amendment makes explicit what I think was implicit in the bill&mdash;that management plans should protect world heritage values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precautionary principle is embodied in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment. The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, signed by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments in 1992, includes the commitment that policy making should be informed by a number of principles. One of those principles is the precautionary principle. The amendment put forward by Senator Coulter is therefore broadly consistent with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition used is from the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment. I do not know how that quite fits with some of the comments Senator Coulter has made in the past about that particular document, but the definition used is from the IGAE. It is also effected in the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994, and I will not repeat the same political point that I made just a moment ago. I indicate to you, Mr Chairman, that the government will accept the amendment in its revised form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some points in relation to this amendment. Although the Greens support the amendment by the Democrats, we have some concerns. One is that the meaning proposed in IGAE section 3.5.1 does not adequately reflect the urgency of the need to apply this principle. I had to smile when the minister referred to that, because he would be well aware that the Greens have the same kinds of concerns about the IGAE as the Democrats have previously expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am sure you did. The reason we are raising this is that the definition in 3.5.1 allows for careful evaluation to avoid serious or irreversible damage but includes the loophole of `where practicable'. The other concern we have about it is that, where there is not the political will within the government and the bureaucracy to act on it, it may fail to take environmental protection seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in supporting the amendment, I also urge that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority takes the principle to heart and puts in place a long-term strategic and integrated approach that will provide the area with the protection it deserves. I do not know whether the minister wants to comment on that or whether Senator Coulter has taken that into consideration, but it seems to me that that loophole&mdash;where there is not the political will to actually abide by the precautionary principle and to establish the very needed protection for our marine environments&mdash;is very dangerous. </PARA>

But she is obviously not interested in these things. She is interested in the glamour items when it comes to International Women's Day. When there is a serious matter relating to the way women are to be searched, all Senator Crowley can do is parade about in a politically point scoring way. Senator Crowley, who has provoked me, has now left the chamber, so I can get on with explaining to my colleagues just what this amendment is about. I repeat my apology that this has only just been tabled. As I say, it has only just been brought more clearly to my attention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in my contribution to the second reading debate that a number of representations have been made to me by the boating fraternity in North Queensland about these powers of search. Since the second reading debate, I have been able to investigate one aspect of those powers a little further. It was pointed out to me by the boating fraternity in North Queensland that the powers being given to inspectors particularly in relation to search provide, as stated in clause 46C(1):</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ordinary search or a frisk search of a person under this Part must, if practicable, be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched.</PARA>
<PARA>So where it is practicable the inspector must be of the same sex as the person being searched. If I can put that in an example: if two male inspectors are out on the reef, they come across a boat load of three women and take them into custody or arrest them for some reason, they then, if it is practicable, can get someone of the same sex to search them. But in the incident I give as an example it would not be practicable for someone of the same sex to search them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Crichton-Browne interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is different, Senator Crichton-Brown. The position then would be that the two male inspectors could then search by means of a frisk search the three women out on the boat in the reef kilometres from everywhere. I do not think that is appropriate. I think that the way the legislation was originally worded is the best way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendment does not interfere with the government's proposals to amend this section of the bill and leaves its style and its procedure as it is. What I have simply tried to do in 46C(1) is reverse it to what those powers of search were previously. Those powers of search previously stated, as my amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ordinary search or a frisk search of a person under this Part shall be conducted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it then reverts to the original wording&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) an inspector of the same sex as the person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is quite clear&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) in a case where an inspector of the same sex as the person is not available to conduct this search&mdash;any other person who is of the same sex and is requested by an inspector to conduct the search.</PARA>
<PARA>So in the incident that I raise if another female happens to be around, although that other female may not be an inspector, an inspector can ask this other female to carry out the search. Senator Faulkner seems to be waving a white flag. He may understand this. Senator Coulter might not have thrown in the white flag. Perhaps anyone who might happen to be listening to this, including the boating fraternity in North Queensland, would prefer me to finish what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, if the two inspectors are male and there is another female around who is not an inspector, the inspectors can ask the other female to search, for instance, the three females that they have apprehended.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate in the Senate is a continuation of that which took place two days ago and it relates to a package of bills which replaces the Audit Act of 1901. The Audit Act was one of the first acts passed by the federal parliament. It demonstrates the importance that the early members of this parliament placed on the question of accountability and audit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my previous remarks, I took the opportunity of outlining the fact that these bills recognise many of the reforms that have taken place, particularly in enhancing the role of accountability. I was surprised that, in a sense, they have moved backwards rather than forwards in two areas. I pointed out, for example, that in 1989 the mandate of the Auditor-General's office was far wider than that which is provided in this bill. I also drew the Senate's attention to the constant battles that this Senate chamber, in particular, has had with sections of the bureaucracy over the mandate of the Auditor-General's office in relation to his power to audit Commonwealth instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I drew honourable senators' attention to the fact that we did have notable victories. I can name three statutory type corporations: the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the National Rail Corporation. The Senate believed that essentially the Australian National Audit Office should have the prime responsibility for auditing these sorts of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then noted that the Auditor-General at the time, Mr Taylor, for whom I have a great deal of respect, pointed out that the proposals with the limited mandate do miss the opportunity to set the standard of public accountability and model arrangements for the operation of a modern Australian National Audit Office which would serve not only the parliament and the government but also the community well into the 21st century. Without such a mandate, the parliament and the community would be the losers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the bill in its present form will be subject to extensive amendment and change as a result of the processes of this chamber and probably a more fuller review than what has taken place in the past. I issue a warning that in its present form it demonstrates parliament's complacency, which can lead to a dulling of our capacity to perceive certain problems in public service areas. In this case, according to the bills as they stand at the moment, the Australian National Audit Office had resourcing difficulties imposed upon it because of its lack of a meaningful mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the bill establishes the Auditor-General to be the sole auditor of all Commonwealth-owned bodies, which in effect reverses a trend to permit private sector auditors to perform certain audits, there are two exceptions. I wish to deal with those two exceptions: government business enterprises and statutory marketing authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the assurances that were given by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) some time ago, when he believed there was little to be gained by subjecting GBEs to performance audits by the Australian National Audit Office. The Hon. Kim Beazley indicated that he believed the discipline to be efficient is imposed through the focus on targets and related performance measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further reason submitted by the government is that the government believed it had taken other steps to further improve the accountability of the GBEs, or government business enterprises. I take this opportunity to respond to those statements. Firstly, the government has failed to outline&mdash;certainly in the press statement&mdash;those measures which would further improve the accountability of GBEs without the mandate of the Auditor-General extending his performance audits into those areas. It is incumbent on the minister at the moment to list them because, after all, they were statements in a press release and this is the appropriate opportunity for the minister to respond and categorically list the measures that have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, unless there is competition or independent scrutiny&mdash;we have to acknowledge that the independent scrutiny of the Australian National Audit Office is more comprehensive when we look at other issues, such as the social responsibilities of GBEs&mdash;there is no necessary assurance about the tightness of the performance measurement indicators of a GBE. They can be set fairly easily. Further, while technically the audit committee of the parliament may request a performance audit, there is no assurance that such a request would be effective. Given what I would call the dulling of the parliament's capacity to look at some of these issues, we have to be somewhat concerned about this issue and, in short, the restriction of that mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the Senate to restore the mandate of this package of bills. The Auditor-General should be reinstated for performance audits as the external auditor of the statutory marketing authorities and as the external auditor of all government business enterprises and all companies that the government has a controlling interest in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, I introduced into this chamber the private members bill entitled Audit (Auditor-General an Officer of the  Parliament) Amendment Bill 1993. The bill passed through the Senate. Its purpose was to ensure that the appointment of the Auditor-General would rest with the parliament, not the executive, so that the Auditor-General be seen to be not only an officer of the parliament but also independent of the government. I remind the Senate that the Auditor-General is an independent auditor of government operations. The office has historically stood somewhere between the parliament and the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office fulfils a most important function in scrutinising how government bodies conduct themselves. But this operation has not been free of problems. There is an inherent conflict between the desire of the executive government and its bureaucracies to operate free of restraints and, to some extent, accountability and the desire of those who provide the wealth for these operations&mdash;the citizens of Australia, who are represented by this parliament&mdash;to remain fully informed of what the government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the current bill, together with the coalition amendments, if adopted, will go some way towards meeting the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its original report No. 296, one essential missing element is the Auditor-General's being an officer of the parliament. I fail to see that my private members bill, having passed this place with the support of the parliament, fails to get up in these tranches of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the attention of honourable senators to a media release dated 22 June 1994 by my colleague the federal member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who was previously a respected chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. At the time of making this statement, he was secretary to the shadow cabinet. The honourable member for Bradfield said that the new legislative package would fail to ensure the necessary independence of the Auditor-General and would not provide the Auditor-General's office with the full protection of parliament. I concur with my colleague's remarks. Apart from the mandate, the second problem I have with the package is the refusal to recognise the concept of being an officer of the parliament. It goes fairly close to it in terms of audit committees, but the opportunity for complete responsibility has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government reforms strengthen the independence and role of the Auditor-General in that he will be much more closely responsible to the parliament through his remuneration being set by an audit committee, et cetera, it will tend to diminish the role of the Department of Finance. I must take this opportunity to congratulate the Department of Finance. Together with the Auditor-General's office, it is a clinical department that is responsible for, and has achieved a great deal in, improved accountability. Officers of the Department of Finance have largely been instrumental in bringing this bill to account. In a number of areas, we have to recognise that they are the servants of the government of the day. We cannot challenge them in terms of what is or is not in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way that some of the issues have been dealt with is of symbolic significance. Unfortunately, they will not have the bearing that they should have, unless they are suitably amended in terms of the Auditor-General's independence. I also remind the Senate of the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times </EMPHASIS>of 22 June 1994, which demonstrates very clearly that appearances are also very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, when I was a member of it, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts identified five reasons underlying the National Audit Office problems at the time. One of them is parliament's complacency. Another is that the office fell between the two stools of the legislature and the executive with neither apparently willing to take responsibility for the condition of the office as much as it should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a lack of mechanism, allowing parliament to assume responsibility for the office. I acknowledge that this has improved as a result of some of these measures, which hopefully will be passed today. There was previous overemphasis on the economy of operation of the audit office rather than on re-appraising the contribution it has made to effective and good government. Again, we should pay a tribute to the very positive leadership of John Taylor, who came to head the office without a lot of experience in the audit area. He showed fearsome independence and did a lot to bring the audit office into the modern day era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is drawing to a close. The Auditor-General must be not only freely independent in controlling these sorts of activities but also seen to be independent. For that reason, I drew the Senate's attention to the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. I believe that constituting the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament would contribute greatly towards this objective. I remind the Senate that many senators have short-term memories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, in order to try to restore that mandate, because I was fearful that there were not too many amendments coming up, I took the unusual step of presenting to a Senate committee a submission from a senator, myself, when it was inquiring into this package of bills. I did so because I was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for over 16 years and served at the forefront of a great deal of public sector reform&mdash;reforms that were initiated basically through those parliaments. During those years I was naturally very closely involved with the work of the Auditor-General and in the issue of the reform of the Audit Act of 1901. So it was with a degree of reluctance that I made a submission. I was pleased that I did because it has certainly borne fruit in drawing attention to the problem of mandate. We now have many amendments which seek to pick up these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out that there were weaknesses inherent in the bill that were not fully addressed previously and that these matters had to be addressed. So I urge the Senate to look carefully at the amendments that have been put forward&mdash;and not only by the Liberal Party. I understand there is an amendment moved by the Democrats in relation to whistleblowers which, I know, addresses the situation in the whistleblowers committee. Some aspects of that legislation were contrary to the report of that important committee, headed by my colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman. But my time has expired. I urge my colleagues to pass the bills appropriately amended. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one major aspect of this legislation, the Auditor-General Bill, which I would like to address, and that is the audit mandate. That is a matter to which Senator Watson has just briefly referred and, indeed, a matter which he brought to the attention of the Senate finance and public administration committee in a submission. I would certainly like to support the comments of Senator Watson and stress the seriousness and the unacceptability of attempting to restrict the Auditor-General's mandate, as this bill does in clauses 14 and 15.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a glaring inconsistency in the Auditor-General Bill 1994 in relation to the stated intention as set out in the explanatory memorandum to clauses 14 and 15, which deal with Commonwealth authorities and subsidiaries and set out in relation to that the scope of the Auditor-General's power to undertake performance audits. Specifically, clause 14, subsection (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a Commonwealth authority that is a GBE&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a government business enterprise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or any of its subsidiaries, if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) both Houses of the Parliament, by resolution, request the audit; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the responsible Minister requests the audit.</PARA>
<PARA>This clause reflects the government's intention to restrict the performance audit mandate in relation to government business enterprises following a government indication that it considered there was little to be gained by subjecting GBEs, whether they were companies or statutory authorities, and their subsidiaries to performance audits. The Auditor-General's report No.43 of 1993-94, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliament's right to know</EMPHASIS>, at section 2.9 states that the government's response to report 296 concerning the performance audit mandate of the Auditor-General is inconsistent. Report 296, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>, was the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which inquired into the Australian National Audit Office. That report was tabled in 1989. The Auditor-General's report No. 43 goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepted the Committee's Recommendation that the Auditor-General continue to have responsibility for performance audits, but, in fact, reduces the performance audit mandate by suggesting that in the ordinary course of events there is little to be gained by subjecting government business enterprises, whether they are companies or statutory authorities, to performance audits.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 2.10 of audit report No. 43 goes on to list seven major points which this government decision to exclude government business enterprises from performance audits ignores. The report states further that, no matter how commercial GBEs may be, they owe their existence to parliament. However, proposed provisions of the Auditor-General Bill 1994 have diminished access to information about their operations and activities, particularly to their public interest responsibilities. The Auditor-General stated quite clearly that he believed that GBEs would not be subject to the full range of necessary accountability requirements in the future as a result of this legislation. The exclusion of GBEs from performance audits unless there is a ministerial request or following a resolution of both houses of parliament, as provided in clause 14(2) of the bill, is described as `an unwarranted step backwards'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the Auditor-General's report No. 43 states that, in the light of recent events in some states, the decision to exclude GBEs from performance audits could expose ministers to potential allegations of attempts to avoid the operations of GBEs being subject and exposed to external review. At section 217 the report also states that this legislation is `against the trend outlined in various state government initiated reviews'. It cites the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission and the Western Australian Royal Commission into the Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in 1992, the well-known royal commission into the nefarious WA Inc. of the then Labor government. The royal commission recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All public sector bodies, programs and activities involving any use of public resources be the subject of audit by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General, in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliament's right to know</EMPHASIS>, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask the Parliament to consider the implications of this current package of legislation for its future ability to scrutinise the conduct and performance of individual GBEs.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to recommend that the parliament amend the Auditor-General Bill to provide the Auditor-General with unfettered authority to undertake performance audits of all Commonwealth owned and controlled agencies, authorities, companies and their subsidiaries of whatever legal form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's position has been the subject of a great deal of discussion over a long period of time. The reason is obvious: the Auditor-General' role is crucial to the process of accountability of governments to the taxpayer through direct reports to the parliament. This independent reporting to parliament is necessary for accountability and transparency and is fundamental to democratic government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while this bill is allegedly designed to strengthen the role of the Auditor-General, clauses 14(2) and 15(2) will, in fact, weaken it, and that is a very sad state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent refusal of the National Media Liaison Service, the infamous government propaganda arm, the scurrilous aNiMaLS, to provide access to or enter into discussion with the Australian National Audit Office is the most recent and obvious obstruction by the executive arm of government. If anyone ought to be subject to investigation by the Auditor-General, it ought to be this disgraceful propaganda arm of the government. Of course, that body is fully funded by the taxpayer, to the tune of $1.5 million in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also implications for the states which may have been overlooked in the process of developing this federal legislation. Since report 296 was tabled in 1989, several states have moved to expand the powers of the state auditors-general and have relied very heavily on Commonwealth legislation and resources for leadership in effecting reforms at the state level. The reason is quite simple: the Commonwealth has resources available to it across a wide range of portfolio areas which the states simply do not have. The auditors-general are well known to each other and monitoring systems overlap the states and the Commonwealth by means of a series of performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the lack of comparable resources available to the states, it is highly likely that moves to restrict the mandate of the federal Auditor-General will be adopted very rapidly by the states. Again, that is a backward step, particularly because state government business enterprises represent a much larger proportion of the state economies than do Commonwealth government business enterprises in relation to the economy overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact at a state level is much more direct on taxpayers than at the federal level. The state GBEs&mdash;for example, electricity and water boards&mdash;use public money and charge a wide range of fees directly to the consumer or taxpayer. The degree of insulation for the taxpayer from the federal GBEs arises from their very nature&mdash;shipping lines, telecommunications facilities, airlines and so on&mdash;but citizens are not so insulated from the activities of GBEs at the state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pooling of resources does become an issue if the Department of Finance has its way and succeeds in its attempt to pull the Auditor-General's mandate away from areas which the department does not want examined. The concern is that the states will adopt similar restrictions in the same way that they embraced the expanded roles, identified in report No. 296, with much more significant consequences for the state economies. I understand that there will be further addressing of these issues of performance audit mandates in the committee stage of the bill, but I certainly want to add my comments in support of the proposed amendments to clauses 14 and 15, which will be moved during that committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to evidence given by Professor Finn to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee investigation of this particular piece of legislation. He raised concerns about clause 34 of the legislation. As it is structured, clause 34 is one about which he says, `I would counsel no parliament in this country ever to accede to.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome my colleague's support for those words from Professor Finn. I also agree with his comments in that regard. Paragraph 34(3)(f) of the Auditor-General Bill states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">any other reason that could form the basis for a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in a judicial proceeding that the information should not be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 34 deals with those circumstances under which the Auditor-General must not include particular information in a public report. Professor Finn says that this particular part of clause 34 takes out any ground of public interest privilege in a court. He believes that this is another backward step as regards this legislation because it gives the Attorney-General absolute discretion to give an exclusive certificate. Once that is given under subclause 34(3), the reporting procedure that is countenanced in consequence results in the information not going to any arm of government other than to the executive arm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion Professor Finn reached in the evidence he gave to the legislation committee was that clause 34 is far too far reaching in what it can exclude. He believes that there is no need for the clause to be so embracing to protect the legitimate interests of government. I simply add my concern to that which was raised by Professor Finn in the hearings of the legislation committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I hope that in the committee stage of this legislation there will be some account taken of that evidence by Professor Finn and an appropriate reaction developed to it. If we are going to protect the role of the Auditor-General and if, as has always been intended, the Auditor-General is to be responsible directly to the parliament for the public accountability of government instrumentalities, then this is a clause that needs very careful consideration. They are the two areas I wished to address in relation to this legislation&mdash;clauses 14 and 15, to which I referred earlier, and this clause 34. I trust that the Senate will take my remarks into account in the committee stage. </PARA>

First of all, I will express my concerns in relation to a particular government business enterprise that people have heard me talk about before and, in speaking of that, I will express my concerns about some of the legislation that is before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability to parliament is at the heart of the Westminster democratic system. Parliament appropriates funds to the executive government and the ministers are accountable to parliament for the conduct of their portfolios. In theory, then, a government business enterprise like Australian Defence Industries, of which the minister is the `owner', is accountable to the parliament via the minister. The case is not the same, of course, for private sector firms such as the Submarine Corporation. There, the government negotiates and signs a contract. The firm is then bound by the terms of the contract, and the government is accountable to parliament for the contract it signs and for ensuring that its terms are faithfully executed. The firm itself is governed by relevant law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, government business enterprises have been allowed a great deal of freedom. The argument goes that if they are to operate as business enterprises they must be allowed to operate as closely as possible to private sector firms, without restrictions and the bureaucracy of the public sector. They can appeal to the commercial-in-confidence argument. They are bound by relevant law. That is, of course, unless you are dealing with bodies such as Australian Defence Industries, which claims that it is exempt from certain state and federal laws because it is defence related. This means that the government's investment, or taxpayers' money, is effectively removed from parliamentary scrutiny. The ADI experience makes this crystal clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted, private sector contractors are even further removed from public scrutiny, nor would existing laws allow the type of scrutiny applying in the public sector. After all, the firm is owned by its shareholders and not the taxpayer. But a firm like the Australian Securities Commission can sign a big contract with the government. ASC derives a massive proportion of its income from the government. The argument that the minister is accountable for the contract does not hold much water when the contract itself is commercial-in-confidence. The audit office report makes it clear that it was denied access to ASC records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out here that a public company, which is totally subject to normal commercial situations, does at least have an annual shareholders meeting. Shareholders have a vote and if the board is not doing the right thing the shareholders can vote to overrule or throw out their board members. We do not have that luxury with government business enterprises as they exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that allowing government business enterprises to operate as much as possible like other firms has removed large sums of taxpayers' money from effective parliamentary scrutiny. ADI is 100 per cent government owned, but we are told that estimates questions cannot be asked. Other means of scrutiny are blocked by commercial-in-confidence arguments. If anyone doubts that, they can look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and see examples of where I have been refused access to information in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private sector firms like the ASC receive large sums of taxpayers' money&mdash;in this case, billions of dollars. There is even less direct accountability because of its private ownership and even the contracts it signs with government are secret. This makes ministerial accountability excessively remote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the executive government is doing its best to evade accountability to parliament, yet there are some major disasters on the public record to show that this policy, even neglecting the theoretically and arguably idealistic framework given above, is fraught with danger. Three obvious cases are the State Bank disaster in Victoria, the State Bank disaster in South Australia, and the WA Inc. disaster in Western Australia. The first two cases of disasters were the direct result of the hands-off approach by government. The banks, government owned, were given boards largely comprised of private sector business types and were told to behave like business. They were told that government would not meddle. Governments did not meddle, the boards did what they did and in the end the taxpayers of both states had to pick up the tab. Governments were held responsible by the voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA case was even worse. The government itself acted like a private sector concern, propping up impending disasters like Rothwells and indulging in all sorts of questionable conduct. These cases are the end result of a philosophy which disconnects parliament from government involvement in commercial activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four bills being debated today replace the Audit Act and together form part of an important and complex set of arrangements to modernise and standardise financial accounting, reporting and ethical requirements applying to Commonwealth bodies. The stated aims of the legislation are laudable and appear to justify the care and attention that have been expended on them over what I understand is now a period approaching six years. It is unfortunate, however, that there are not many people in this place who know the details or who can accurately give you a briefing in relation to the details of these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central feature of the bills is that they enhance the capacity of the parliament to scrutinise the affairs of Commonwealth entities by bringing together in one or two key documents the minimum accountability requirements applying to all Commonwealth bodies. Apart from the impact on the Australian Public Service, the principal bill will replace the disparate accountability mechanisms spread throughout the Audit Act and numerous enabling acts establishing Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. The lines of accountability are, it is claimed, to be more clearly drawn and easier to keep up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat disappointing then that the present proposals suffer from at least one of the defects they are supposed to remedy. That defect is that the parliament has not yet had the opportunity to look at all the relevant pieces of legislation and the associated instruments, finance minister's orders and finance regulations, as a complete package. Moreover, the legislative package is, in itself, still incomplete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fifth bill is still in preparation to create the necessary linkages to the Commonwealth Authorities Act 1994 and a number of Commonwealth entities whose enabling legislation is not presently subject to part 11 of the Audit Act. My understanding is that it will apply to at least 40-plus bodies whose status at this time is yet to be determined. Ideally, all five bills in draft versions of the relevant delegated legislation should have been available to the parliament to consider as a total package. The reason for this is largely self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given that the present proposals form only part of the process of accountability, it is also worth noting that the failure of the government to present a comprehensive blueprint also leaves unanswered a number of broader questions about the accountability of specific entities under the new arrangements. My concerns here, as I mentioned before, partly stem from a particular interest in the activities of Australian Defence Industries Ltd&mdash;a government business enterprise within the portfolio of the Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given past difficulties in attempting to extract timely and detailed information on ADI from the minister, I am interested in how the new bills will apply to ADI. Yet, on examining the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill and the explanatory memorandum, it is not clear to me that Australian Defence Industries will even be covered by the financial accounting and ethical requirements to be established under the three substantive bills in this package. Perhaps we are to assume that ADI is one of the as yet unnamed 40 or so bodies which are to be the subject of the yet to be presented fifth bill in this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Defence Industries is, however, only one example. On the government's own admission, there are at least 40 other bodies of uncertain status under the proposals as presented. These are certainly matters which could and should have been addressed by the government in any of the relevant explanatory memoranda or the minister's second reading speech. In relation to government business enterprises generally, it is also of concern that the government does not appear to support the extension of all the basic elements of its own preferred system of accountability, as outlined in the bills, to all government business enterprises. As things stand, GBEs not funded through the annual appropriation bills are generally able to escape the estimates committee procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the provisions of the Auditor-General Bill stand, GBEs can be subject to performance audits only in exceptional circumstance; that is, at their own request or with the agreement of executive government. This is not good enough. Whilst GBEs continue to use public money and owe their existence to the parliament, they must remain fully accountable to the people's representatives. The package as presented, at least in respect of some Commonwealth entities, is an incomplete response to the parliament's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to know why these matters could not have been handled differently and which government bodies are to be the subject of the further transitional bill referred to by Senator Faulkner in his second reading speech on the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994. If the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) is able to mention that in his speech now, I would be grateful.

On my count there have been four speakers from the opposition and one from the Democrats and we have just heard from Senator Margetts for the Greens (WA). So we have had a fair spread of viewpoints across the spectrum represented here in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I will start by thanking and congratulating the speakers for the constructive way in which they have approached these bills. Indeed, a constructive approach has typified the story of this legislation throughout its quite long history. This legislation has not arisen recently; it arose from consideration entered into some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has involved consideration by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts in a report that it has prepared, views that the government holds about the role of the auditor and the Audit Act, and a series of considerations including considerations by a Senate committee hearing last Friday in which witnesses from the New South Wales Audit Office, our own audit office, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office, and so on appeared and put their views. A range of written submissions was put, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think binds all of the parties in a common purpose here is that these bills are about a quite important function in any government&mdash;the role of the auditor. There ought to be a huge degree of cohesion between all of us as to how we perceive that role and how that function is carried out because the auditor audits the books for the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's instrumentalities and the auditor ought to be like Caesar's wife&mdash;beyond reproach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have a common endeavour to find a broadly consistent approach to that and I think, in truth, we have succeeded almost entirely, but not quite, in doing that. So for people outside of this place who may see debate at a superficial level in here being fractious and divisive, this is a true occasion in which the chamber, from all perspectives, has endeavoured to find a common view and therefore address the overall issues of independence, prestige and importance that the auditor brings to public life in Australia as a modern democracy. A lot of people have put a lot more time into this than I have, and I congratulate all of them on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of points that I need to refer to in addressing the general debate. In the second reading debate on Monday, Senator Gibson, I understand, quite rightly pointed out the constitutional dimensions of the bills as they represent the operating framework for Commonwealth financial administration. As I said in my address to Senator Coates's committee on Friday, these bills are the product of the accumulated experience of 94 years of Commonwealth financial activities and it should be recognised that, while the bills are being sponsored by this government, they have not been drafted merely for this government; rather their benefits will continue to accrue to future governments, future parliaments, and future auditors-general in clarifying and strengthening their respective roles and functions in the field of Commonwealth financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, as the speakers in this debate have pointed out, a handful of provisions in the bills where the legitimate interests of the players do not mesh. Nevertheless, the government has gone a considerable way in seeking to achieve a genuinely workable balance of those interests. In the wake of the valuable work done by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts in its comprehensive analysis of the proposals last year, the government accepted 28 of the committee's 35 recommendations concerning the bills and has already incorporated the necessary amendments. Compared to the present framework, these bills will deliver for parliament, the audit office, the executive and, ultimately, the taxpayer major improvements in public sector financial accountability and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be in no-one's interest if those benefits were delayed any longer than necessary. However, if these bills do not pass in the current sittings, they could not sensibly be made to commence operating until the start of the 1996-97 financial year, because they will need to have passed into law before the drafting of the 1995-96 budget appropriation bills. As the budget bills directly integrate with the financial framework, they cannot be drafted to anticipate that a new FMA Act will be law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I caught the tail end of Senator Margetts's speech where she posed a question to me.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 [1995] amends the National Health Act to give legislative effect to a new pharmacy agreement between the government, the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. The amending bill replaces the essential pharmacy allowance for pharmacists in rural areas with two separate allowances. It stops grants to pharmacists who close or amalgamate their pharmacies as part of pharmacy restructuring arrangements. It also provides a new professional allowance to qualifying pharmacists for the performance of specific activities not directly related to the supply of pharmaceutical items. As well, it replaces the existing Pharmacy Restructuring Authority with the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. The new authority will make recommendations to government on applications for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefit items, to pay allowances to pharmacists in isolated and remote areas and to pay allowances for specific professional services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that the new agreement, due to take effect on 1 April, has not been signed. The government is taking legislative action in anticipation of an outcome. The current health insurance legislation is another example of such conduct, and the administrative establishment of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority last year proceeded in advance of the parliament's approval. I think it is incumbent upon us to make a point of this, because we need to highlight the government's arrogant treatment of parliamentary processes as a rubber stamp for executive action. I know that is not the first time it has occurred, but yet again we must stand and demonstrate our disapproval of this type of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that I want to bring to the attention of the Senate is that the Pharmacy Guild has also pointed out that the proposed professional allowance, with a total allocation of $2 million annually, does not go very far when notionally distributed among 4,000 pharmacies nationwide. It works out to be about $500 per pharmacy throughout the nation. It sounds like a great gesture, but yet again it is another example of the government coming out with something that, on the surface, looks to be a very good proposal but, in practice, means very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to draw the attention of the Senate to the pathetic excuse for an explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill. We had that evidenced again in discussion of a bill this morning. An explanatory memorandum which merely paraphrases the actual words of the bill, without any real attempt to explain or understand the bill's provisions, simply makes a mockery of the processes of the parliament. I have moved my amendment in the second reading stage, noting that the bill anticipates an agreement not yet signed, and criticising the government for treating the parliament as a rubber stamp by passing legislation to legitimise a set of circumstances still to be finalised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take very long on this bill. It is quite a simple piece of legislation. We will support the bill, and we do not have any amendments. The legislation provides for a new agreement covering community pharmacy. It is a continuation of the pharmaceutical restructuring program which has been going on for several years&mdash;a program which is supported by the pharmacy industry and which, I think it is fair to say, has been largely successful in its goal of rationalising the number and distribution of approved pharmacies across the country. As of December last year, the total number of pharmacies throughout Australia had declined by about 10 per cent, and more than 400 pharmacies were receiving the essential pharmacy allowance to ensure the supply of pharmaceuticals in remote and isolated areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister in her second reading speech said, the restructuring agreement has also contributed to a period of relative stability between the government and the pharmacy industry following a prolonged period of conflict in the late 1980s. This is not to say that the restructuring process has been trouble free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looked at the restructuring program in 1992, it found a number of problems&mdash;problems that were exacerbated by the fact that key criteria for many of the restructuring measures were not clearly defined. In short, while the committee had no major concerns about the policy behind the restructuring, our examination of the processes revealed something of an administrative nightmare. I have some concerns that this legislation may be a recipe for a similar set of problems, although I hope this is not the case. The community affairs committee has more than enough to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents the next step in the restructuring process. It replaces the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority with the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. This new authority will make recommendations in respect of applications for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits, the payment of allowances to pharmacists in remote and isolated areas, and the payment of allowances for specific professional services. From July of this year, the essential pharmacy allowance will be replaced by two new allowances: the isolated pharmacy allowance and the remote pharmacy allowance for pharmacies in isolated and remote areas which have a low number of prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allowances underpin one of the goals of the restructuring program which was to encourage and maintain pharmacies in remote areas. That is an extremely important goal, and I believe that it is appropriate for the government to assist pharmacies to stay in these sorts of areas. People living in remote areas suffer considerable disadvantage when it comes to access to health and other services, and it is certainly appropriate for government to offer some level of assistance to what are essentially private services in order to keep them operating in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for a new professional allowance which will be available to qualified pharmacists for the provision of specific activities not directly related to the supplier of pharmaceuticals. This is where I do have a few concerns which relate back to the earlier problems faced by the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. Nowhere in the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;or, for that matter, in the minister's second reading speech&mdash;does it spell out the circumstances in which this new allowance will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the minister can provide some additional information to this point today during the debate, because it does seem to me that, with the new professional allowance in particular, we are back once again in the land of the vague and the uncertain. We are once again dealing with something where the key criteria are not defined in the legislation and where the rules of the game are going to be set up by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the previous problems in the restructuring process, I just want to add a cautionary note here that such rules&mdash;the criteria for the payment of the professional allowance, in particular&mdash;need to be very clear and very certain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pharmacy Restructuring Authority administered a restructuring program of the industry which saw 639 pharmacies relinquish their approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits&mdash;61 received the amalgamation grant and 578 the closure grant, at a total cost of $42.37 million dollars: $4 million to amalgamation payments and $38.367 million to closure payments.Applications for new pharmacies to obtain a PBS approval was, likewise, tightly monitored, and a stringent criteria had to be satisfied before approval was granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacy restructuring program was designed to achieve a more efficient distribution of pharmacies as well as to cap the rising costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This rationalisation has seen the number of pharmacies Australia-wide reduced from 5,549 to 4,981&mdash;a 10 per cent reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacy industry is currently tightly restricted in all states with ownership of a pharmacy limited to pharmacists, and the number of pharmacies an individual pharmacist can have an interest in is clearly prescribed. In Queensland over 70 per cent of the registered pharmacists have a pecuniary interest in only one pharmacy. It is overwhelmingly an owner-operated industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are strong legitimate reasons which explain why the ownership of pharmacies should be so tightly controlled, and all these reason act to the benefit of the consumer. The primary reason is that `pharmacy' is a profession as well as a business. Pharmacists have a duty of care obligation to their customers, and the usual retail axiom of `buyer beware' does not apply when the health and lives of Australian consumers are potentially at risk if proper advice is not provided by the pharmacist when dispensing pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In exercising this duty of care, the pharmacist must weigh up his professional and ethical obligations to his customer against the commercial considerations of his business; overwhelmingly, this delicate balance will always be in favour of the customer. It is also widely acknowledged that, as well as pharmaceuticals, pharmacists dispense professional advice and counsel on a wide range of minor ailments afflicting their customers, which in many cases removes the necessity of a visit to the GP and reduces pressure on the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The individual accountability of pharmacists is another important argument for maintaining regulations that ensure pharmacists should not have financial interests in more pharmacies than they could personally supervise. Great public benefits clearly flow from the present pharmacy regulations held by all the states. These regulations governing the pharmacy industry would seem to be at odds with the Hilmer national competition recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect will be had on the pharmacy industry by the government's impending national competition legislation based on these recommendations which the government wants to implement by July this year and has been reported in the media as willing to go over the top of the states, if necessary? Hilmer's competition recommendations repeatedly return to his central proposition that `the competitive conduct rules in part IV of the Trade Practices Act should apply uniformly and universally to all business activity, including the professions'. It is further stated that `competitive conduct rules are aimed at protecting the competitive process and thereby avoiding misallocation of resources and inefficiency which adversely affects community welfare'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Hilmer, exemption of particular business, sectors of business or kinds of conduct has the potential to include inefficiency and disadvantage consumers. `There should be no regulatory restriction on competition, unless a public benefit is clearly and transparently demonstrated.' This public benefit exemption would not be granted in perpetuity but would be subject to regular review by an independent body, involve a public inquiry process and include a public assessment of the costs and benefits of the restriction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national competition framework has received bipartisan support in this place and support by all the states. However, our enthusiasm to embrace competition reform as a panacea for our economic woes and a means to boost our economic performance should not come at the expense of full and rational debate on the matter. We must not compliantly embrace a university professor's program of radical change&mdash;no matter how well received, without wide ranging debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until now, the debate has been running all one way as though there were a $22 billion pot of gold at the end of the Hilmer rainbow. But the effects of Hilmer's competition reforms will resonate throughout the economy and the community, and this must be fully canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our haste to reap the economic benefits forecast to flow from competition reform, such as boosting our GDP by $22 billion, as indicated in the media coverage of the leaked Industry Commission report into the effects of the competition reforms, we must not baulk at examining all of the Hilmer propositions, the benefits and the downsides, and the possible adverse consequences that could arise as a result of the sweeping economic change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask ourselves what sort of Australia we want. Do we want every industry sector exposed? At present only the newsagents and the pharmacies are a strong part of the retail sector. Over the last 15 to 20 years we have seen inroads made into all major sectors of the private retail industry. Seventy per cent of the grocery market is controlled by three industries and most other retail industries&mdash;the butcher, the hardware stores, all major private retail industries&mdash;have lost market share to the corporate sector of the retailing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently state legislation quarantines pharmacies from competition from the big retail chains. The chains would say the pharmacy industry is uncompetitive and needs opening up. However, these free enterprise assertions must be weighed up against the fact that our present pharmacy arrangements give Australia one of the best, if not the best, pharmaceutical systems in the world in terms of both the price of pharmaceuticals, which are at half world parity price, and equity and efficiency, in that the distribution of community pharmacies means that all Australians, including those in rural and remote areas, have a reasonable access to a pharmacy or the means to obtain pharmaceuticals within the maximum 24-hour period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are indeed fortunate to live in a country that currently maintains such an equitable, orderly and efficient pharmaceutical and health system. The efficiency of this system is reflected in the total cost of health care of eight per cent of GDP compared with that bastion of deregulation and competition, the United States, which has a huge health bill around 14 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question has to be asked: why would we want to change a system that works so well and so equitably and to the benefit of all Australians in both metropolitan and rural and regional areas simply in order to comply with a radical economic program that in this case we do not know will give any increased benefits? If the regulations governing pharmacy ownership were relaxed by compliant state governments in conformance with the federal government's competition policy, owner-operator pharmacies would be greatly disadvantaged and most, if not all, would lose market share to the retail chains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen, as I said before, the decimation of the small business retail sector. The butcher, the baker, the local corner store, even the larger independent grocery store, and the hardware store, which were once integral elements of our retail landscape, are now greatly reduced in number. The spectre of deregulation is currently looming over newsagents and it seems likely that the 4,500-strong pharmacy industry will be the next retail sector subjected to an economic analysis of its laws and regulations governing ownership. Once one state relaxed or removed its pharmacy ownership controls, the floodgates would be well and truly open and the retail chains would move quickly to grab a share of the pharmaceutical market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three retail chains command 70 per cent of the total grocery retail market and independent pharmacies, particularly those in rural and regional areas, would find it as difficult as the other retailers to compete against the huge buying power that the chains have. Let us be quite certain about this: the three chains are hovering in the wings waiting for the pharmacy ownership to be opened up. Our largest retailer, Woolworths, is on the record stating that once ownership regulations were relaxed it would open 500 dispensaries nationally. Undoubtedly, the other chains would soon follow suit to increase store traffic and compete effectively with Woolworths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the US experience to receive a sobering warning of the potential consequences for the independent pharmacy industry if supermarkets were allowed to open pharmacies. In the United States supermarkets generate around 25 per cent of the total US prescription volume. Supermarkets with pharmacies have a much higher turnover rate than those without pharmacies and a strong trend has emerged showing that most chains build new stores with dispensaries as those without are viewed as uneconomic in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allegations of predatory pricing practices employed by the chains to force the independents out of business are periodically raised in the US. The US journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nard</EMPHASIS> recently reported that a group of independent pharmacies in the mid-west filed predatory pricing charges against retail giant Walmart for selling prescription drugs at 20 per cent below the average wholesale price, an action that was eventually settled out of court. In America, Walmart is the largest US retailer, yet it commands only 2.4 per cent of the total US market. In comparison, Woolworths, our biggest retailer, commands 31 per cent of the total grocery market, Coles-Myer 25 per cent and Franklins 14 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States the largest 10 retail chains dominate 10 per cent of the total US market compared to our three biggest dominating 70 per cent of the grocery market. In the US independents cannot compete against their big retailers in a far less concentrated grocery market than ours. What hope would our independent pharmacies have against the might and massive buying power wielded by our big retail chains?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at the United Kingdom situation, which has a national health dispensing approval system similar to ours. The biggest chain of pharmacies, Boots, has announced that it will increase its market share by 30 per cent over the next two years from 840 pharmacies to 1,080, with a new store opening every 10 days. Boots will open these pharmacies whether it obtains national health approval or not as the chain is able to carry an uneconomic, unapproved pharmacy by means of cross-subsidisation until successful in lobbying the government for an approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UK experience shows that the big pharmacy chains are a very effective lobby in obtaining national health subscription approvals where independent pharmacists have failed. It is difficult to see how the situation would be any different in Australia. Once the Pandora's box of pharmacy regulation was opened, the consequences would be irreversible and, without a doubt, the independents would lose immediate market share, culminating in a greatly reduced pharmaceutical and pharmacy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While pharmacy ownership is a state matter, the Commonwealth, through its function of issuing pharmaceutical benefit approvals, obviously has a major input into the future of the industry. It is well within the Commonwealth's powers to maintain the present pharmaceutical arrangements in all states by giving an undertaking when the new agreement is signed with the Pharmacy Guild that it will not issue pharmaceutical benefit approvals to supermarkets. Such a commitment to the pharmacy industry would be quite consistent with the minister's second reading speech asserting that the number of approved pharmacies is now at the correct level and in view of the $40 million that was spent in an industry restructuring program to achieve that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By approaching this Hilmer report we are now moving towards a change in economic circumstances. Unfortunately, in life the game is not played on computers or on paper; it is played out there in the field. There are a number of issues that do not come up on the computer model. Those are the lives and the futures of Australia's small business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacy industry has been a particularly successful one, advising and dispensing not only pharmaceuticals and drugs but also advice. I do not think that there is anyone in this parliament who would want to see that industry being hurt. I believe that we are facing a problem in Australia at the moment. We are going to deregulate all things for a $22 billion benefit. After allowing many businesses to dominate markets over the last 15 to 20 years, we are going to topple that domination process and bring in deregulation. That will give the three massive chains in Australia tremendous market power and tremendous market domination. I think that has to be looked at very closely before we make any decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 [1995], which will amend the National Health Act of 1953 and give effect to the new pharmacy agreement between the federal government, the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. I will just give a brief overview of what this will mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will actually see the essential pharmacy allowance for pharmacists in rural areas replaced with two separate allowances&mdash;the isolated pharmacy allowance and the remote pharmacy allowance, which will target pharmacies which operate in remote areas, as the name would suggest, and would have a low prescription volume. Other changes will include the cessation of grants to pharmacists who close or amalgamate their pharmacies in line with the pharmacy restructuring agreement and will provide a new professional allowance to qualifying pharmacists for the performance of specific activities not directly related to the supply of pharmaceutical items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes will also see the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority replaced with the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, and I do not think there would be too many pharmacists around Australia who would be sad to see the PRA disappear. The new ACPA will make recommendations to the government on applications for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefit items, the payment of allowances to pharmacists in isolated and remote areas and the payment of allowances for specific professional services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the introduction of this legislation, we are told, the government consulted widely with key industry groups&mdash;the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmaceutical Society. However, it is apparent that it has not consulted with consumer and community groups, which is a very important process for any legislative change such as this. The government needs to find out how this will impact upon the communities of rural and remote areas in Australia&mdash;areas which are already greatly disadvantaged by government policies on health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I view this as a very serious admission, especially considering that last year in the government's national rural health strategy it was stated that, in providing integrated cohesive health services tailored to community needs and developing and implementing rural health strategies, there should be increased community consultation and participation in the planning of rural health services and an integration of the activities of rural health interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further cause for concern is that the new pharmacy agreement, which is due to take effect on 1 April 1995&mdash;of course, it has not yet been signed&mdash;means the government is taking legislative action in anticipation of an outcome. This is not a dissimilar process to that which is occurring with the current health insurance reform legislation. It is objectionable that the government arrogantly treats parliamentary processes as a mere rubber stamp of executive action. Having had witness after witness in the health reform bill area tell us that they have not been consulted, I am not at all surprised that people in rural Australia have not been consulted about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, further mockery is made of the political process when one reads the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this bill. It makes no attempt to explain or understand the bill's provisions. With respect to the amendments in question, I understand that the Pharmacy Guild has welcomed the replacement of the PRA with the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, particularly given that the new authority will have a more independent chairperson. Pharmacists right throughout Australia have been asking for that ever since the PRA came into existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacy board of New South Wales is concerned that this bill does not go far enough to address the additional problems in the area of pharmacy restructuring. These problems principally include the need for branch pharmacies in remote or isolated areas and the problem of leapfrogging where pharmacies have closed and moved from one location to another, creating additional pressure on existing pharmacies in the area. The guild also pointed out that the proposed professional allowance, with a total allocation of $2 million annually, does not go very far when notionally distributed among Australia's pharmacies, which total more than 4,000 nationwide. So no-one really seems to know how that figure has even come into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a need to ensure that, while subsidising pharmacies in rural and isolated areas, there is also prompt access to prescription medicines and drugs in times of need. I have raised this subject many times before, and particularly when so many pharmacies in country areas were closing down a number of years ago and people were actually having to travel hundreds of kilometres to get pharmaceutical services and facilities when their one town pharmacy was closed down. The statistics all point to the disadvantages of which I speak because those people in rural Australia are already gravely disadvantaged when it comes to health matters, and their prompt access to a whole host of medical facilities and services and treatments, including prescription drugs, needs to be assured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article entitled `Rural Health Problems Exposed' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in August last year, it was reported that a paper prepared by the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University on health of rural dwellers had dispelled the myth that life was healthier in the country and found that the government spends less on rural patients than urban ones. People in the country are very much aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that rural dwellers were much more likely to become sick and die earlier and that rural women were the worst off, as they were almost 90 per cent more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza than women in the city. They were also 50 per cent more likely to die in a car crash or from diabetes and tended to be more overweight and smoke more than city women. Other causes of death which have increased markedly in rural people over city people are heart disease, stroke, respiratory problems, general injury, poisoning, and genito-urinary infections, including sexually transmitted disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key differentials is that rural Australia's access to utilisation of specialist health services is far less than for urban Australians. Both male and female rural people tend not to visit a doctor when they suspect that they are ill, and most attribute this to the distance they need to travel to access the service of a general practitioner. That is why it is still significantly important that they have the availability of pharmacists because, in many cases with less serious illnesses, people do go and consult their pharmacies. That is why the closing down of country pharmacies or the inaccessibility of country pharmacies is of great concern to country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this points to a need for an urgent response to the health outcomes of rural Australia. Long-term and short-term actions should include a better, all-round package of health care for Australians in rural and remote areas of this country, especially one which targets Aboriginal people, who are undoubtedly the worst affected by the government's lack of effective rural health strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the introduction to the government's national and rural health strategy of March 1994, all of the problems I have just mentioned plus more are identified. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some health problems such as mental illness, youth suicide, injuries, road trauma, alcohol and substance abuse are most acute in the rural areas and provide ample justification of the need for a specific rural health strategy. Aboriginal communities in particular are characterised by unacceptably high levels of morbidity and mortality. The incidence and prevalence of such problems as ear infections, eye diseases, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular problems, communicable diseases, respiratory disorders, kidney disease and skin infections are often well in excess of those for the wider community.</PARA>

<PARA>The coalition welcomes this review. It points out that, both in terms of legislation and administration, the management of aged care is a morass of bureaucratic regulation. The review makes more than 80 recommendations and suggests sweeping changes to laws governing the aged. It places the emphasis not on regulation but on the outcomes and processes which will enable older people to maintain dignity, independence and control over their lives and quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many senior citizens do not understand their entitlements and do not understand what is required to get into a home. When they do get into a home they are reluctant to complain or demand satisfactory conditions, services and treatment. This report confirms that the federal government's aged care program fails to satisfy the needs of an increasing number of older Australians. The coalition agrees with the general tenor of the report and supports the commission's recommendation that there should be a single aged care act that has a logical structure and is written in plain language. One of the other things about this report is that somebody has now listened to older Australians instead of telling them what is best for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a substantial report of about 300 pages and 80 recommendations. I have not got time in the five minutes available to me to deal with each of those recommendations. However, I will talk about the recommendations relating to consultation and planning. In relation to consultation, the commission recommends that the new legislation should reflect the importance of consultation to the aged care program. Consultation has not been a strong point in the department's handling and government's handling of the aged care portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, and especially under the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), I am being told over and over again by peak bodies and other stakeholders in the industry that it is impossible to get an appointment to see the minister. If by some chance you are lucky enough to get an appointment it is not a consultation but a briefing on what the government intends to do. Genuine and appropriate consultation is a two-way process and it is vital if the best possible outcome for aged people is to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission also recommends that planning should be needs based, should outline the process which should be open,  transparent and flexible, include regular reviews of ratios and set out outcomes for the planning process. The report goes on at length to talk about the need for flexibility in the respite care and residential care areas. The commission also recommends that the legislation should set out outcomes for the assessment process and set out the steps in the assessment process. As I said before, the report talks a number of times about flexibility and emphasises the need for flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission has also suggested quite important changes to the area of domiciliary nursing care benefits. I have not got time to go into all of those recommendations. I welcome wholeheartedly the reforms it suggests. For too long eligibility for the DNCB has relied far too much on physical disability and dependency. The commission has also made a number of recommendations regarding funding&mdash;for example, that funding decisions should be transparent, the legislation should be set out on the grounds on which decisions are made, the conditions attached to the approval should be set out, the applicant's review rights should be outlined, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sometimes forget that when we talk about nursing home residents we are referring to the most vulnerable, non-vocal, least empowered members of the community. It is up to us to ensure that the quality of life is as good as it can be. There is little point in the government revamping the legislation and using the rhetoric of caring when it refuses to fund nursing homes adequately. The three peak nursing home bodies have just issued a press release condemning the government and stating that they have received report after report which shows that the government is not giving sufficient funding to the SAM component of nursing home funding. We can have Law Reform Commission report after Law Reform Commission report, but unless the government addresses this issue it will fail to look after the aged and frail in our community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the report on the next triennium for higher education funding. It is difficult to know where to start because there are so many things to talk about. I will concentrate on four issues of great concern to me. The first relates to the allocation of research funding. The Industry Commission recently brought out a report recommending a change to the allocation mechanism for research funding in universities. The Senate will recall that a committee of the Senate investigated this and brought down a major landmark report last year. We certainly did not recommend what the Industry Commission is recommending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission is saying that we should move research money out of the research quantum&mdash;over $200 million&mdash;and put it into the ARC. More money in the ARC is most welcome because it is a very successful research mechanism. I do not believe this is the way to do it. If you move over $200 million out of the research quantum in universities, what you are going to do is turn the great majority of them into teaching institutions and the money allocated through the ARC will largely go to the big seven. The concentration on research money that we already have in this country&mdash;that is, where two-thirds of the money goes to seven universities&mdash;will be therefore more concentrated under that system, impoverishing the other 19 universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommend that the overall level of funding for research be increased because it is desperately needed. There is not enough money in most of the mechanisms. At the moment, we have, in relation to ARC grants, a success rate of 16 per cent. The evidence before the committee last year showed that that rate should be closer to 40 per cent. The rate has dropped since the report from 19 per cent to 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue in the report that I will mention is the credit transfer arrangements. This is an excellent idea. It has great potential for helping to smooth the articulation of students through the whole system. It has a great capacity, if the government realised it, to save money but it has not progressed very far. We have not progressed far since my sister-in-law transferred 30 years ago, when her husband moved to Queensland, from the University of New South Wales with eight-ninths of a degree to the University of Queensland. She was awarded four-ninths of that degree. She had one unit to go and they told her to go back and do another five units. That is a wasteful use of resources. We should think about the extra lectures, the extra material and the space in the university that was taken up by a student who should not have had to repeat the program. That was 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to credit transfer in this country, even though there has been progress in reports, the actuality, as I discovered with my daughter recently, has not changed at all. She was facing exactly the same problem&mdash;transferring between universities and losing a great deal of the credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final thing I want to talk about is the quality assurance mechanism mentioned in this report. There is some danger and some fear that the $80 million will move out of the university system. There is at the moment a report to the minister on the second round. We are all very anxiously awaiting the outcome of that report. There is considerable fear in the universities that the third round will not occur and that the funding will not be reallocated but, in the budget cuts that are coming, will probably disappear altogether. This would be a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We obviously need to reform quality assurance greatly, but our fear is that the $80 million that should be reallocated to the infrastructure needs of universities, the re-allocation that is needed for extra places, will disappear out of the system entirely. That would be a tragedy for the university sector, which is already considerably under-funded. More money is needed for teaching. More money is needed for research. More money is needed for infrastructure. But if this $80 million quality assurance disappears, situations in the universities will be made much worse. This report before the Senate allows me to underline starkly that after 12 years of Labor rule there are still massive problems in the university sector in this country because the government has not been able to fund this sector adequately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could have made my same remarks on item No. 9, but I want to concentrate on the employment part of this portfolio. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, joins other world leaders at this very moment in Copenhagen at the United Nations summit for social development. The aim of this conference is to explore how millions of strugglers&mdash;not only the traditional poor in third world countries but also the new underclass of out-of-work professionals&mdash;fit into the world which seems increasingly to have left them behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Secretary-General cites research which shows that one out of every 10 people of working age cannot find a decent paying job. He says, `The world is suffering from a social and moral crisis.' Unemployment is one of those misery benchmarks that are used at this conference. Australia still has a very high unemployment rate and we cannot go to that conference thinking that we can lecture to the rest of the world. On its raw figures Australia's unemployment rate is nine per cent and its youth unemployment rate is 27 per cent. But behind those figures lies a deeper, more serious social concern. In raw unemployment terms, that places us behind the United States, Japan, Germany and even our closest neighbour, New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics really highlight the deep social concern we should have in regard to those raw figures. The ABS labour force figures released today show that there are more than 700,000 children under the age of 15 living in families where neither parent has a job; there are over 300,000 children in couple families where neither parent has paid work; and there are near on 400,000 children in one-parent families where that parent does not have paid employment. The statistics released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics also show that some 568,000 Australians were or considered themselves underemployed. The serious social ramifications in those figures are quite obvious to both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, a trend in December and January has quite clearly shown the number of part-time or casual employed. For example, in the December figures&mdash;and this trend continued in the January figures&mdash;while the employment rate increased ever so slightly, for which the government took great kudos, the information behind those figures shows that the increase was really due to some 62,100 part-time jobs, and that was leading up to Christmas. So the vulnerability and the uncertainty in the workplace still exists. In that month of December full-time employment actually fell by some 18,000 jobs. As I said, that trend continued in January. That is a very concerning trend, particular in regard to youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The University of Adelaide's Centre for Labour Studies issued a report last month which said that the trend is set to continue beyond the year 2000, particularly in the youth market.

The first is to record with great sadness the death last week of Mr Justice Brian Treyvaud of the Family Court of Australia. Justice Treyvaud was not an intimate friend of mine, but I did become acquainted with him during the time that I was chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. It was about that time I first met Justice Treyvaud that he became a member of the Family Law Council of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found Mr Justice Treyvaud to be a very decent human being and a very likeable individual in the brief contact that I had with him.

This was also true of him in the more general sphere of life. He was a great human being in the limited contact I had with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reason for speaking in the chamber of a person whom I did not know intimately is that of the shock his death brought to me. It was only last Thursday night that Senator Cooney, my wife and Mr Justice Treyvaud had a meal in the dining room of this house. So it was, as you would appreciate, Mr Acting Deputy President, quite a shock when I found out on Monday morning from Senator Cooney that Justice Treyvaud had died. I take this opportunity to extend my condolences and my wife's condolences to Mr Justice Treyvaud's wife Joy and to his children. I have met Joy, but I have not met his children. I know Senator Cooney wants to say much more about Mr Justice Treyvaud because he obviously knew him much more intimately than I did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to put on the record tonight the text of a press statement that I issued on 2 March entitled `Interdiction may have to be considered'. The reason for taking this unusual approach to my press statement is that it has received quite an inordinate degree of attention as far as I am concerned. All through yesterday and today I have received requests from members of the opposition in the other place for a copy of the statement. I have also had numerous requests through the parliamentary library for a copy of this statement.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia will have to consider implementing a policy of interdiction and turning boats around at sea if the Bill relating to China's One Child Policy is defeated. The Bill is currently before the Parliament" Western Australian Labor Senator Jim McKiernan said today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator McKiernan was commenting on the Coalition Senator's dissenting reports to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee report on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill No. 3 (1995). The Opposition Senators' were joined in dissent by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Democrats, and Independent Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I appreciate that interdiction would be a most serious step to take and should only be considered as a last resort, but the Government will have to consider it if the Bill is lost. I would anticipate that hundreds of thousands of people from China and some other Asian countries will shortly be making plans to get to Australia. They will hear, if they have not already heard, that the numbers are in the Senate to defeat the Bill".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This serious action, which would have a negative effect on Australia's International reputation can be avoided if the Opposition Leader, Mr Howard acts immediately, decisively and positively. His first action should be to sack his spokesman on Immigration, Senator Jim Short. While Senator Short did not sign the dissenting report, he was involved in it's development".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Mr Howard must also act to neutralise the influence that the secretive National Civic Council has on his Party. The NCC influence has already caused his Party to make an embarrassing backdown on the Compensation Bill (Migration Amendment Bill No.3 [1994]) which was passed this week in the House of Representatives, after it had been defeated in the Senate last year".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Turning boats, that carry illegal migrants to Australia, around as sea, may be the only way to stop the flood gates opening and protect Australia in the long term. The antics of a leaderless, but power hungry Coalition in opposing responsible legislation, is sending a message that Australia is a soft touch".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Irresponsible decisions in our Courts, and I refer particularly to Mr Justice Sackville's decision of November last year, which expanded the definition of Refugee Status, has embellished the view that Australia is an easy target for those who profit by providing passage for boat people".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The mixed messages coming from the Australian representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Australia is also of great concern. Mr Fontaine is publicly contradicted between his evidence to the Senate Committee and personal correspondence which found its' way to the media".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Outrageous statements from NCC inspired asylum support groups that distort the aims and objectives of the Bill and Government policy, are further exaggerated and given credence in the media. This further compounds and confuses the signals being sent to Asia. People who want a better life will, in their thousands, maybe tens of thousands, make their way illegally to Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"How can Australia stop people who already have two and in some cases three children, making claims for refugee status based on China's One Child Policy?".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"How can Australia stop illegals blocking up our Court system (after they have failed to gain refugee status), if there is an army of lawyers prepared to give them FREE legal advice and representation?".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Can Australia limit the availability of free legal representation to illegals from the various Legal Aid Commissions of Australia?".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Can the Legal Aid Commissions justify expending scarce resources on illegals when they continually complain that they have insufficient funds to meet the demands on these resources from Australians who are lawful and legal in this country?".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Stopping the illegals landing in the first instance would be one way of solving these problems, but this action should not even be considered until Mr Howard is given an opportunity to put things right in his own Party. If he puts Australia and the Australian taxpayer's interests before those of the illegal boat people, pledges support and passage of the Government's Bill, then the last ditch action of interdiction need not be considered.</PARA>

William Brian Treyvaud, a Justice of the Family Court, died in Melbourne on Friday, 3 March 1995. The fact that on the previous evening, as Senator McKiernan has already pointed out, he had been a delightful and apparently fit dinner companion for Senator McKiernan, Jackie Watkins and me here in Canberra shows the suddenness of his death.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Brian in the common law courts. He was a considerable advocate, whether addressing a jury or judge alike. The number of verdicts he won shows the truth of that statement. Many more personal injury cases ended in settlement than in judgment.

It is a sinister exercise designed to mislead the public of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since coming to this chamber I have had the opportunity to visit a number of schools in New South Wales, particularly to represent the federal Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) at the opening of new facilities at those schools. What is abundantly clear is that the New South Wales government is seeking to use these openings to mislead the public into thinking that it is solely and totally responsible for the provision of these facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me cite two recent instances. On 23 February I attended the opening of some new facilities at the Kurnell Public School in Sydney. As I approached the school that morning, I found there was a large sign outside the school which said `The New South Wales government&mdash;building better schools'. But what are the facts? The facts are that the total cost of those new facilities was of the order of $1.4 million and of that amount $1.1 million was contributed by the Commonwealth government. Seventy-eight per cent of the total construction cost of those facilities was contributed by the federal government but very little, if any, acknowledgment was given by the state government at the opening. In fact, a sign, as I said, outside the school said that it is the New South Wales government which is building better schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 March, last Friday, I attended the opening of new library facilities at Cobar High School. These facilities were opened by the New South Wales Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who gave a very grudging acknowledgment of a cooperative approach, as she said, with respect to the provision of these facilities. But, again, what are the facts? What did the minister not tell the people there? What was not told was that the entire construction cost of that new library, $388,000, was contributed by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the state of New South Wales in the months of February and March in the lead-up to the state election this scenario is being repeated almost on a daily basis. The Premier of New South Wales and his minister for education are running around the state opening up schools and TAFE colleges that have been overwhelmingly funded by Commonwealth government funds. Over 72 per cent of the capital costs of these schools and colleges is being met by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more sinister than not revealing the real sources of this funding is the timing of these openings. In the month of February and March 1995 but prior to the state election on 25 March, new facilities in 45 schools will be opened in New South Wales&mdash;45! As I said, the overwhelming proportion of the funds is being contributed by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought to myself that maybe it has something to do with the fact that the school year starts in the end of January and that there might be some coincidence here in terms of the timing of the opening of these new facilities and the school year. So I checked for the same two months of last year, February and March of 1994, and what did I find? How many new facilities were opened in New South Wales schools in February and March of last year? One new facility was opened. One new facility was opened in February and March of 1994, and 45 were opened in February and March of 1995. </PARA>

In some of the cases, the facilities at those schools have been finished and operational for many months. In fact, at the Lucas Heights Community School, which is near where I live, the project was finished in 1993. The school was opened on 22 February this year.

Let us not forget that the federal government has very little say as to whether a coupe is logged or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day Senator Collins pointed this out in the Senate in answer to a question. He likened the federal government's power over woodchipping to having hold of the tail of a dog.

The federal government does not have it, and neither does the federal minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very cynical exercise to buy green votes. It could subsequently mean that the areas that are presently protected will not be protected after the New South Wales election. This parliament has seen such political opportunism, such shoddy policy making and such a shambles that threatens to throw into turmoil the lives of 30,000 timber workers in New South Wales and about 85 timber workers Australia-wide. This week's decision is a complete about-face by the Commonwealth on the south-east forests agreement signed only in December 1993. In essence, it is a regional forest agreement of the type provided for under the national forest policy statement. You would have thought that the cabinet would have come up with a better excuse than deficient state government assessments.

If the Minister for Resources is right and if his claims are accurate, why did Senator Collins not raise these concerns about the nature of the information the New South Wales government provided through the nine telephone calls he had with the responsible New South Wales minister, the Hon. George Souris, during the last two weeks? Why were these concerns not raised and these issues discussed at the meeting held between the Commonwealth and the state officials in Sydney on 13 and 14 February? How can the government possibly claim that its decision, which will affect the jobs of hundreds of workers according to the union&mdash;the CFMEU&mdash;has been made because of anything other than political reasons?

Asset Services, like its private competitors, does not pay sales tax when undertaking Commonwealth Government work. Asset Services does not pay or make allowance for State payroll taxes, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax and stamp duty when undertaking work for the Commonwealth Government. However, the impact of these taxation arrangements on the competitive position of Asset Services cannot be assessed in isolation from a range of other factors. For example, as part of a Commonwealth Department Asset Services does not have access to various industry assistance programs that are potentially available to its competitors. Successive studies have demonstrated that when all major differences in the operating circumstances of Asset Services and its competitors are taken into account, including taxation factors, Asset Services operates at a net competitive disadvantage in bidding for Commonwealth Government work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There have been no national studies to investigate the effects of the distribution of free and low cost supplies of infant formula on breastfeeding rates in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent national studies of breastfeeding rates indicate that the rates are generally high at discharge from hospital (about 85 percent) but these rates decrease rapidly following discharge, falling to about 40 percent at six months of age.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cessation of free and subsidised supplies is within the jurisdiction of the States and Territories and it is inappropriate for the Commonwealth to do more than encourage the States and Territories to adopt best practice in their provision of health services. It has urged the States and Territories to take action to cease these supplies by bringing this matter to their attention through correspondence and placing the issue on the agenda of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC). A meeting of all concerned parties was also convened by my Department and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs in November 1993 to discuss this issue. Western Australia and Tasmania support the cessation of free and subsidised supplies and are planning to take some action to stop their acceptance and use in the health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Act prevents the infant formula companies from collectively agreeing to a suitable price at which to sell infant formula supplies to health units, however two infant formula manufacturers have taken unilateral action to cease free and subsidised supplies&mdash;one in only maternity hospitals and the other in all hospitals.</PARA>
