<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chamarette moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion of censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) in relation to the use of Land Fund money.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking to the contingency of that, I believe that it does need to be debated. It probably needed to be debated earlier this week, but I felt that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, in particular should have an opportunity to retract his statement and, similarly, so should the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be no surprise to the minister. The reason for our support is that this chamber spent an enormous amount of time debating this legislation. As Senator Collins and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) would remember, I think it was the second or third longest debate in the history of this parliament. The issues that are contained in the motion moved by the Greens (WA), and Senator Chamarette in particular, were issues that were canvassed by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearings when the bill was first introduced here. They were then debated during the lengthy committee stage and second reading debate on the bill. They were then debated and discussed during the hearings around Australia of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill which I chaired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns were raised about these issues and the government defended its scheme for creating two land funds instead of one as a transitional measure. They were warned by a range of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal witnesses and lobbyists throughout that lengthy debate, which ranged from about October until March this year, that just what has occurred would occur. It is therefore a matter that the Senate needs to deal with as a matter of urgency. Therefore, the motion for the suspension of standing orders will be very happily supported by coalition senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion for the suspension of standing orders is to enable Senator Chamarette to move a motion censuring the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins). I listened carefully to what Senator Collins said. His opposition to this motion appeared to be based on his concern about the ability of the government to meet the terms of the return to order. That is another issue altogether. Quite frankly, I do not see, on the face of it, why the government, with its army of public servants, cannot observe the obligations that are imposed upon it by the parliament to produce those documents in the public interest. But that is another issue altogether. It has nothing to do with this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be concerned if Senator Collins did not know that there was a censure motion coming forward. But, as has been indicated by Senator Campbell, this matter has been discussed both in committees and in the Senate chamber. It would concern me if the minister did not know that he was going to face a censure motion because, to me, that would be a question of natural justice. The minister knew some two weeks ago that there would be a censure motion. In fact, everybody else seemed to know. I hope Senator Collins was not implying that he did not know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate censures the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) for misleading the Senate and the people of Australia over the use of Land Fund money available through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) when:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)on 11 May 1995, Senator Bob Collins said that Senator Campbell was wrong to say that $20 million out of $24 million had been allocated for land acquisition in the Northern Territory and asserted that `the principal issue is that $42 million is available to ATSIC for land acquisition, Senator, not $21 million',thereby seeking to represent ATSIC's decision in a better, but inaccurate, light;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)on 9 November 1994 Senator Gareth Evans stated that `the Government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the Land Rights Act. . . ', when the decision by ATSIC will cause a dramatic increase in the amount of land claimed under the Native Title Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)an ATSIC Board Briefing Paper now reveals that an agreement had been struck between the Prime Minister, ATSIC and a group of `indigenous Land Fund Bill negotiators' about singling out the Northern Territory for special treatment over the next 2 years for land acquisitions from ATSIC's land acquisition and land maintenance program.</PARA>
<PARA>On 11 May 1995, in answer to my question without notice about the decision by ATSIC to allocate $20 million to the Northern Territory for land acquisition, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very surprised that the dynamics did not work out in order to provide for more equitable distribution. I think that is a ground for concern. Senator Collins said he was concerned about that news. I certainly say that I am concerned about it and I will certainly be seeking some further information.</PARA>
<PARA>That was nearly three weeks ago. Since then, despite the fact that we are into the third sitting day following the fine words of Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins, neither has felt any compulsion to return to this chamber and provide a fuller explanation of the ATSIC decision. Senator Collins needs to more fully explain the statements he made in vitriolic fashion on 11 May, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that less than half of the money available to ATSIC for land acquisition has been used for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins knew that it was $20 million out of the possible $24 million available to ATSIC for land acquisition that was to be used for purchasing land in the Northern Territory. The Leader of the Government in the Senate does need to explain what he meant on 9 November last year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He did say `agreed'. If you read the debate at that time, you would know that that statement was made in response to concerns about how much land would be able to be purchased in the territory prior to the Northern Territory land rights cut-off coming into action. It is very clear what the leader meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that our criticisms in the debate were in the context that, if there really was a billion dollar land fund, if there really was an adequate amount available for land purchases throughout Australia for those Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed by the 200 years of settlement, there could be no quibble with this particular allocation. What we must remember is that the ATSIC land acquisition and management funding is only half of the total indigenous land fund, or the so-called billion dollar fund, that is available for administration, acquisition and management. When this section of it is so largely used in the Northern Territory, it is clearly inequitable to the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, that is clearly what Senator Collins and the Leader of the Government meant when they were speaking. They knew that that was inaccurate information. Here we are, three weeks since the issue was raised in this place, and the government has done nothing to fully explain the circumstances of the ATSIC decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is not enough reason to bring on the censure motion today, let us look at why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should also be censured and, in his turn, the Leader of the Government, again, for misleading the Senate, for hiding from the Senate that there was a secret agreement between a small favoured group of Aboriginal people, ATSIC and the government about giving special treatment to the Northern Territory for the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This secret agreement was vehemently denied in this place by Senator Collins and Senator Evans. Yet now we have the ATSIC briefing paper that was circulated to all of the commissioners in preparation for them to make their decision on the distribution of land fund money riddled with references to agreements with indigenous Land Fund Bill negotiators and in line with discussions with government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, last Friday during estimates we had ATSIC, with the help of the duty minister and the chair of the committee, attempting to block questioning about the decision and about the briefing paper. Mr Morony from ATSIC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not sure that it is appropriate that I discuss a confidential board paper and the recommendations contained in it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time I stated that it was a very valuable time to answer those questions when all the departmental advisers were there. However, that opportunity was not taken. That also lay beneath the request for appropriate documentation. That will be part of a call to order later on, not as part of this debate. It is the deadline for that that has possibly confused the minister because it is at 5 o'clock today that those documents are requested. We will deal with the matter of changes to that during the debate to deal with the call to order, but I thank my colleagues for realising the seriousness and urgency of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the motion says, on 9 November 1994, Senator Evans stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Now, six months later, we are here debating the decision by ATSIC to provide over 80 per cent of all the money it is setting aside for land acquisition for the next two years to purchases in the Northern Territory. This will cause a dramatic increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act. Yet the Leader of the Government, when challenged about this decision by me two weeks ago, did not apologise to the Senate, and since then he has made no attempt to return to this place and fully explain the circumstances of the ATSIC decision. In fact, all he did was protest that he thought it does call for an explanation from ATSIC. It certainly does, and it calls for an explanation from the government. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not know whether there are any other understandings or agreements lying behind this.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet Senator Evans then bravely went on to argue that his expectation was that the distribution of land fund moneys would take a relatively even pattern of distribution of the funding rather than it all being concentrated in the Northern Territory. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think it is a matter of formal undertaking. I cannot recall&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is a very familiar phrase in Western Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">any such agreements or undertakings being entered into, but it was certainly a matter of expectation.</PARA>
<PARA>How can that be? ATSIC's expectation would appear to be quite the opposite. Throughout the briefing paper that was written by the ATSIC bureaucracy to provide options to the ATSIC commissioners for the decision on the distribution of ATSIC land fund moneys for the next two years, the core assumption is that there be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">special treatment for the Northern Territory with respect to land acquisitions from ATSIC's</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">land acquisition and management program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in line with discussions with the government and the restrictions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Two pages later, when arguing against option 3, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This option contains the greatest difficulties for the parallel programs in that if ATSIC were to prioritise land management, the Northern Territory would have very little access to historical levels of land acquisition funding. The rationale for having parallel programs is therefore lost, which is the basis of the Prime Minister's agreement with indigenous land fund bill negotiators.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how many people were aware that there were land fund bill negotiators. We knew there were for the Native Title Bill but the understanding was that the land fund bill was receiving widespread consultation throughout Australia&mdash;in fact, the most widespread consultation, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arguing for option 1, the author of this briefing document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory traditional owners would lose rights resulting from the rest of indigenous people gaining access to land acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very strange statement, which I am still to fully comprehend. However, in the light of these statements, the government therefore needs to answer some very serious questions. I do not particularly care who answers them; it might be that the Leader of the Government might like to provide the answers or Senator Collins or perhaps ATSIC during the supplementary estimates hearings. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the reasons I am moving this censure motion today. It is a very serious censure because what underlies it is potentially nearly two years of deceit, dishonesty and possibly many years of manipulation of Aboriginal organisations by this government through ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not come into this parliament concerned about ATSIC and the role that it plays in Aboriginal affairs. That is something I had to learn. However, through my experiences during the native title debate, and then more recently through the land fund saga, I have almost lost all faith in ATSIC's ability to do the right thing by its constituency. Please remember its constituency; it is Aboriginal people right throughout Australia, people who are supposedly represented at a regional level and at a community level and for whom the ATSIC board is expected to make decisions in all their interests, not in selective interests and not to work for a government agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sufficient reason to look at why the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government should also be censured because there have clearly been deals and secret agreements going on that give special favoured treatment to those people who are prepared to support government legislation and to succeed in manipulating decisions in order to assist the government in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not being critical here of many regional councillors, regional councils, bureaucrats or even many commissioners. What I am concerned about is the way ATSIC is used to silence the critics of this government's policies. I also want to point out that I do not even begrudge Northern Territory Aboriginal people any piece of land or any funding they can get, except when this is gained at the expense of Aboriginal people elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by ATSIC provides Northern Territory Aboriginal people with at least double the percentage of funding they would normally receive for land acquisition. Normally the Northern Territory would get around 14 per cent of all funds available for land. The ATSIC proposal for the next two years will give the Northern Territory over 30 per cent of all land fund money, either through ATSIC or the new ILC, if the current ratio of land acquisition to management is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would stress that in this place we have just passed a land fund bill which for the next two years splits the money equally between the Indigenous Land Corporation and the ATSIC land acquisition and management program which has already been in existence. The Indigenous Land Corporation gained $24 million a year; the ATSIC land management program continued to receive $21 million a year. By the decision of the ATSIC board, the Northern Territory has received $20 million of the $24 million available for land acquisition funding from ATSIC over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not received a satisfactory answer from Senator Gareth Evans as to what percentage of the management funding&mdash;that is, $18 million of the ATSIC land fund&mdash;is going to the Northern Territory in addition to that. Even if it is a small proportion of management funding&mdash;which I doubt because I understand that landholdings in the Northern Territory are considerable in comparison with the rest of the country&mdash;there is no doubt whatsoever that $20 million of $24 million for land acquisition in the Northern Territory will produce exceedingly strong demands on any management funding available through the Indigenous Land Corporation in future years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be&mdash;and it is certainly stated in information we have received about the ATSIC board meeting, which includes a statement by its chair&mdash;that the ATSIC board has recommended that the Northern Territory not receive any Indigenous Land Corporation funding for the next two years. I should not be sarcastic and say that that is generous, but I do think it is a debatable point. It does show that the board knew that there was an inequity when it made the decision and that it had to balance it by saying that the Northern Territory should not be a beneficiary of Indigenous Land Corporation funding for acquisition. The board said nothing about how it would, of necessity, have to be a beneficiary of the management component of the Indigenous Land Corporation funds, not just in the next two years but for the conceivable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I wish to highlight how serious this matter is. It needs to be dealt with to the fullest possible extent. There are very serious questions that deserve to be answered by the Leader of the Government and by Senator Bob Collins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, might I respond initially to Senator Chamarette's censure motion by saying it is utterly without substance or justification for reasons that I will explain at the outset and Senator Bob Collins will no doubt want to add further to. Let us go back for a start to what was actually said during the debate on the land fund bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a matter of public record at that time&mdash;no ifs, buts or maybes&mdash;that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had given a commitment to the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Perron, that the allocation of `new moneys' should not be used on the purchase of leases in the Northern Territory which could be converted to inalienable freehold under the Northern Territory land rights act. That fact was freely acknowledged by both Senator Collins and me during the debate. Indeed, Senator Chamarette's censure motion includes that specific quote, or part of it, from me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also freely acknowledged in the debate that by including section 121U in the bill the government had not given any undertaking, nor had it intended&mdash;notwithstanding what Mr Perron might have wanted&mdash;that the 1997 cut-off in the land rights act would, in effect, be brought forward by preventing or limiting the amount of land that ATSIC could acquire in the Northern Territory before that time. Purchases in the Northern Territory by ATSIC during the phasing-out period were clearly contemplated and the possibility of them occurring was clearly acknowledged by all those involved in the debate. Mr Perron was under no illusions whatsoever about the government's position in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wanting to go into the semantics of all this, I point out that the claim that ATSIC is now giving 80 per cent of the money available for land purchases for this purpose misrepresents the situation. The fact is that, as I have already said in answer to a question from Senator Chamarette, ATSIC had $42 million available to it over the next two years for land acquisition and land management combined from the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been the case, and will be over the next two years, that it is a matter for the board of ATSIC to determine what the split should be between acquisition on the one hand and management on the other. The fact is that the board has decided to spend: $18 million on land management all over Australia; $20 million&mdash;less than 50 per cent of the total $42 million&mdash;on land acquisition in the Northern Territory; and $4 million in land acquisition elsewhere. In that respect, I can only repeat what I said on 21 March during the debate on the bill: ATSIC is an independent authority; it makes its own decisions about how it spends its land acquisition and its management funds. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I said on 9 November in response to a particular amendment was this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government opposes this amendment. I think the background to it is well known. The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new monies to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act, although pastoral leases purchased by the corporation will be eligible for conversion to native title under section 47 of the Native Title Act. There are no barriers to land acquired by ATSIC being claimed under the land rights act prior to the cut-off date for claims, which is 1997. This is just a matter of getting a responsible balance between the competing claims and interests here. We are not prepared to allow the potential for open slather on conversions to inalienable freehold prior to the cut-off for claims. On that basis we oppose this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be remembered that already nearly 40 per cent of land in the Northern Territory is held by Aboriginal people under inalienable title under the provisions of the land rights act in the Northern Territory. It is against that background and in that context that this particular limitation has been introduced. It is obviously a reasonably sensitive issue, not only as between the Commonwealth and the territory government but also with the Aboriginal people themselves. It is one of those provisions that have been seen to be a reasonable compromise between the competing claims and interests that are involved. Accordingly, we recommend the clause to the Senate in its present form and oppose the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said in November, and that is the full context of the statement that is quoted today by Senator Chamarette. We can see clearly what it is about. What I said on 21 March was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not our expectation that ATSIC will do anything other than maintain the normal pattern of land acquisition using those funds available to it. ATSIC is an independent authority and makes its own decisions about this matter. But I do not believe there is any basis for thinking that the kind of strategy outlined by Senator Ellison will be pursued. There are far too many other people around the country with competing interests who would be far too upset for that to happen. I think we can rely on good sense prevailing in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA>A little further on, in response to Senator Ellison asking, `Would the main aim be to provide as wide a spread as possible?', I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think everything hangs on the `as possible'. There is a sense in which we have to leave it to the ILC's discretion. Situations vary enormously around the country. To talk about an even spread, it begs a lot of questions that need to be answered by the board. I hope it will be equitable and balanced but how that is best done depends on the combination of national and regional strategies that emerge. There will be a consultative process associated with that and I hope, again, that good sense will prevail. We expect it will.</PARA>
<PARA>It was because I had that expectation that there would be that kind of spread generated by the ordinary internal dynamics of the board that I said what I did, but I made it absolutely clear that it was a matter for the board's discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why I was a little bit puzzled when things unfolded as they did without me knowing anything at all about any further background to the decision is because the board had obviously decided, as a result of its own internal processes, to concentrate most of the money available in the next two years that was not going to be spent on land management in the Northern Territory. The board did that for what obviously were perceived by the majority of the board members as good and sufficient reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the nub of Senator Chamarette's allegations that there is some kind of deal involved here which would unfairly benefit Aboriginal organisations in the Northern Territory to the detriment of those in other parts of Australia, it really becomes pretty obvious that her propositions are quite illogical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain why they are. The ILC, newly established, will have $73 million available to it in the two-year period to which the ATSIC decision relates, that is, $25 million from 1994-95 and $24 million for each of 1995-96 and 1996-97 which cannot be used to purchase leases for conversion to inalienable freehold in the Northern Territory under the Northern Territory land rights act. That ought to be clear enough. That is $73 million which, whatever else they can spend it on, certainly cannot be spent in the Northern Territory for the issue that is the nub of concern here, that is to say, the purchase of leases for conversion to inalienable freehold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATSIC board, moreover, has specifically recommended, we understand, that the board of the ILC not approve any land purchases for the Northern Territory over the next two years. While I am obviously reluctant, in the light of various events, to make any predictions at all about the future, I would certainly hope that the ILC will, in considering how it spends its funds over the next two years, focus its attention on land purchases in other parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a rational decision for the ATSIC board to have come to in the terms that it did. Only three of the 19 commissioners, as I understand it, on the ATSIC board at the time of the decision were from the Northern Territory. That in itself stands in stark contrast to the suggestion here that they were voting for a proposition that was somehow against the interests of their constituents. It beggars belief that that is so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no deal of which I am aware that has any bearing on this at all. Senator Bob Collins has been more intimately involved in all these matters than I have, but I am not aware of anything that is remotely relevant here. The issue of how much money would be spent by ATSIC in the Northern Territory was canvassed on a number of occasions during debate on the land fund bill, and I have already referred to those particular contributions that I made to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Chamarette's question on this matter on 11 May, I indicated that I did not know whether there were any other understandings or agreements about the way ATSIC was to distribute the $21 million. As far as I was concerned, there was an expectation that there would be a relatively even pattern of distribution, but beyond that I had no knowledge of the background to that&mdash;and I still have no knowledge. Again, I can only say that this is a matter for determination by the board itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may well be concern being expressed by the land councils in other parts of the country, and Senator Chamarette has made reference to that, but ATSIC is a representative body and its decisions must be assumed to take account of those interests. The chairperson, Ms O'Donoghue, issued a press release in April explaining some of the factors which the board took into account in coming to its decision. I understand that Senator Chamarette pursued some of these issues in estimates committee hearings on 26 May. I have not seen the text of those exchanges myself. But there it is. The matter speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it surprises me that Senator Chamarette is so concerned about the ATSIC decision. During the debate on the bill, it might be recalled, she moved amendments to remove the provision which gave effect to the Prime Minister's agreement with Mr Perron that ILC money should not be spent on claimable land in the Northern Territory and in fact condemned that agreement. The one element in the bill which limited the amount of money that could be spent in the Northern Territory she actually sought to remove. Yet she is now accusing the government, on the one hand, of secretly agreeing with the Northern Territory Aboriginals to get around the very agreement that she herself vigorously opposed; on the other hand, she is manipulating decisions within ATSIC to support or substantiate deals made between the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, a proposition which is simply incredible on the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all I can say on this matter. I have no further knowledge of the internal dynamics of the ATSIC board decision and what may have prompted the balance of judgments that were concerned. Senator Bob Collins may well wish to say something further on that subject, but in terms of what I have said to the Senate, in the context in which I have said it, I think the record makes absolutely clear that there is no question whatsoever of misleading the Senate. This censure motion is utterly misconceived and ought to be dealt with accordingly. </PARA>

He then repeated wads of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which effectively supported Senator Chamarette's motion. On a number of occasions in October questions were raised by a number of senators at various committee meetings and in the committee of the whole debate in the chamber about what could happen in the Northern Territory as a result of the scheme of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). These questions were responded to by Mr Dillon, the minister and Senator Bob Collins saying that we had nothing to worry about and that this could not happen because ATSIC had all of those other priorities. `Don't worry, that is not the purpose of the scheme. It is a transitional period.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked how they could expect senators and the broader Australian community to believe that it took three years to establish a new land fund when they already had one established in ATSIC. I remember mentioning how the Australian Securities Commission took six weeks to move from the old cooperative scheme to the centralised ASC scheme which deals with far more clients than the ILC will ever have to deal with. The claim that Minister Collins made in that debate was a joke. It was unbelievable; it was incredible. It was simply not credible that it required three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We argued at the time that, on the government's own evidence, it would spend in excess of $3 million on administration of the new ILC. We said that, if you wanted to ensure Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders benefited from this scheme by owning some land at some stage, you would ensure that as many millions of dollars as possible would go into purchasing land, not paying the salaries of more bureaucrats by way of administrative expenditure. Senator Evans then talked about how the worst had happened in their eyes and assured us that ATSIC would act in a balanced way by meeting its priorities across Australia and by not spending the majority of funds available to ATSIC over the next couple of years in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite their assumptions that ATSIC would behave with justice and fairness to Aboriginals across Australia when it came to land acquisition and management matters, ATSIC decided to spend $20 million out of the $24 million allocated to land acquisition in this year's budget. That is okay because the Indigenous Land Corporation will have $73 million to purchase land across the rest of Australia, and ATSIC had asked the ILC not to spend any of that money in the Northern Territory. That is fictitious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans would suggest to us that $73 million will be available for land acquisition across Australia. He has misled the Senate, just as Senator Collins did in question time in budget week. That $73 million will not be available for purchase of land across Australia. I will give one good reason&mdash;Senator Harradine knows what I am about to say. When we proposed that the government allocate an extra $3 million for administration expenses it said, `That would not be enough for administration. We do not want the ILC board to be constrained by such a harsh, unconscionable cap on its administration expenses.' So $3 million will not be enough for administration. It may well not be enough in the first year, let alone the out years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three years 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97, at least $9 million of the $73 million that Senator Evans has referred to most likely will go to administration. So approximately $64 million will be available to the ILC for land acquisition and management, and its other functions. We would expect, if all this money is going into the Northern Territory over the next two years, that some of that $64 million that remains may be spent on management and other activities such as education&mdash;and a range of other activities that the ILC is empowered to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans is now saying, `That is fair enough because ATSIC has asked the ILC board to do this.' The further problem with Senator Evans's justification of this is that the ILC board should not be and will not be constrained by some decision taken by ATSIC on the casting vote of the chairman, Lois O'Donoghue. ATSIC has said to the ILC, `We ask you to do this.'</PARA>

Therefore, he may plead with the ILC board. Lois O'Donoghue is on that board, as are a number of other people who have close links to ATSIC. They will use their powers of persuasion, which I am sure Lois and David have, to convince the ILC board that it should not spend any money in the Northern Territory on acquisition or management, even though we will see $20 million in land purchases in the Northern Territory in the next two years. They will say that no ILC money should be spent&mdash;that is, if Senator Evans is to be believed. I put it to the Senate that we cannot believe him on these issues. He may be earnest but we cannot believe what he says because he is saying that out of all the money the ILC has available, in three financial years not a lousy cent will be spent on management in the Northern Territory; it will be spent everywhere else or it will be spent on land acquisition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indisputable fact is that, of course, that is exactly what will occur. That is the reason that the Green senators, Senator Harradine, coalition senators, the Chief Minister and Steve Hatton, the Minister for Aboriginal Development in the Northern Territory, all raised these concerns.

They were concerns that Senator Collins shared, because he goes on ad nauseam about the sort of problems that can occur in the Northern Territory with a massive transfer of Northern Territory land into inalienable freehold. That is a debate that has gone on over and over. We do not want to debate that here today. But the reality is that these were problems which were raised by a range of people.

But Senator Collins is saying that that is okay because they did not have to spend $20 million in the next two years, they could have spent $40 million. They could have spent $42 million, all buying up the Northern Territory. That is a possibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting what was said by no lesser figure than David Ross, the new chairman of the Indigenous Land Corporation, in relation to management in response to a question from Senator Chamarette in relation to the sensible balance between acquisition and management during a hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Senator Chamarette was advocating during that debate that more money be spent on acquisition than on management. That is something I disagree very strongly with her on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Ross makes the point that of course management is a crucial part of any land acquisition and management program. There is no use buying up large tracts of land anywhere in Australia unless the Aboriginal people who hold those lands can be assured of having ongoing financial support&mdash;and some of that must indeed come from the Commonwealth and other governments&mdash;to ensure that those properties remain viable, that their communities as a result of that remain viable and that their economic, social and cultural wellbeing is enhanced as a result of those programs. That is something which I think there is absolute cross-partisan support for in this chamber. Mr Ross actually reveals the sorts of demands on ATSIC's land acquisition management program funds, and that will of course be on the ILC in terms of funding that is available to it, when he says, `On this year's figures alone we probably need somewhere in the order of $15 million for land management.' That is $15 million out of an annual budget in the order of $20-odd million. He states, `We have decided not to put $15 million out of ATSIC's funds into land management. For this financial year we have put in $8 1/2 million.' He is talking about the then financial year. He also states, `We are quite a deal short. Maybe the ILC will look favourably at topping up the land management funds.' So again he quite sensibly stresses the importance of money going into land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term problem that will be created by the government's deception and the deception by both the minister in the chamber, Senator Collins, and his leader, Senator Gareth Evans, is that, if we put this massive distortion of funds into one part of Australia, albeit a very large part of Australia and a very large part of Aboriginal Australia, and therefore, in terms of acquisition over the next two years, deprive those Aboriginal people living in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, which you should never forget in terms of Aboriginal land needs, New South Wales and the Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;and we can try to justify it as Senator Gareth Evans did by saying, `There will be $64 million available for land acquisition and management for the rest of Australia during that period'&mdash;we will distort forever the balance in terms of equity and the raw square metres or square kilometres owned or controlled by Aboriginal people in one part of Australia. We will therefore create a distortion in the land management fund's needs for the whole of Australia for a long time into the future&mdash;10, 20 or 30 years. We will never be able to judge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Tracker Tilmouth said to us, and I am sure Tracker said it publicly on many occasions, much of the land we are looking at in the Northern Territory does need quite intensive management. Senator Collins would know a lot more about that than I do because I have made only fleeting visits to the Northern Territory, and that is something that I regret. I would love to spend a lot more time up there because it is a beautiful, fascinating place. The land up there is very fragile and very old and it requires special management needs, particularly if it is going to be used for productive enterprise, but equally so if it is simply to ensure that the environment is protected. As Tracker makes a point of mentioning quite often, a lot of this land is simply not, in his judgment, suitable for pastoral production and should be managed for conservation, tourism and other land use matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality, therefore, is that we will have this distortion created by the government's deception and the minister's deceptions, created by this corrupt&mdash;`corrupt' is probably too strong a word&mdash;stupid, short-sighted decision by ATSIC. It is certainly an unfair decision for the rest of Australian Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. It will ensure that for 10, 20 or 30 years into the future there will have to be a distortion of appropriations from the ILC to ensure that the land that is acquired in the Northern Territory in the coming two-year period, where ATSIC's decision will come into play, is managed properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not something that should be swept under the carpet. The government ministers' involvement in this distortion and this deception of the Senate and, of course, the unanswered questions about the Prime Minister's secret deal with this small team of Aboriginal negotiators is something that will create inequity for Aboriginal people for many generations to come. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my colleagues, Kim Beazley, on one occasion remarked to me that he had been censured in the Senate but that he did not find out about it for three weeks, so censures in the Senate, unfortunately, have not come to be regarded in very good light because so often they have been political censures rather than censures on the facts. But, Senator Harradine, this motion, if it is to be a real motion, and this censure motion, if it is to be treated properly and is not to degrade and devalue the currency of censure motions in the way that has become commonplace in this chamber, has to stand or fall on the terms of the motion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the word you used, Senator Campbell, when you spoke in here. I am talking about this motion, Senator, and it has to stand or fall on its merits. I will go through this motion to point out how false and flawed it is. The words `deception' and `misleading' have been used freely and consistently in this chamber. As I said before, no-one in the parliamentary system has a greater regard for the importance of ministers not misleading a chamber on a matter of fact, and for the convention that the minister's attention should be drawn to a wrong piece of information that he has given and that he should take the first opportunity to correct it, than I have. I have adhered to that throughout my entire parliamentary career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the terms of the motion to see whether these assertions should be fairly considered by this chamber to be matters of fact to justify the grave charges, so devalued in here, of misleading a house or of deception. `Deception' is a very strong word, indeed, Senator Harradine, and one which I would fairly and courteously suggest to you is probably as substantial an impugning of someone's motives as you could get. But I took that in good stride and I did not dispute it. Let us look at (a):</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) on 11th May 1995 Senator Collins said that Senator Campbell was wrong&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Et cetera. It then quotes what I said. The principal issue is that $42 million is available to ATSIC for land acquisition, not $21 million. That is absolutely correct; that is a matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a value judgment, and Senator Campbell is correct in saying this, I have a strong view&mdash;in so far as I am able to provide it because I cannot direct ATSIC as to how it makes decisions&mdash;that ATSIC should devote a substantial proportion of its land acquisition and management funds to management rather than acquisition. In this house I have pointed out before, without fear or favour, that in my view some of the major failures of the past in the Northern Territory, particularly with pastoral properties, have been due to the fact that almost all of the money has been spent on acquisition&mdash;which it is open to ATSIC to do, and that is the point I was making&mdash;rather than management. In recent years, and just in recent years&mdash;this year and last year&mdash;I have been pleased to see, and the record demonstrates this, a greater concentration by ATSIC on management funds than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this chamber before, and Senator Campbell will recall it, that one of the things I lobbied very hard in Cabinet for&mdash;make no bones about this&mdash;was that, when the land fund was created, specific reference to land management, as opposed to land acquisition alone, should be part of ATSIC's charter. As for my deceiving the Senate, it is a fact that it is open to ATSIC to devote every cent of this money to land acquisition, if it chose to do so. There is no hindrance to ATSIC doing that. The record demonstrates that in the past it has devoted the lion's share of this same fund to land acquisition rather than management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision this time to devote $9 million to management sees the largest proportion of money ATSIC has ever devoted to management. In 1990-91 almost all of the fund went to acquisition. In 1991-92, again, almost all of it went to acquisition. In 1992-93, again, the lion's share of it went to acquisition, not management. Those are the figures. It is only this year and last year, I am pleased to say, that ATSIC has determined, as it has the right to do, to devote a greater proportion to management than it has before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is open to ATSIC to spend all of the fund&mdash;its early practice was to spend almost all of it&mdash;on acquisition rather than management. That is the point Senator Chamarette simply does not want to accept. It has been made clear in statements by Lois O'Donoghue that that is the case. I have already tabled her press statement. It is accurate and confirms what I have said about the management break-up of the money and the historical pattern of spending in the Northern Territory. I table it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point of Senator Chamarette's motion falls flat. I make no bones about it: I agree with Senator Campbell that, as a value judgment, it would be very unwise of ATSIC to spend all the fund on land acquisition. I would stand up here and say that, as I have stood up here without fear or favour and expressed my concern about the recent decision ATSIC did take. I did that knowing it would get me some flak from the Northern Territory land councils. But that is a value judgment we are entitled to make in here. It is a value judgment I gave in the Senate during the debate. That is all it was, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record clearly indicates. There was no misleading of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that all of the newspaper reports on this issue have correctly carried the assertion I made that `it was not likely' that ATSIC would do this. I made that assertion on the basis, which Senator Evans also recognised, that there are three people from the Northern Territory on the board of ATSIC. I assumed that they would not have the persuasive powers to persuade a necessary majority of the board to make the decision it ultimately did. I expressed my concern about that at the time and I still do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that my judgment on this issue was not entirely warped is revealed by the extensive controversy the decision has caused within ATSIC. As I have already told the chamber, Lois O'Donoghue is a woman I respect greatly and I did her the courtesy of ringing her before I canvassed that matter in this place. When I found out that the decision had been made on a casting vote of the chair&mdash;the first and, to my knowledge, the only time in ATSIC's history that a casting vote has been used&mdash;I was concerned about it, and I expressed that concern in this chamber. That is a matter of fact. There was no misleading of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is open to ATSIC to spend all of this money on acquisition, should it choose to do so. It is within its charter. I would disagree with it so doing but that is a value judgment I make in here. I cannot direct ATSIC not to do it. So the first assertion made in the censure motion is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to part (b) of the motion. Again, this shows the bizarre interpretation that Senator Chamarette has placed on the words used. On 9 November Senator Evans stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not ATSIC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, he was talking about the land fund. There was a grave concern to ensure that this land fund, which will be funded for land acquisition to a substantially greater level than ATSIC has ever been, should not be able to purchase properties in the Northern Territory and convert them to inalienable freehold title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the undertaking that the Prime Minister has given&mdash;the only undertaking that he has ever given to the Northern Territory government&mdash;and he has discharged it. Senator Chamarette can sit there shaking her head for as long as she likes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was warned. My office received a telephone call from Cathcart and Cathcart told my adviser that he and you&mdash;or the Greens&mdash;would `pursue' me to eternity on this issue. The prospect of being pursued to eternity by Senator Chamarette and Cathcart does not disturb me all that much. But nevertheless, I know the obsession that Senator Chamarette has with her interpretation of these events; it has been relayed directly to my office. All I am saying is that Senator Chamarette has placed a bizarre interpretation on this; an interpretation similar to that which has been placed on it by the New South Wales Land Council. As we speak, the New South Wales Land Council is taking legal action to contest the decision. It is in the federal court now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that Senator Chamarette would have waited until there is a determination&mdash;which I do not think will be long coming&mdash;on that matter. The New South Wales Land Council is entitled to take that legal action. As I have told the Senate, this was a controversial suggestion within ATSIC. It is a matter of public knowledge that it was a split decision and it was determined on the casting vote of the chair of ATSIC. I have expressed my concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not impossible that ATSIC, in its own democratic forum, may perhaps reconsider this decision at some future time. Senator Chamarette is nodding assent to that. The question of the determination of ATSIC and Senator Chamarette's anti-ATSIC agenda&mdash;which is a very public one&mdash;needs to be canvassed. There may be many decisions of ATSIC that I disagree with, and I will say so in here, as I have in the past. But it is a democratically elected body&mdash;unique in that sense&mdash;with elections run by the Australian Electoral Office on exactly the same basis as this parliament is elected. ATSIC is the only other organisation in Australia that has a national election that is similar to ours. It is a democratic vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Aboriginal people disagree with this decision&mdash;and many of them do in the Northern Territory&mdash;they will have an opportunity at the next ATSIC election to cast a vote that reflects that. That is democracy. One cannot stand in here and say, `We should direct them'. That is what Senator Chamarette is saying; it is on the record in the chamber. She says that we should direct ATSIC to change this decision because we disagree with it. That is very democratic! That is great support for Aboriginal self determination! It is the old white support for blacks: `We agree with you as long as you agree with us, and when you do not agree with us, even if we think the decision is dreadfully bad, we will direct you to change it'. They are the words that Senator Chamarette has used. She has called on the government to direct ATSIC&mdash;</PARA>

As I said here in the parliament, the fact that papers were leaked to Senator Campbell is an indication that there were unhappy people inside ATSIC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that in my view&mdash;and the newspapers have correctly reported it&mdash;it was likely that the ATSIC board would not do this.

The New South Wales Land Council did not want the bill, so the Greens opposed it&mdash;to hell with all the other land councils around Australia and to hell with all the other Aboriginal people who actually wanted it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aden Ridgeway did register his objection to the bill and his objection to what was agreed to at that meeting. This agreement was reached in front of a room full of people, not just representatives of Aboriginal organisations but also their advisers and ministerial advisers. There was no secret meeting and no wink, wink, nudge, nudge suggestion from the Prime Minister, which is what you have asserted on the basis of no evidence whatever. What was agreed to was this: a transitional period of two years after 1994-95 during which ATSIC would continue to receive $21 million for land acquisition and management. That is the agreement referred to in the ATSIC papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette, take your warped glasses off, re-read the ATSIC papers and consider what I have just said to you.

The Prime Minister gave no undertaking nor made any decision in respect of how much ATSIC should set aside for land acquisition in the Northern Territory. What is more, it is obvious he had absolutely no capacity to even do so. The suggestion that the Prime Minister could do a deal of the kind alleged by Senator Chamarette is just not credible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The publicly known facts of the board's decision were tied, as I have said before, with the one and only casting vote in ATSIC's history carried on that basis. To even suggest that happened in the face of that publicly known evidence is ludicrous. It was a highly controversial decision and carried only on a casting vote. As I told this chamber, I took the trouble and the courtesy to ring Lois O'Donoghue personally to express my concern about that decision before I did so in this chamber. The ATSIC board made its own decision on how it would allocate the funds. The basis of the board's decision was set out in the chairperson's press statement released on 11 April, which I have tabled for the second time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Chamarette does not want to accept the facts contained in Lois O'Donoghue's press statement. That is fair enough. She can say so. But to censure three ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, on the basis of suggestions of deception, duplicity and misleading when clearly nothing of the sort occurred is just a nonsense. It is a political censure of the Senate, not a real one. This is the most serious part of Senator Chamarette's censure and is the only part which applies to the Prime Minister. Having spoken to the people who were in the room, even though I thought the suggestion was bizarre in the first place, I can assure Senator Chamarette that it is false. It did not happen.

Why don't you ring up Daryl Pearce and the people present at that meeting where all of this was thrashed out? There was no other meeting where a deal was done. It was a negotiation where concessions were made. One of the concessions was that ATSIC would have a transitional role to play for two years in acquiring land.

The historical record of its spending indicates that only in the last two years has it spent any money on management at all. I am pleased that is happening. I would have disagreed with ATSIC if it had made a decision to spend it all to ramp up the acquisitions in the territory. I would have disagreed with ATSIC, but it was open for it to do so because it is a democratically elected board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing today a censure motion against the Prime Minister, Mr Keating; the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans; and the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal affairs, Senator Collins, who is also a Northern Territory Labor Party senator. What Senator Collins has just said&mdash;he made light of this matter&mdash;was a special Joan Sutherland like performance. It sounded musical, it sounded theatrical; but it was very difficult to make sense of the words in plain English.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we address the censure motion before us, it is important to note that each of the three points raised by Senator Chamarette concern land acquisition in the Northern Territory&mdash;and the action of government. Senator Collins made a lot of trying to defend the actions of ATSIC and trying to look at the issues that have been taken on by the management of ATSIC. That is not the issue of this motion; and I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of Senator Chamarette's motion shows very clearly where Senator Collins had been misleading in his statements. Certainly we know that Senator Collins always gets up in the morning and talks to the mirror; goes on doing that all day, and very seldom talks to anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of Senator Chamarette's motion is about where Senator Evans has misled this Senate and been inconsistent. I will quote from what Senator Evans has said in Senate debates, going back several years. I will quote some words he said which also complement and compound those that have been outlined by Senator Chamarette in her censure motion. The third part of the censure motion refers to the Prime Minister's involvement. Essentially, he has been part of it, in approving the budget process of approving funding allocated to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put this matter in context. On 25 October 1993, in the lead-up to the debate on the Native Title Bill, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, wrote to the Prime Minister. I will quote parts of that letter. He issued a very substantive warning that reflects on this motion here today. Mr Perron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Northern Territory, unlike the other States, because of the Land Rights Act, your proposal will result in the purchase and subsequent conversion of productive pastoral land to inalienable freehold. Not only will there then be no obligation to maintain the land as a pastoral venture, but the Act means the veto will apply, there will be no power of acquisition and uncertainty as to whether Territory laws can be fully enforced on that land. Your provision of vastly increased funding and compensation payments for validation will greatly accelerate that process.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the same letter Mr Perron stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land of the territory was granted upon Self Government for the benefit of all Territorians. It has already been significantly reduced and further conversions of pastoral leases will exacerbate the problem. Your proposal overlooks the Territory Government's repeated appeals to you and your predecessors to put a halt to the conversion of the pastoral estate in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulties faced by the Territory were recognised in 1983 by Mr Justice Toohey in his review of the Land Rights Act entitled `Seven Years On'. He noted, after only two pastoral properties had been purchased, that there was no case at that time for precluding future claims to pastoral leases and he went on to state "if, at some future time, more pastoral leases have been acquired by or on behalf of Aboriginals and real problems have arisen in regard to the operation of laws of the Northern Territory and the prohibition against mining, this matter may need to be reconsidered".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier Justice Woodward recognised the potential difficulties which would be caused by claims over pastoral leases. He said "It is my own belief that claims carrying varying degrees of conviction could and would be brought forward in relation to almost all the pastoral properties of the Territory".</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1985 the then Minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Clyde Holding, stated that the "Government would not allow the continuation of the present arrangements whereby pastoral leases could be acquired on the open market and then converted to inalienable freehold title. . . .".</PARA>
<PARA>They were substantive warnings that were given in 1993 by the then Chief Minister to the Prime Minister. I followed that up in the native title debate in November of that year. In the committee stage of that debate, I asked Senator Evans a question, and this impinges on the second part of this censure motion. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that for the last number of years the federal government has been saying that it would amend the Aboriginal Land Rights Act to preclude the conversion of pastoral leases under the Northern Territory act, I am keen to establish how the minister sees these two pieces of legislation working in parallel or working with some degree of compatibility. Given that there are quite extenuating circumstances, will there now be a slush fund that will enable the purchase of more properties?</PARA>
<PARA>I asked this question on 20 December 1993. Very interestingly, Senator Evans replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory government&mdash;Senator Tambling is obviously following that position&mdash;has expressed concerns that the land fund under the legislation we are debating now will be used to convert pastoral leases to inalienable title under the Northern Territory act and hence take advantage of the veto provisions that are associated with that.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated to the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Perron, that we will not necessarily allow the land fund under this act to be used in this way. My understanding is that there has been some communication of that kind and that that has also been repeated to the Aboriginal negotiators on the subject.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Senator Evans in December 1993. I move on almost a year to when we were embroiled in the debate in this chamber on the indigenous land fund. Senator Collins needs to go back and look in his mirror because he obviously does not remember what he said. I remind Senator Collins of what he did say on 16 November last year here in the Senate. He was referring to Senator Chamarette and the very important issues that were under consideration. Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am prepared to bet Senator Chamarette a huge sum of money&mdash;any sum she would like to name&mdash;that the prospect of ATSIC's land acquisition funds exclusively being devoted to land purchases in the Northern Territory is a highly unlikely scenario indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I confidently predict will happen is that the pattern of purchases by ATSIC over the next three years in the Northern Territory will continue very largely as it has since ATSIC was set up, because the same balance of power exists on the commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for Senator Collins's argument. He cannot even go back and remember what he said in November of last year, because further in that same debate he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the transitional arrangements are concerned, I believe they have considerable merit in allowing ATSIC, after a long period of being in the land acquisition business, to gradually wind down its operations over that period while at the same time allowing the ILC to establish its expertise. The government is absolutely assured by ATSIC that there will be no difficulty at all with these transitional arrangements being handled professionally, competently and cooperatively by the Aboriginal organisations concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins today came in here and did a 180-degree turn on those comments he made back in November. Very obviously he gets tripped up by his own rhetoric or by the various arias that he puts out like Joan Sutherland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this month when this issue was being considered here just after the budget and Senator Chamarette had raised it, the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, attacked ATSIC's decision to spend its land fund money for the next two years solely in the territory. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been warning that this would happen for many months but it was denied on all sides from the Prime Minister down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the Territory has to exist under two sets of land rights laws&mdash;unlike the rest of Australia&mdash;Aborigines in the rest of Australia are being denied their fair share of these funds.</PARA>

<PARA>Very important. Bring that back and now put that in the context of yesterday's announcements and statements by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, when he announced the appointment of the new ILC board&mdash;a most interesting issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not into conspiracy theories&mdash;and Senator Collins likes to imply that that is the sort of process&mdash;but we do need to look at the consequences of government decisions because they all flow. As I just illustrated, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Collins rightly are being censured here today by Senator Chamarette's motion because they are just not consistent with what they said previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then it is interesting indeed to look at the appointments of the people to the ILC board yesterday. There is a requirement that the chairperson and four other persons of the ILC board be indigenous people. So who were appointed? Mr David Ross, and his credentials are well set out in the minister's press release as a former director of the Central Land Council and also a current commissioner of ATSIC who is going to step down to take this appointment; Mr Peter Yu, the deputy chairman, who is the Executive Director of the Kimberley Land Council; and Mr Noel Pearson, who is of course the Director of the Cape York Land Council. </PARA>

I think that is a point that Senator Chamarette is making in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other people appointed, Commissioner Stephen Gordon and the Chairman of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, of course, are there because of their position and stature under the act as members of the board of ATSIC. The appointments require at least two members of the board to be people with experience in business or financial management&mdash;at least two. Only two have been appointed. Ms Penny Morris and Mr Lawrie Willett are the two people who have been appointed to do that. So the minister once again has stacked this board, as with so many other appointments, with his particular group of cronies who are not representative of the wide range of Aboriginal interests throughout Australia; he has selectively picked only a few mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important in looking at this entire issue. It is important that we get an Indigenous Land Corporation that is properly representative not only of financial and business interests and those holding statutory office but also of the wide range of Aboriginal expertise that ought to apply throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned&mdash;and I make it quite public&mdash;that I have previously criticised the new Chairman of the ILC, Mr David Ross, because of his prior involvement when, as Director of the Central Land Council, he and the person who now occupies the position of Aboriginal Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Mick Dodson, were the advisory committee to the then Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account in the Northern Territory. I proved, through extensive work in Senate estimates, through the Auditor-General's work and through ATSIC's Office of Evaluation and Audit, that Ross and Dodson were the advisers specifically with regard to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account when it went through major problems of financial mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone would argue with me that millions and millions of dollars of the ABTA were channelled through to the purchase of pastoral properties at the expense of Aboriginal organisational and community grants and inept Aboriginal Land Council administration. For Mr Ross to now be appointed to this position, which will be a billion dollar trust fund, when previously he showed what I term to be gross ineptitude, illustrates that the minister has not properly fulfilled his role and responsibility in that area. I am surprised that Senator Collins and Senator Evans, who were so intimately involved in all the negotiations with these people, were not well aware of the consequences of many of those issues and these appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Senator Collins today and previously in the parliament and also in the media has expressed his reservations about the decisions of ATSIC in this important issue. Senator Collins likes to say, in a grandiose manner, `I disagree, but it is their right.' When it comes to budget provisions, there are still guidelines and principles and there still has to be a consistency in the budget programming of the funding that this parliament makes. Whether it is through the office of the Prime Minister, whether it is through ATSIC, whether it is through the ILC, sure, there can be discretionary decisions within those areas, but the government still has an obligation to the Australian community, and specifically to the Aboriginal interests throughout Australia, to make sure that all these groups are being very well served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins said today that he had reservations about this entire issue. The fact that he talks to the mirrors and does not talk about what I consider to be the issues is a major problem in this area. We need to be reminded that whenever we ask Senator Collins to look at this area he should bring to it an understanding of the Northern Territory, just as I think I do. At the same time, Senator Collins has demonstrated time and time again in this parliament that he is not up to the job of carrying it out consistently. One has only to look at the history of Senator Collins's involvement in his various ministries. He was his own biggest fan in the shipping portfolio. He talked about reforms. He talked about resigning if they were not achieved. Finally, he talked his way out of the whole mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins will be remembered as the minister who was rolled by two Prime Ministers in two portfolios&mdash;firstly by Bob Hawke in shipping on waterfront reform and then by Paul Keating in communications. It has been said in the Senate, I think by Senator Alston, that Senator Collins has been rolled on such a regular basis that he is a laughing stock amongst his colleagues. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> on 5 December 1992 quoted one of Senator Collins's cabinet colleagues as saying, `If I were Bob Collins I would probably have slashed my wrists by now.' We need to remember that the Civil Aviation Authority hit the headlines in 1992 when it stood aside two executives following a damning report into the tendering process of a $300 million air traffic control system; yet we are supposed to believe that Senator Collins had no idea what was happening in the portfolio, even though he was the aviation minister at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can he come in here today and argue this land acquisition issue with regard to the ATSIC funding program? He argued that back in December last year with a very different turn of phrase to what he applies it today. Perhaps instead of looking at mirrors we should ask Senator Collins to go back and remind himself of the entire fiasco that he created in pay TV and how that went. He should look at the decision-making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore not surprising that Senator Chamarette has been so frustrated, so annoyed and so indignant&mdash;and I share that annoyance and indignation&mdash;at the way in which Senator Collins has attempted to shift on this issue and to use the debate purely to be like Joan Sutherland and be very theatrical. It does not work. The issue we need to be guaranteed of with the funding for ATSIC&mdash;and it is over $1 billion&mdash;and the funding that is being created into the Indigenous Land Corporation, which is also so important for the long-term interests of Aboriginal people and their social development in Australia, cannot be treated with inconsistency or in this attempt to mislead and to totally confuse Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal affairs is a significant issue. It is a significant and important budget allocation of this parliament. The parliament has now underpinned it with important legislation. Honourable senators will remember that the creation of ATSIC was a complex, difficult and onerous task of this parliament. The fact that there were so many amendments to the legislation in its gestation to create it pointed out not only the controversy within the wider community but also that the debate centred on a lot of the issues required by Aboriginal interests and Aboriginal people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The native title debates of 1993 were probably, in my memory, the most important, most paramount and most difficult in the Senate, certainly in my time here. To now find that Senator Gareth Evans is not honouring the statements and the commitments he gave at that time in this debate or in this year's budget is much more than annoying and gives us much more reason to be indignant. For Senator Collins to come in here and to play as if this were a petty cash voucher system does not carry any weight. The facts need to be clearly stated. Certainly there is an accountability requirement on the board of ATSIC to fully explain and detail the decisions that that commission has taken. But I do not expect government ministers to then come in here and fudge the truth about such issues. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of process, considering that Senator Chamarette already has a return to order due for debate later today, I was waiting to see the documents that were going to be produced by the government. My expectation was that we proceed in these matters usually in a fairly logical order. We ask for the extra information; we assess the information; then we decide whether there is information worthy of censure of a particular minister or ministers. I am not sure, having listened to the debate so far, that the `facts' have been proven or disproven, and I will move to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot resist, though, making a comment on the matter of self-determination, because I sat here for all those hours too, particularly on the matter of whether individual indigenous people should be allowed to purchase land. I heard members of the opposition and the Greens say repeatedly, on the matter of self-determination, that Aboriginal people should be allowed to make mistakes as well: if they wanted to get this land and then on-sell it straightaway, that was their choice. We had quite a discussion about whether self-determination meant the right to make mistakes or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without saying anything about ATSIC's decision, the same principle applies to ATSIC's decision. It is the principle of self-determination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to ask questions about the facts of parts (a), (b) and (c) of the motion. In relation to part (a), Senator Tambling talked at length about what Senator Collins said on 16 November but the fact is that this censure motion confines its remarks to what Senator Collins said on 11 May. That background may have been useful for him but that is just a technical explanation. Senator Collins is quoted as making the distinction on 11 May between $42 million and $21 million being available to ATSIC. I made a point of speaking to the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My researcher spoke at length with Mr Darryl Pearce when this matter was first raised on 11 May. I think we can put a different interpretation on this $21 million and $42 million&mdash;that interpretation being that ATSIC made a decision to quarantine two lots of $10 million over the next two years. As well as that, there was $9 million per annum to land maintenance Australia-wide and $2 million per annum for the rest of Australia for purchase. I do not think it is fair to say that Senator Collins is being misleading over the distinction between the $21 million or the $42 million because, quite clearly, you can get $42 million over two years from the breakdown of ATSIC's figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to part (b) of the censure motion, I think we can say, as the conclusion of the quotation says, that ATSIC's decision will cause a dramatic increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act. That is quite clearly the case. As to the assertion that Senator Gareth Evans has misled the parliament in that respect, that is wrong because, as has been pointed out, this is the allocation of new moneys to the land fund that Senator Evans has been quoted as referring to, not ATSIC. The land corporation has not yet made any determination of what moneys should be spent in the Northern Territory or anywhere else. Senator Tambling has advised us that it has just been appointed. I think it is wrong to say that in referring to the allocation of new moneys to the land fund and the fact that it would not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act, Senator Evans was misleading the Parliament, because technically the terms of part (b) do not show that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (c) of this motion says that an ATSIC board briefing paper reveals that an agreement had been struck between the Prime Minister, ATSIC and a group of `indigenous Land Fund Bill negotiators', et cetera. The briefing paper says that there will be special treatment for the Northern Territory for land acquisitions from ATSIC's land acquisition maintenance program in line with discussions with government and the restrictions of the bill. I do not see any conspiracy there that we should be alarmed about. Others have pointed out the facts already. Why should we disbelieve these people? Is there some evidence that we should disbelieve Mr Darryl Pearce when he says that the Northern Land Council has done no deal and there is no conspiracy of an arrangement with the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is on the record is what we heard in the debate&mdash;that the Prime Minister extracted agreement from the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for support for the bill in return for a sunset clause for indigenous land claims in the Northern Territory by 1997. The dialogue between the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory came up in the wider debate, but that is not a deal. I do not understand why we would be reading something conspiratorial into this ATSIC board briefing paper. There are parallel arrangements, there are restrictions and there is an overlap of what happens in the Northern Territory Land Rights Act and the application of the land acquisition fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not secret; this is on the record. We have talked about it before. Yes, there is a transitional arrangement for two years, and what was agreed was part of the debate that we had. It is also on the public record. I guess what it is about is ATSIC's right to link politically some opportunities in the way other people link them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ATSIC is given compelling argument by indigenous people in the Northern Territory through the normal ATSIC processes that the Northern Territory has a particular case, that it should be given special consideration, and if ATSIC is persuaded of that, then it is its right to be persuaded of that. If ATSIC sees it as a priority, it is ATSIC's right to do so. If, as part of the discussions, those claimants or those arguing the case also say, `And we understand we don't have any priority in the allocation of money under the indigenous land fund', then what is wrong with ATSIC linking those two decisions, claims or whatever you want to call them? We might not like the outcome, but there is nothing intrinsically wrong with its right to do that. That is the politics of it, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the fact, on the matter of self-determination, that ATSIC has the right to do everything it has done. On the matter of the censure motion, I do not believe that the case has been proven in relation to part (a).<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to part (b), I do not believe that the appropriate distinction between the ATSIC decision and its ramifications and Senator Gareth Evans's assertions about what would happen to moneys in the land fund has been adequately proven. Yes, there is more land claimed under the land rights act, but not because of the allocation of new moneys to the land fund, so I do not believe that has been misleading at all. Regarding part (c), I do not believe that a substantial case has been made out to warrant censure. Decisions have been made; they may be political decisions. It was perfectly entitled to make those decisions, and that is the fact of the matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that on our side and, I am certain, on Senator Chamarette's side as well, there is no particular criticism of ATSIC. It is simply that in this matter, when this legislation was coming through, we warned the government what it would lead to. We were told in no uncertain terms that we were wrong. The words used by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins over the course of the debate, which Senator Chamarette and Senator Campbell have referred to, led the parliament and the Australian public to believe in certain things. Perhaps, when you examine them, the words used could support some of the things that Senator Evans said but the whole tenor of the debate was meant to give a certain impression and was meant to convince some of those in the Senate which way they should vote. That is our concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike Senator Kernot, I found the case put by Senator Chamarette in moving this censure quite compelling.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Senator Collins was not supported in the quorum, I suspect, shows that the Labor party is waking up to him. As I recall my history, Senator Collins was not going to be put in the ministry a few years back. He had not shown any particular ability or competence, but the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, for some reason insisted that Senator Collins be brought onto the front bench. I am not quite sure of the reason, but Mr Hawke stood on caucus&mdash;perhaps someone in caucus will tell me that this is not right&mdash;and made sure that Senator Collins was appointed a minister. Senator Collins owes his political position to the goodwill and the work of Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that goodwill was not reciprocated during the very vicious leadership battle and Senator Collins apparently had no hesitation in switching camps and going to Mr Keating&mdash;no doubt retaining his spot on the front bench. Unfortunately for Senator Collins, he has the problem now that no matter what he says in his defence nobody believes him because his credibility is completely shot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Tambling has quite rightly pointed out&mdash;and I will waste the time of the Senate in repeating it&mdash;that Senator Collins has a history of having things go wrong in his department. The pay TV fiasco became a laughing-stock. We all remember those days. It was serious, but one could not help having another chuckle every day about the way the pay TV issue was handled. The TAAATS communication matter was another fiasco. All the problems that we have had with the CAA were initiated whilst Senator Collins was the minister. As my colleagues have quite rightly pointed out, we also have the matter of waterfront reform. This is typical of Senator Collins' performance here today. He said, `I will resign on 6 May' or whatever the date was `if the waterfront is not fixed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I entered the parliament I saw Senator Collins at a chamber of commerce meeting in Townsville. I thought, `Oh, this guy is good. Fancy putting your career on the line'. Senator Collins said, `I am going to fix the waterfront or I will resign.' Senator Collins received a standing ovation from the audience&mdash;including me. I have to confess how stupid I was at the time. That is the way that this guy does it. He said he would resign, but what happened? The waterfront is in an absolute mess. As Senator Campbell pointed out, one has only to go to Western Australia to see the great reform that Senator Collins brought to the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he gets away with it because of the way he does it. People are waking up to him now. He said, `I will resign if it is not fixed.' There were great cheers, but nothing happened. Of course, he does not resign. In this instance Senator Collins said, `I will bet you any money you like that this is not going to happen.' As Senator Chamarette said, if she had taken his bet she would have been a wealthy woman now. </PARA>

He says, `I will bet you this' and `I will resign if this does not happen.' The farmers say, `Oh well, he sounds pretty good,' but he never delivers on anything. This particular debate before us today is exactly the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to pretend to the Senate&mdash;I do not think that the Senate would believe it anyway. I am not involved in the substantive issue before us. I am entering into this debate because I consider the allegation of misleading the Senate, particularly a minister of the crown misleading the Senate, the most serious. Without any particular involvement in the substantive issue that has been discussed, I have listened to what has been said, and I think it is quite clear that Senator Collins has misled the Senate in a number of ways. These have been pointed out by the previous speakers. I do not want to go through them, but I will make a couple of comments about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before us calling upon the parliament to censure the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy relates some issues. I refer to paragraph (c). The ATSIC briefing paper which has been spoken about quite clearly reveals that an agreement had been struck between the Prime Minister and ATSIC and a group of indigenous land fund negotiators about singling out the Northern Territory. From the debate so far, I think that has become very clear, and some answers need to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have borrowed from Senator Chamarette's speech some of the questions which she asked and to which, I regret to say, both Senator Evans and Senator Collins, who were talking to advisers, did not even listen. Therefore, they did not answer them. I think it is worth repeating the questions: was there an agreement struck between the government, ATSIC and a group of indigenous land fund bill negotiators? Senator Collins has, I think, in a roundabout way, denied it. But he has not at all been convincing. He has not answered the particular allegations that Senator Chamarette and, I think, Senator Campbell put to him. He certainly did not answer the questions, and neither did Senator Evans, about what the Prime Minister actually dealt with in this deal, what the terms of those agreements were, whether they included agreements about appointments to the ILC board and whether special attention would be given to Northern Territory Aboriginal people above Aboriginal people in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question went on to ask: if all of that was wrong, what is then meant by the ATSIC briefing paper? There was no satisfactory answer from either Senator Collins or Senator Evans to those questions. I doubt that they heard them, because, in their typical way of paying little respect to the Senate, they were not listening. It raises questions which, again, need to be answered: did the Leader of the Government in the Senate lie? Did Senator Bob Collins lie? What was Mr Keating's part in all this? These are questions which have been asked, but still have not been answered and must be satisfactorily answered if these ministers are to have any credibility at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to paragraph (a) of the censure motion. As I understand it, Senator Chamarette is saying there that Senator Campbell said that $20 million out of $24 million had been allocated for land acquisition in the Northern Territory. Senator Collins got up and said that that was not right; it is not $20 million out of $24 million, it is $20 million out of $42 million. So, if they spend $20 million in the Northern Territory, they still have $22 million to spend on the rest of Australia. That is the impression he was trying to get across. He was trying to say that it is not an inordinate amount for the Northern Territory, because there is another $22 million that you can spend elsewhere. That is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A considerable part of that $42 million had, as I understand it, been committed to management. ATSIC might say, `We'll buy $42 million worth of cars, but we won't allocate any money to put petrol in them?' Why would you do that? You would not buy the cars without having some way of managing them and of making them go. Similarly, with land purchases, you do not buy $42 million worth of land and put no money aside to manage that land. That is patently ridiculous. Senator Collins was trying to say, `$20 million is not a big amount because the rest of Australia will get another $22 million.' That was not right. He knew it was not right. For trying to move the debate from reality and trying to hide and confuse the facts, Senator Collins deserves to be censured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One thing that Senator Kernot rightly pointed out in this debate was that we were not talking about what was allocated to ATSIC. She said that Senator Collins's bet of large sums of money is not part of the censure motion. It is worth making reference to it to demonstrate that, in this whole course of events, Senator Collins and Senator Evans, to a lesser degree, have tried to confuse the issue and put it off track. As Senator Collins stated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only fear that would then be raised, and I am prepared to bet large sums of money that this is not going to happen, is that the $21 million of ATSIC funds would be used . . . exclusively or largely over the next three years to purchase land in the Northern Territory to the exclusion of elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins was trying to say that he would bet millions that this $21 million would not be spent on land acquisitions in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then became quite obvious, through the minute of the meeting that Senator Campbell tabled in the parliament and which was the subject of his question without notice on 11 May that $10 million was set aside one year for land purchases in the Northern Territory, $2 million elsewhere and $10 million in the following year. There was the $20 million for land acquisitions in the Northern Territory which Senator Collins previously had `bet you any money you like' would not be spent on land acquisitions. Whilst it is not part of the motion, it is relevant to show the way that these particular ministers have tried to confuse the issue and mislead the Senate about a very important matter which deserves better attention from the nation's parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that other honourable senators want to speak to this debate and we have other business to deal with, so I will leave my remarks there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to add a bit to this debate. I will not get into the substantive measures involved but I want to put a few points on the record. Before I do that, I congratulate Senator Chamarette of the Greens for having the gall to tackle the government and for having the gumption to tackle the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this matter, and to tackle Senator Collins on what has gone on here today. Rather than debating this motion, I am sure the government and those of us on this side would have much preferred to get on with the business of the day, knowing how short a time we have to complete before 1 July the start-up legislation under the budget program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Collins had any gumption, he would have come clean, in answer to the request made by Senator Chamarette, with all the papers and documents requested. No, he chose not to&mdash;I think he will be forced to&mdash;so we have now lost at least an hour and a half today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put it on the record that the Western Australian Greens have finally come to the realisation that not all is well in ATSIC. Senator Chamarette may remember a proposed inquiry into the accountability of ATSIC and its forward programs, an inquiry that I wanted some 12 months ago. On that occasion I was very nasty with her for not supporting my proposal, but I suppose the Greens were new to the chamber&mdash;so we can forgive them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too late to have that inquiry now because we are close to an election and the coalition, in government, will put things in order. If we had had 12 months ago that inquiry on the accountability of ATSIC, we would have been in a far better position. Most importantly, ATSIC and the Aboriginal community would have been in a far better position than they are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn now to the Australian Democrats. Senator Kernot bounded into this place and told the Senate that she had not heard of this motion until five minutes ago. She immediately, of course, took on the defence of the government, as the Democrats do. Let me put it on the record again in this place&mdash;this is also for the benefit of the rest of Australia as it is a non-broadcast day&mdash;that Senator Kernot had given me an undertaking over 12 months ago that she would support my proposed inquiry into ATSIC. We debated the motion but, unfortunately, on the Thursday night we ran out of time. When the debate came on, on the following Tuesday, she had turned tail and would not support us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the reason for turning tail over the weekend? I probably still have the relevant letter on record in my files. I had kept it in my drawer in the Senate but, unfortunately, I lost it in the last few days when changing desks. The letter was from Lois O'Donoghue and it implored Senator Kernot to retract the support of the Australian Democrats for my motion to have an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot is the leader of a party in this parliament which pretends to have the balance of power. Fortunately the Democrats do not have the balance of power now, but they still think they do. On the strength of one letter from the head of ATSIC&mdash;I thought it was unethical and I said so at the time&mdash;Senator Kernot turned around and refused to support my motion. At least the Greens of Western Australia said first up that they would have supported my inquiry. I believe that they have learnt the error of their ways. If I was to propose that inquiry now, except that it is too close to the election, I am sure that Senator Chamarette would be the first to support such an inquiry. However, as I said before, our side will be in government very soon and we will fix those problems with ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Senator Kernot stands condemned for once again blindly supporting the government. We all know&mdash;those of us on this side anyway&mdash;that Senator Collins failed to come up with the documents that are so urgently needed. Of course, he was covering up for the blunder he made. I am not going to criticise him for the waterfront and the other mistakes he has made in the past. They are well recorded and I will not repeat them now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I congratulate Senator Chamarette for her motion. I condemn Senator Kernot for once again defending the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the censure motion moved against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) for misleading the Senate and the people of Australia over the use of land fund money available through ATSIC. I would particularly like to make reference to my own state of Victoria which, after all the statements made by those personages over the last two years, would have every right to feel that it has been misled in every way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Act and the land fund acquisition bill made it very clear, or were supposed to make it very clear, to Aboriginals throughout Australia that they would ultimately have access to land fund money or to money available through ATSIC. As I think has been proved by my colleagues in respect of the differing statements made by Senator Evans and Senator Collins, this will indeed prove not to be the case, with much of the money going to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say that, obviously the right of ATSIC to make that decision must be respected. But the process by which it was arrived at and the devious manner in which these particular parliamentary ministers proceeded to arrive at that arrangement are things on which I feel Aboriginals in Victoria have every right to feel that they have been mislead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will recall that over January the select committee on the land fund bill had a series of hearings throughout Australia in most capital cities on whether or not Aboriginals had been consulted on their input into the way in which the land fund was to be used. I make particular reference to the hearings that the committee held in Melbourne on Tuesday, 17 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaker after speaker, in their submissions at that hearing, referred to the fact that in any consideration of disbursement of land fund money through ATSIC or through the ILC, consideration must be given to Aboriginals throughout Australia as well as Aboriginals in the northern rural and remote areas of Australia. No disclaimer was ever put by the government, the Prime Minister, or the ministers involved on the fact that that was what would happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally enough, Aboriginals in the southern states have been led to believe that they will have equal access to land fund money. I would like to quote from some of their remarks on that day on the reasons why this would occur. For instance, Ms Sharon Firebrace, Director of Palm River Pty Ltd, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a dispossessed point of view, the people in Victoria and the south-east west coast of Australia are the most dispossessed. I think we should have priority over those in communities who are not so severely dispossessed and who have access to native title. I speak predominantly of the northern communities.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Johal, solicitor for the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is of particular relevance to Victoria&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">talking about the disbursement of money through the land fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because in Victoria you are now unable to claim compensation for any act done prior to 1975 and most of Victoria, perhaps all, was taken away from the rightful owners prior to that date. So Victoria is actually in double jeopardy in terms of native title as well as the land fund and it has got to be addressed, particularly from that perspective.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Larry Kanoa, Director of the Ballarat and District Aboriginal Cooperative, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, our community&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>speaking of the Victorian Aboriginal community&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">still has needs similar to other Aboriginal peoples and communities across Australia in relation to owning and managing their own lands. Communities such as Ballarat are surely the most dispossessed in Australia and have been for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Edward Lovett, a founding member of the Ballarat and District Aboriginal Cooperative, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Victoria we seem to miss out on a lot of things that happen, especially funding wise. We seem to get more or less the crumbs on the plate.</PARA>
<PARA>That particular phrase sums up very well the division of money that has just been made according to the ATSIC board briefing paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot spoke before about us dividing the Aboriginal community. It is this sort of decision that will divide the Aboriginal community in north set against south and urban against rural. Many more divisions will appear in the Aboriginal community as a result of funding decisions like these and the singling out of the Northern Territory which is particularly mentioned in paragraph (c) of the censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again quote from the land fund hearing on Tuesday, 17 January. Mr Edward Lovett must have had a degree of foresight when he made this remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the national strategy will only reflect the requirements of the few regions with the biggest numbers and/or largest political influence.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that is exemplified by the way in which the ILC board is being made up. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been evident by the lesser recognition by ATSIC of Koories in the South Eastern States.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that proved to be a very forward looking remark. Mr Andrew McEwen, senior project officer of ATSIC Victoria, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is that we believe, and our submission argues, that the bill has been framed to meet the needs of northern and remote communities and not in fact to meet the legitimate economic needs and aspirations of urban communities. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that is larger, obviously, in remote communities, if we are going to have an economic future for the Koori families in Victoria, we require the legislation to very clearly enable . . . families, clans and organisations in Victoria to get into the economic development main game, not just to purchase land.</PARA>
<PARA>How is this funding decision going to assist that? It is not. He made this further remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the real issue is about equity and fairness between the states and territories and the various families and tribes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the land fund bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is based on meeting the needs of more remote communities and not on dealing with the problems and the economic realities of urban indigenous people in Australia, which constitute 67 per cent of the indigenous people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>To divert this money in the manner that has been done, towards singling out the Northern Territory, would clearly seem to divide the Aboriginal community further and not unite it. Mr McEwen continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That then means, in terms of southern and urban indigenous Australians, that 30 per cent more resources go out of ATSIC to the northern communities to fix up the infrastructure deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So when you look at the total economic model for Koori families, on one level of public perception, you say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to the framers of the bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need is up in the north, or in remote communities. On another level, what you have actually got is an adjusted income for the Koori families in Victoria of $5,400, which would compare with $9,000 for indigenous people in the Northern Territory, if you add in the value of the mineral royalties and land claims. So that is a major problem. The majority of poverty in indigenous Australia is in urban areas. That is not to disrespect or devalue particularly the dispossessed people across Australia and the infrastructure problems in communities. But the Senate committee must be well aware that the majority of dispossessed and Kooris living in poverty are in urban areas, not in remote and rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA>Never at any stage in the two years of debate on either native title or the land fund bill was any mention made by the government of the proportions, or the geographical areas to which money would be distributed. Some of us imagined that a more or less even division would be made across Australia, probably on a needs basis. The way in which this division has been done is singling out a particular area for very privileged treatment, for special treatment, as is stated in the censure motion. Mr Andrew McEwen's final remark was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC and, by other levels of government, the Victorian Koori community, is underfunded by $5 million. If you do not have an asset base it is extremely difficult to borrow and to set up an economic development base.</PARA>
<PARA>Among its more generous assessments of the government's land fund bill it has always been imagined that not only was money available to buy land but also, in the longer term, it would be made available for Aboriginals to build up an economic development base. If some areas of Australia are being treated more generously than others in the way that Senator Collins and Senator Evans now appear to be doing, this simply will not happen. One of the government's landmark words has always been `equity'. I ask honourable senators: where is the equity in this if an agreement has indeed been struck between the Prime Minister, ATSIC and a group of indigenous land fund bill negotiators in singling out the Northern Territory? There is no equity in that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have found that a matter of public interest drawn to my attention by a taxi company in Launceston, Tasmania, is a matter of much more widespread interest than purely for one company in Launceston. In fact, thousands of taxis throughout Australia have been affected by the incompetence or delaying tactics of Telecom.  I, in trying to represent the interests of the taxis, have been thwarted by either the incompetence or the stonewalling of the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is the 131-008 problem for taxis. Back in about 1992 the taxi companies of Australia were informed that they could have a better system of access for mobile telephone users and for everybody else by using a 131-008 national taxi phone network. However, mobile users using that 131 number get put through to a Melbourne company even if they are in Tasmania or in Timbuktu. If a non-mobile phone is used, the call goes through to the local company as the caller planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxi companies which found that mobile phone customers were getting the raw end of the deal started to complain. They were told by Telecom, `This is going to be fixed soon.' Although they started complaining in about 1992, they were told that the technical difficulty was to be resolved by August 1994. That was later amended to August 1995. There is still no certain date as to when it is going to be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had representations from my local taxi company, Central Cabs. In September last year I made representations to Telecom chief executive officer Mr Ted Taylor and to the industry ombudsman, Mr Warwick Smith. The ombudsman said that, following Telecom's response, the taxi companies were to get back to him if there were further problems. Telecom responded on 17 October, saying that the problem was recognised but no commitment for a solution could be given at that stage and that the 131-008 service franchise owner, which is in Sydney, had been contacted with suggestions for improving the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 October I wrote to Minister Lee asking why no commitment had been given for a solution, what was being done to solve the problem and, if nothing was being done, why not. On 12 December I sent a reminder letter to the minister. On 31 March my office phoned the minister's office. We had had no communication from the minister's office at all. My staff were told that the delay was due to Telecom's failure to get back to the minister&mdash;a communication problem between the minister and Telecom. We were told to expect a response within two weeks. That was 31 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 May my office rang again. We still had received nothing from the minister. We were told that the continued delay was because the response provided by the department was not satisfactory and it had been returned from the minister's office to the department several times&mdash;not once&mdash;for changes. On 3 May it was awaiting the minister's signature. There must be carrier pigeons carrying correspondence from Minister Lee to my office! It has been pretty standard in the past on other matters for me to wait five or six months to get a response from the minister. As of 31 May&mdash;that is today&mdash;I have still not received a response from Minister Lee, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, on a matter which is affecting thousands of taxis around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just draw to senators' attention some extracts from a letter that was written to Telecom on 17 September last year by the Executive Officer of Taxi 131-008 Pty Ltd&mdash;that is the company that arranges these access telephone numbers for taxi companies around Australia. He wrote to Mr Frank Blount on 17 September and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of the fact that Telecom will only presently provide four (4) receiving locations for incoming mobile phone calls to 131 008 within Australia, the cost of routing the taxi booking to the local taxi operator (the Telecom relaying charges and the labour costs associated with double handling) are commercially unacceptable. As an example I draw your attention to the taxi customer with a mobile phone in Perth. His/her call is routed to our 131 008 answering location in Adelaide, Suburban Taxis. Suburban takes the booking then faxes it back immediately to our Perth Licensee B &amp; W Cabs. At times of peak demand it is anticipated this will require a continuously open fax line between the two companies if we are to service the requirements of a reasonable proportion of our Perth customers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are now over forty taxi companies throughout Australia accessing the 131 008 network.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that a growing number of their customers who have and use mobile phones are being routed not to the taxi company that they think they are ringing, but through one of the four receiving stations that are provided for this service by Telecom. It is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very real suspicion that it is suiting Telecom very nicely, thank you, because these are analog calls. Once Telecom puts up digital equipment to improve the service for these taxi numbers, its competitors, Vodaphone and Optus, will be able to compete with it in this lucrative market. For the moment, Telecom has a monopoly on the thousands and thousands of calls that are going out every day for the booking of taxis. Telecom has it in its own interest to drag its feet and not provide better relay stations so that it can keep its competitors out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the minister for communications in this country would have seen through Telecom, would have been concerned about the telephone users in this country and would have been worried for the small businesses that Mr Keating is desperately trying to run out of business. I would have thought the minister for communications would have recognised that communications for small business is a critically important part of business and would be trying to do something to stop this monopoly treating small business and individuals in the cavalier fashion that it has over these calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxi companies tell me that daily they receive calls from many dissatisfied customers and that the usage of the 131-008 number has proved terribly complex and a serious problem with public relations with their customers. Why is it that this issue has gone right back to 1992 when Taxi 131-008 Pty Ltd first raised the issue with Telecom? Why is it that the minister has had such trouble providing a response? Why is it that he will not come out publicly and explain some of the things that I have been putting on the record here today? Why is it that the minister's office is clearly so totally incompetent that, despite phone calls and repeated letters, a senator in this parliament cannot get an answer from the minister responsible for communications?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a totally unacceptable matter. I think it is a disgrace; it is scandalous, in fact. Is it a fact that the minister is encouraging Telecom to pursue this monopoly for all it is worth? Does the minister want to cut Optus and Vodaphone out of the market? Is that really what he is about?  Let him come out and deny it. His delay has meant that this monopoly has continued for even longer than it did previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thousands of taxis around Australia are fed up with the way Telecom has been treating them. They are fed up as customers of Telecom that they cannot get a decent service. They are fed up with this government and this minister's lack of concern for them and their customers. I would not want to have the taxis of Australia badmouthing me in the months leading up to the election. It is one more example of the arrogance and complacency of this government and its lack of attention to the needs of average battlers trying to make a quid in today's Australia that there has not been something done about this before now. It is a total and utter national disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue some remarks which I made when asking a question and taking note of an answer of the Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), about a week ago relating to the Industry Commission inquiry into charities. I draw the attention of the Senate to the draft report of that inquiry and draft recommendation No. 4, which indicates a concern which I have been expressing&mdash;many of the charities have also expressed this&mdash;on many occasions. The recommendation reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth and state/territory governments should develop a set of principles for the selection of service providers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">applications should be called by open tender . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This practice&mdash;which is a draft recommendation of the Industry Commission&mdash;was confirmed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, as the government's preference at a breakfast last Monday morning organised by the National Anglican Caring Organisations Network. I want to place on record again both my opposition, and certainly the opposition of most welfare organisations in Australia, to the possibility of this practice&mdash;and for very good reasons. For the information of the Senate, I will read a little more of the draft report of the Industry Commission. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more mature financial relationship between the sector and government would also give greater assurance to governments that policy objectives will be effectively and efficiently fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to ask the question: whose policy objectives and who is getting the assurance? Certainly governments need assurance that money they spend is efficiently and effectively used. I would like to suggest that what is far more important are the policy objectives of those charity and welfare organisations which government is seeking to control in this way. The report of the commission goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But governments also need to ensure that funding arrangements encourage best practice, and that poorer performing CSWOs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>community service welfare organisations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which cannot lift their performance or form co-operative alliances to offset their disadvantages, vacate the field in favour of more effective CSWOs. Their funding should not be continued at the expense of those CSWOs which can provide a better quality service or the same quality of service at lower cost.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds very well but there are a number of questions which are absolutely critical and which are causing great concern to the whole of the welfare, community and church sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these concerns is a fundamental one. Who defines poor performance? Who defines quality service? What about a service provided, for instance, by the Catholic church at Port Hedland to boat people? This service has been the basis for severe criticisms of the government by the Catholic church, or at least by those involved in providing that service. Would senators say to me that government would fund that kind of service which was so critical of government policy, or would it be defined as being a poor performer and as not being a quality service?  Senators can see the problem. In its report, the Industry Commission further comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tendering would improve efficiency by encouraging best practice through opening up service delivery to alternative suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this mean private agencies? Are we going to allow private agencies to make a profit from welfare delivery? What about the welfare infrastructure&mdash;a vast infrastructure which has been established by the churches and other welfare agencies across Australia? Are we going to say to them, `If you don't obtain funding by tender, bad luck. Someone else is going to take over and all that infrastructure which you've developed will simply go down the drain'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Senate need not take my word for these concerns. Let me place on record, in the time I have available, some of the concerns which have been put in writing to me and to the Australian Democrats. Eldercare is the agency in South Australia that the Uniting Church uses to deliver its service to the aged. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eldercare Inc. is not a prominent organisation but we are one of the larger providers of care to the elderly in South Australia. The Industry Commission lists us in the 50 largest charitable organisations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eldercare has over the last 3-4 years undergone considerable self-initiated change and actively pursues good management and competitive outcomes. We do this for the two reasons of providing better care to our residents and to achieve some surplus which we can direct specifically to areas of need that are not covered by other funding opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My reading of the emerging assessments is that the loss of the current tax exempt status will do several things . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I should explain again to the Senate that the trade-off is the loss of the tax exempt status for funding by tender. This is what Eldercare says are its concerns if this trade-off should go ahead. They read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.charitable organisations in aged care, with their low overheads and providing maximum value to residents, in order to manage the new taxation arrangements will have to introduce administrative structures and new costs which produce no gains to government, the beneficiaries of the service, nor the organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.access to tax concessions has allowed the not-for-profit sector to competitively recruit quality managers at no additional cost, but with significant qualitative and tangible benefits to the beneficiaries, governments and the organisations from improved efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the recommendation by the Commission that these changes be introduced on a revenue neutral basis to government is clearly flawed in that all taxes cost to collect and dispense. With three or four tax collection and dispensing steps being proposed the current funds available may shrink by up to 40-45%. Revenue neutral does not necessarily equate with cost neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA>In his conclusion, the writer of this, the chief executive officer of Eldercare, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After much deliberation I am still not able to see the gains to government or the community from the changes being suggested to the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Aged Care the Commonwealth government's own consultancies are clearly showing considerable funding difficulties and shortfalls. We as an industry are just coping now. If the government was to adopt the report as it is currently drafted it would create a funding crisis with no winners.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Anglican Caring Organisations Network has a critique of the Industry Commission's report. In that critique it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One question not asked is why the community organisations continue to exist&mdash;what is the reason and motivation which sustains a `non-profit' organisation? The answers to this are fundamental to understanding the sector, viz.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the importance of the values of community organisations which motivate them to continue to exist (irrespective of government funding) and which attract continuing community support in cash and time . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the importance of the `charitable impulse' . . . or in other words, the relationship where assistance is given to the organisation from the concerned community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a `market response'&mdash;a market would leave the less deserving to their own fate, if they could not afford to buy their `wants' (needs). The charitable impulse does not operate on market principles&mdash;it operates on the principle of responsibility for one's neighbour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a deficiency in the report. In not acknowledging the power of the organisations' values in directing its activity, nor the power of the cooperative effort where people respond to a need without market incentive, the report is somewhat out of focus.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the government will take note of these concerns. The Anglican organisation further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent history of tendering has shown that `savings' have been achieved by reduction in client service ie. less time for client support, and focus solely on the specific service eg. deliver a meal. The Christian ethic places a responsibility on agencies to provide for the whole person, not to neglect their human needs which surround the direct service.</PARA>
<PARA>The national organisation of the Uniting Church has also spoken of its concern in a press release headed `Government at risk of eroding the work of charities'. It states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Services Australia, the national body for Community Services in the Uniting Church, is concerned the Commission and the Government has not given enough consideration to the way market forces are complicated by human factors associated with community service development and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>Robert Fitzgerald of the Australian Council of Social Service, writing about the report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impact</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also assumes that applying certain market mechanisms, particularly tendering, will produce better outcomes for clients and enhanced performance. This is a very questionable assumption that warrants rigorous scrutiny before being accepted as a general principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must never be forgotten that community services are not `just another business'. Nor are we simply agents of government or `little fingers of the state'. Moves towards increased competition and more prescriptive output based funding run the risk of undermining the very strengths of the sector which the Commission has highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA>In a press report from Australian Associated Press, the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Melbourne has placed on record its concerns. In the same press release Mr Begley, the Salvation Army representative at the commission hearings, has also placed his concerns on the record. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Begley said removal of tax concessions would add considerably to the cost of service delivery and could result in some reduction in programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`The Commission suggests that any change in tax exemptions should be `revenue neutral', however, experience has shown that government budget constraints frequently lead to a drop in funding resulting in deficits for approved programs.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Council of the Society of St Vincent De Paul, in a very serious comment, totally rejected the idea of the tendering model. The society rejects this recommendation as the tendering model is based on a profit oriented paradigm. This process will inevitably lead to one community service organisation being played off against another community service organisation and with the client being the loser. As previously stated to the Industry Commission, it is unlikely that the society will tender for projects in competition with other organisations. In collaborative community models, both the selection of the types of expanded services needed and the selection of the deliverers are carried out through a joint community planning and decision making process. That process will be lost in the model which is proposed. The society concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the Society strongly objects to tendering for family/community based service delivery based exclusively on `cost'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What further convincing does the government need of the concern the community and welfare sector has about this model? Nevertheless, the Deputy Prime Minister told the national Anglican gathering on Monday that it will proceed in this way. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw to the attention of the Senate an ongoing problem which doctors are experiencing with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme authority required prescriptions. Earlier this year, I asked a question of Senator Crowley, the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), concerning the changes which the government instigated on 1 December 1994 and which made it necessary for prior approval to be obtained from the Health Insurance Commission for all pharmaceutical benefits scheme authority required items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the minister's assurance that additional staff are employed by the Health Insurance Commission to ensure an efficient 24-hour telephone approval of any authority requests by mail, many doctors, particularly those in my state of Tasmania, are still impeded by the changed requirements. I have received many letters from disgruntled medical practitioners who are still battling with the new system because of lengthy delays in telephone approvals. Most doctors prefer to obtain telephone authorisation for such prescriptions because it enables their patients to take the prescription with them and to commence treatment immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the considerable delays in telephone authorisation continue, with doctors frequently having to wait seven to eight minutes. This amount of time appears to be the average delay. In some cases, the delay has effectively changed the patient's consultation time from a short consultation to a long consultation which incurs a much higher fee. On some occasions, doctors give the authority to their patient to post, in this case to Hobart. However, this action inevitably causes a delay in the patient receiving his or her treatment. Statistics have it that some patients do not bother to send the prescription to Hobart and so the treatment is bypassed, which is obviously a less than desirable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the NUS, the government sends every doctor a list of drugs which he or she can prescribe on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There have always been several drugs which require a special authority. For example, drugs such as Zoladex and Flutemide are specified for advanced prostate cancer only. Prior to December 1994, when these drugs were required a special prescription form was completed which gave specific details of the drug, the method of administration, the quantity and the illness. The prescription was handed to the chemist, who forwarded it to the PBS authorities and then received payment for the drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the prescription was sent without a specific illness marked on it and if it did not meet the PBS guidelines, the doctor was liable to pay for the drug, and, no doubt, also to pay a fine for misrepresentation. As stated, the drug was clearly marked on the list. The accepted purpose for which it was prescribed was delineated, as was the exact quantity that could be prescribed. The system worked very effectively and with minimum delay and disruption to both doctor and patient. However, since 1 December 1994, the new guidelines and procedure have been less than satisfactory, to the great dislike of many doctors and patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley's answer to my question on 9 February stated that the new regulations are to `ensure that the drugs are used appropriately.' To meet this requirement, the doctor must obtain an authorisation number from the Health Insurance Commission, prior to handing the prescription to the patient. However, in my view, there is no greater guarantee that this method is any more effective than the previously existing system. The main impact of this new system is that doctors are having to wait for lengthy periods on the telephone while permission is obtained, which only delays a consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is that doctors make clinical decisions about patients and decide to treat them with the most effective treatment. It remains quite ludicrous for a health insurance telephonist to instruct a doctor on the drugs he or she cannot use. The decision should be a clinical decision enabling doctors to prescribe the most modern and, more importantly, the most effective drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern which has been brought to my attention regarding authorities is that many patients are on increased quantity prescriptions which now require authorities. For example, somebody could be on a fairly inexpensive blood pressure tablet or, for that matter, paracetamol tablets and require extra amounts. The normal packets of many of these medications last them 15 days. However, from 1 December, the government introduced a requirement that patients cannot get repeats within 20 days. This means that every patient who is on an increased quantity of medication requires an authority prescription. This is part of the reason for the increased number of authorised prescriptions now being asked of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to urge the government, and particularly the minister, to again examine the effectiveness of the system and to institute any changes that may be necessary to streamline the process for doctors and their patients. I think it is certainly a retrograde step when doctors are not judged by their peers, in terms of the quality of their prescribing, but by a telephonist, untrained in medical issues, at the other end of a telephone line. I think the whole matter needs complete review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to deal with a civil liberties matter that I hope Senator Gareth Evans will apply his mind to because, quite frankly, it relates to a procedure which I think is totally improper and which clearly involves almost the `thought police' approach. I will explain it in this way: there is an arrangement whereby when a person arrives in Australia they have to go through a barrier and present their passport and various other travel documents. Normally there are very long queues but I think they are dealt with very efficiently and promptly by officers from Customs. They process matters which mostly relate to Immigration but, nonetheless, it is normally an efficient process unless the person going through happens to be someone whose name comes up on the computer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passenger arrival security surveillance system is a system whereby material about people has been fed into a computer. If a person's name has been put into that computer by the department of immigration then that person will be subject to further questioning, and there are various ways that passengers will be subjected to that questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, under this PASS system, there is an automatic trigger for the department of immigration. For example, if a person kept visiting locations which are high on the department's drug list, then that person would be likely to be asked where they had been and what they had been doing there. For some people who make a habit, because they have dual passports, of travelling outside Australia on a passport of another country, and then coming back into Australia on an Australian passport&mdash;which obviously would not have any arrival stamps from any other nation&mdash;they are also likely to be asked where they have been and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They then hold up the queue behind them and find themselves subjected to questioning that they might find offensive, intrusive and so on. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable that they should have to put up with it. However, it is not reasonable and it is grossly improper that, for example, a journalist who travels overseas should be repeatedly stopped at the barrier and asked such intrusive questions during a 15-minute grilling as, `Whom have you talked to while you have been overseas?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising this I remind the Senate that for about 20 years of my life I was a journalist. A journalist colleague of mine has been subjected to this kind of interrogation at the barrier. I might say that the people standing behind him in the queue have been less than impressed by that, but I am less than impressed by the fact that he was subjected to that kind of interrogation&mdash;not just once. It seems now to be a pattern, no matter by what entry point into Australia he has come in. It is no coincidence, it seems to me, that this journalist&mdash;who, to my knowledge, has an impeccable security record, has not been involved in any illegalities and holds an Australian passport&mdash;should in this extraordinary manner be continually questioned about matters like, `Whom have you talked to?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I note about this journalist is that he has had the temerity at times to write about security issues for the media outlet for which he works. He has written about ASIO and he has written about other security matters. From what I have seen in the papers lately, it is just as well we have had some journalists writing about some security matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps Senator Evans's apology yesterday about his incompetent handling of some security matters might be extended to the journalist who has been subject to this kind of improper interrogation at the barrier, for what appears to be no good reason and in an intrusive way which I believe to be a deliberate attempt&mdash;I will not say to terrorise; that overstates it&mdash;to let the journalist know that Big Brother is watching him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a nation where we should have thought police. It is not a nation where Big Brother, in the guise of a Labor government, should have any right or exercise any right to ask a journalist, on his return from overseas, `Whom have you been talking to?'&mdash;or any other intrusive questions that may relate to his profession. Naturally, when he was asked such a question he suggested to the officer, in polite terms, that he would not answer such a question and that it was improper to ask him. To that the customs officer, who was just acting on instructions from his computer, simply said okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to know is what sort of agency is feeding this kind of request through the immigration department into the passenger arrival security surveillance system? On whose authority are journalists being asked whom they have talked to? What is this government about in this sort of thing? If the government itself does not know and it is being done by governmental agencies without the government's knowledge or approval, then I think the government ought to smarten itself up and find out what its agencies are doing on its behalf. This is intrusive, it is offensive and it implies a clear standover tactic against Australian journalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If every journalist who is going to write critical things about the government or its agencies is going to be subjected to this kind of interrogation at customs barriers in Australia, I believe it is an absolute disgrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting listening to today's speeches in this section of our proceedings because every person who has spoken has pointed to some aspect of arrogance on the part of this government and the way in which it treats ordinary citizens. I wish to continue in the same theme but what I want to pick up is the way in which people are being treated by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy under FOI requests. FOI stands for freedom of information. What do we find from this government? Far from making information available so that people can participate in the public debates about important issues, we find&mdash;and I will go through a letter shortly&mdash;that the government is putting every obstacle in the way of people who apply for information so that they cannot get that information. The government makes it as difficult as possible for people to get the information on which they might base an argument, no matter how comfortable the government might be with that argument and with the debate that would ensue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter comes from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It is in response to an application from the Wilderness Society in Victoria for information in relation to various forestry practices: correspondence which passed between the Commonwealth government and the state government of Victoria relating to the 1,300 forest areas identified as being worthy of interim protection from logging by the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories late last year; and, correspondence between the Commonwealth government and the relevant state governments and business corporations and companies relating to current and future hardwood woodchip licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition and the Democrats may well disagree about the outcome of any debates which might arise as a consequence of that information but I think we would all agree that in entering that debate&mdash;and I see Senator Abetz nodding his head vigorously&mdash;in the first instance what we need is freedom of information so that all the information is on the table and the matter can be properly debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find? When the Wilderness Society wrote seeking this information, we find the Department of Primary Industries and Energy writing back in these terms. I would interpolate here that the Wilderness Society had also asked for the charge for the FOI to be waived. The department, among other things, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding whether to reduce or not impose a charge, the decision maker must, among other things, take into account whether payment of the charge, or part of it, would cause you financial hardship and whether the giving of access to documents is in the general public interest or in the interests of a substantial section of the public.</PARA>
<PARA>Immediately, we can see the deliberate obfuscation and the confusion which the department is trying to introduce between the two requests: the request for the information on the one hand and the request that the charge be waived on the other. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not clear from your latest correspondence whether your contention that charges should not be imposed is based on the fact that payment of the charges would cause financial hardship to your organisation or whether giving of access is in the general public interest, or in the interest of a substantial section of the public, or both.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is beautifully obfuscating these two quite separate issues. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should you contend that payment of the charges would cause financial hardship to your organisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and notice that this is to a public interest organisation, namely the Wilderness Society of Victoria&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you should provide details of your organisation's income, estimated weekly commitments and available cash in the bank or building society or like accounts as a basis for assessing the degree of hardship involved in the payment of the charges in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should you contend that giving of access is in the general public interest or in the interest of a substantial section of the public you should provide the following information in support of your contention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.details of the objects of your organisation and other information which would demonstrate a special interest in the specific subject matter of your requests, observing that intellectual or emotional concern for the environment is not enough to constitute such an interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Really, that means that only having either an economic or a political interest in the matter would bring it within the purview which would allow the department to provide this information. That draws a very narrow constriction around the availability of information which clearly, just from the general context of the debate which has gone on for many months over the woodchip licences and the exploitation of forests, would lead the department to know it was in the public interest. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether The Wilderness Society is the peak environmental organisation for the areas covered by your FOI Requests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is implicitly saying that if one is not in some way recognised as the peak organisation by some mechanism&mdash;and I am not sure what the mechanism is&mdash;then one is not entitled to get the information. Again, I would have thought that freedom of information meant that anybody who had a reasonable interest in getting that information for the purposes of entering the public debate should have access to the information. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether The Wilderness Society is the peak environmental organisation for the areas covered by your FOI Requests&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>How is that defined, and who decides?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and how its activities relate to these areas, observing that one request relates to areas of Victoria and the other relates to woodchip licenses in all states.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, those two are quite closely related. The letter then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.evidence that The Wilderness Society has been recognised by the Commonwealth as a responsible environmental organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that an individual or an organisation that has not been recognised by the Commonwealth can simply on those grounds have an FOI request refused? Those words clearly imply that that is the case. What does recognition by the Commonwealth as a responsible environmental organisation actually mean? It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such recognition could be in the form of regular financial grants for the general purposes of the organisation or grants in relation to projects and conferences on matters of environmental concern.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that all those conservation bodies that are not in receipt of Commonwealth grants under the various budgets are not legitimate organisations, and therefore can automatically be denied any freedom of information request? Clearly, that is implied in that paragraph. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.evidence that The Wilderness Society has been recognised by State governments as a body that should represent environmental concerns on advisory or similar committees.</PARA>
<PARA>So not only does it have to be an organisation which by some weird definition is a peak conservation organisation and is recognised as a peak conservation, it also has to be recognised by the Commonwealth as a responsible environmental organisation and has to be recognised by the state government. What a catalogue of criteria is put up in the way of the Wilderness Society obtaining this information! Further, the letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.details of significant submissions and/or studies by your organisation on forestry management and related issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this is an organisation which by and large is a voluntary organisation. It is working in the public interest as it sees it. One can argue about that, and I do not doubt both government and opposition would argue about that, but I do not think they would argue about the general proposition that according to its lights it is acting in the public interest, and therefore has a legitimate right to enter the debate and therefore a legitimate right to get the information. Finally, the letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.what benefits will flow to the public at large, or a substantial section of the public, from the release of the documents . . .</PARA>
<PARA>My God, talk about a catch-22! It has not yet got the documents and it is asked to provide the benefits which are going to flow to the public at large, or a substantial section of the public, from the release of those documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a reasonable case for supposing that those documents are central to the ongoing debate over how this federal government and various state governments have handled the forestry issue, but in terms of delineating, as is asked, precisely what benefits would flow, that places the organisation in an absolute catch-22 situation and provides a condition which could not be fulfilled. The letter concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A decision will be made on your request for remission of charges on receipt of the above information.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the processing of this FOI request would not go forward until all these conditions are met. The implication is that each and every one of those conditions needs to be met. I return to the point at the beginning: what an arrogant letter to write to an organisation which is widely recognised and which is seeking legitimate information in an area of its concern, clearly recognised in the community as an area of its concern, which is vital to entering this debate over forestry and woodchip licences. Clearly, this department has no intention whatsoever of providing that information. It is simply putting every obstacle in the way of those who might legitimately seek to get that information. Mr Acting Deputy President, I have read all but a couple of introductory and final sentences in this letter and I seek leave to incorporate the letter in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In commencing my remarks this afternoon, I note that I am in fact the third Tasmanian Liberal senator to be involved in this debate. I think it just follows the proud tradition the Tasmanian Liberal senators have established in this place of being effective and rigorous representatives for their state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the Green-Labor accord government experiment in my home state, our economy has been very fragile. After difficult and often gut wrenching decisions, the Groom Liberal government has made the necessary reforms to assist small business in my home state. My fellow Tasmanians are now acknowledging that, as witnessed by the substantial increase in support for the government in the latest poll and the fantastic support received by Peter McKay, the Leader of the Government, in last week's Legislative Council elections. A recent yellow pages survey shows that Tasmanian small business has defied the national trend by expressing increased confidence in their future. So small business, like Tasmanians generally, are now recognising the foresight and strength of leadership of the Groom Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the greatest threat to Tasmania's economic recovery is the federal Labor government itself. Of course, the latest budget rips out another $57 million of funding from Tasmania by way of increased taxes. The federal Labor government has walked over my state and over its rights with hobnail boots. It stops the harnessing of our resources; it seeks to drain our lakes, stopping our `clean green' electricity generation; it locks up over one-fifth of our land mass; it stops us from sensibly harvesting our forests; and it stops businesses such as Barry Arnold and Sons from being able to export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of all that, the Labor Party then gives us these paternalistic and, indeed, very condescending lectures about how Tasmania ought be run and the need to develop clean green niche businesses. One such clean green niche business was developed well before that became a trendy term, and before the Labor Party caught onto the term and got into the act. Of course, I refer to our aquaculture industry. This industry employs 2,000 of my fellow Tasmanians and that industry is now at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk to which it is being subjected is the potential adoption by Labor of a draft report by AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. AQIS considered the import risk analysis related to diseases associated with the importation of uncooked salmon product from North America. The import risk analysis, as presented by AQIS just this month, concluded that the risks of importing disease are negligible and that importation under the suggested conditions is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view is not shared by the Tasmanian government, our aquaculture industry or those associated with the recreational trout fishery. The reason is that the product under consideration is subject to at least 24 exotic diseases of concern to the salmonid and recreational trout fishing industries. At least eight of these diseases, some of which are the marine equivalent of food-and-mouth disease, are likely to be present in fresh product should importation be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AQIS document contains a number of deficiencies. In the final analysis, the AQIS conclusions underrate and undervalue the seriousness and acceptability of the risk inherent in the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is recognised as free of the major diseases of salmon and trout which are common in nearly every other continent and country. Many of these exotic diseases have serious consequences in other countries. They can cause high levels of mortality and frequently reduce the productivity of fish farms. Some cannot be satisfactorily controlled, while others require vaccination or high levels of antibiotics to reduce losses to a viable level. The industry in my state is saved from all that because it is disease free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relatively high water temperatures in Australia mean that salmon and trout are at the upper end of their range. The stress this causes, together with the fact that many fish diseases are more severe in warmer waters, makes Australian fish very susceptible to these diseases should they be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged that Australia has world trade obligations. Under GATT those obligations require importing countries such as Australia to justify health related restrictions in a transparent scientific and technical way. The risk analysis process used by AQIS does fit the guidelines. However, countries free of the diseases in question&mdash;and clearly Australia is such a country&mdash;are also expected to take into account the feasibility of control and eradication and relevant economic, social and environmental factors. Additionally, if there are gaps or shortcomings in the scientific or technical information, countries are expected to be conservative and err on the side of caution. The AQIS document fails to take these very important aspects into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk analysis fails to take into account the feasibility of control and eradication of the disease if introduced. The simple fact is that eradication is not a realistic expectation, but AQIS attaches little importance to the long-term consequences that would result from disease outbreak. The risk analysis fails to take fully into account relevant economic, social and environmental factors. A disease outbreak would have a serious long-term effect on Tasmania's economy. Aquaculture and recreational fisheries are expanding and creating major employment opportunities in areas with no alternative options. A matter of interest as well is the potential effects on world heritage areas and the native fish populations within Tasmania. They are ignored by the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk analysis ignores considerations available to Australia's stance under GATT, the World Trade Organisation and OIE guidelines. Australia's obligations under GATT and the World Trade Organisation clearly allow for Australia to take full account of the consequences of disease outbreak and of our current freedom from the major diseases of salmon. AQIS has not done that. The risk to native fish, including those in the world heritage areas, has not been considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparisons with the importation of red meat from countries with foot-and-mouth disease are very interesting. The criteria used by the Australian government in protecting the grazing industry against foot-and-mouth disease are very different from those being recommended by AQIS for protection against salmonid diseases. This double standard exposes my state, in particular, to an ongoing socioeconomic risk in the case of salmonid diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AQIS report acknowledges that while the risk of introduction and establishment in Australia of exotic diseases is currently very low, the risk is not zero. It is therefore essential that full consideration be given to the relevant socioeconomic factors that would follow the entry, establishment and spread of the diseases&mdash;24 have been listed and eight are probable. Therefore, the low probability of disease establishment does little to distinguish between safe and unsafe importations and is not the critical factor in determining whether an import should proceed or be banned. This highlights the relative importance of the feasibility of disease eradication and of the potential economic, social and environmental implications of importation in the event of a disease outbreak. It also highlights the importance of the susceptibility of a disease outbreak to eradication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian atlantic salmon industry is confined entirely to my home state of Tasmania where it provides major employment in some of the more regional and sparsely populated areas where unemployment is very high. Recreational trout fisheries extend beyond Tasmania to several mainland states. The potential for social disruption as a consequence of disease entering recreational trout fisheries in Tasmania alone has not been fully evaluated. Based on the consequences of the recent discovery of European carp, they are expected to be on a similar scale to the disruption of the salmonid industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trout fishing industry in my home state of Tasmania is a very substantial industry. It attracts a lot of interstate and overseas visitors for the one purpose, that is, fishing for trout in our rivers and lakes. The possibility of disease being introduced could devastate that wilderness experience, which is another thing that the Labor Party keeps lecturing Tasmania about by saying, `Sure, we're locking up vast tracts of your land, but at least you can sell yourself as a tourist state.' When they make their final determinations, AQIS and the federal government ought to be considering that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that Senator Tierney would like to make a contribution to this debate, so I will conclude my remarks at this stage. I plead with the government to protect Tasmania's aquaculture industry against importation of product from North America, not on the basis that the Tasmanian industry cannot economically compete with the imports but on the basis that, if these products are allowed in, there is a risk of disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that disease gets into our aquaculture industries, they will be devastated. The fish will need to be handled more often and they will need to be submitted to treatment by antibiotics and other chemicals. Production will be more expensive, and, therefore, it will be less economic for my state to be able to compete with North American supplies. The fish will also lose their status of being clean, green and not subjected to chemical and other medication. I also plead with them to take into account the potential fate of our native fish population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I began by saying that the Labor government has completely neglected my state. This is an opportunity for the government to do something positive for my state, and I encourage it to protect the livelihood of the industry which looks after some 2,000 Tasmanians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a story for the Senate about small business in Australia. Small business is under immense pressure to survive, but the Hunter region in my home state of New South Wales is currently leading the small business owners of the nation to take a stand. Small business is certainly down, but it is not out. Owners of small businesses in the Hunter are organised as never before to raise their heads above the ruck and to attract Australia-wide media and political attention. At the core of their anger is the belief that supermarkets and chain stores are driving their businesses into the ground. This is no idle, overblown claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group of small business people in the Hunter region has kept accurate figures on business closures in the area and they have case files that should rock the ALP government. The battlers in mainstream Australia are in dire straits because in 12 years the Labor government has not kept pace with the changes in retailing and it has not made an appropriate legislative response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last four years in the Hunter region, one business has closed every day. One business every day! Who are the casualties of this crisis? We are not talking about glamour businesses here. We are talking about the traditional family retailer from any main shopping centre or street strip: fruit shops, butcher shops, hot bread shops, delicatessens, chicken shops, bottle shops, gift and novelty shops, newsagencies and even chemists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alarming reality is that nearly 3,000 small businesses have stopped trading in the Hunter region alone. This situation is alarming for one region, but the big picture right across Australia shows all the signs of the decay of our commercial sector. We are talking about a huge slab of Australia's economic activity. There are over 800,000 small businesses in this country and they employ 47 per cent of the work force; this is what is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own area, the anger has been simmering beneath the surface for some time. It has now broken out and the people in small businesses are desperate for some effective action. These people will wield whatever political and media power they can muster, and their efforts so far have achieved national prominence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Newcastle mayday call rally on Friday, 19 March focused the attention of federal, state and local government on the problem that small retailers have. So it should, because the federal minister, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), constantly denies in this parliament that the problem has three dimensions: it has a local dimension, it has a state dimension and it has a federal dimension. Senator Schacht was flushed out of his ivory tower to attend the rally in Newcastle, together with the shadow minister for small business, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). The Prime Minister told him to get up to Newcastle, because the Prime Minister was, of course, in damage control mode after his insulting jibe to small business, `It's never going to get better.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the night, the program was covered by the Nine Network's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, ABC Radio National and ABC TV News. Many regional networks also took the story. The message of the Newcastle rally was strong and it focused on the real need for a rescue mission for small business in this country. Three main grievances were raised at the rally: nnrestricted trading hours; predatory pricing and misuse of market power by large chain stores; and unfair legal agreements between shopping centre managements and their small business tenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record the text of a sign displayed outside a fruit shop in Newcastle last week. I think it sums up, in essence, the three dimensions of this problem. The sign read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customers . . . we are closing down today: Reason 24 hour trading and price wars between supermarkets have halved our turnover and we are losing money every week. The Council, our landlord still wants us to pay the rent of $1,000 a week on the empty space next door. They will not help. Total rent on this shop $2,468 a week. What choice do we have? 12 more on the dole Monday.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It sure is, as Senator Campbell says. This message should, I believe, make all governments sit up and take notice. There is another story which shows the craziness of current business practices that are driving many small businesses in this country to the wall. Take the story of Peter Craig from Lake Macquarie Fair: he is the baker who cannot bake bread. Why cannot he bake bread? He cannot bake bread because of the shopping tenancy agreement that he had to sign to stay in business there. He was asked&mdash;or I should say `told'&mdash;to let a competitor bake it. He is also restricted from selling tea, coffee and a number of other products as part of his lease agreement with the shopping centre management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction to the problems and the plight of small business people&mdash;such as in the two examples I have just read&mdash;is inadequate and disappointing. In April, he wrote to the small business people in Newcastle to wash his hands of responsibility. He said it was a local and state government issue and that supermarkets were the best places to meet modern demands in retailing. He said he had no federal power under the Trade Practices Act to stop misuse of market power or unconscionable conduct by large chain stores. Three strikes and Senator Schacht is out! He has put himself right out of the game as far as small business people in this country are concerned. His record shows a total lack of interest in acting at the federal level. He showed that in April and it has not improved since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During budget week, he told the Senate that he would set up a working party. He wants small businesses to provide him with examples of predatory pricing and misuse of market power. He should have come with me last Sunday down to the Mayfield Shopping Centre: he would not have needed a report, all he would have had to do was walk along the street to see that all the businesses were shut and that, nearby, a huge supermarket outlet with 18 people on checkouts was having an enormous through-put. A thriving shopping centre has been decimated in a short period by this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Action is needed at all levels of government. We need it at a local level, at a state level and particularly at the federal level. We call on Minister Schacht, who has just arrived in the chamber, to stop beating about the bush. He should stop blaming other levels of government and past policies and should use the powers that he has to reform the act in the way he knows he can, in order to do something about this situation to help small business in this country compete on an equitable basis and thus survive. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is frankly outrageous. The opposition, which does not have a policy idea to rub together, seizes on anything, no matter how irrelevant, in order to try to undermine the Australian economy. Fortunately, for the people of Australia, the economy is in the groove. It is in a phase of strong, steady and sustained growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March quarter figures and the balance of payments figures that have come out today are proof of that. Those figures illustrate that the economy is consistent with budget forecasts. It is on track for the 1994-95 estimate of 4.75 per cent of growth year average in GDP. There are two reasons why that figure is achievable. There is a significant upward revision in growth for the September and December quarters. We believe that the pick-up in growth in the June quarter, based on a number of performance indicators and particularly on the capital expenditure survey, with an expectation of business investment of seven per cent, will show that we can expect to deliver growth which is strong, sustainable and steady. This is exactly the sort of growth that this economy needs. It is the sort of growth that we can deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a question about, effectively, the current account. We have had this debate in the last three days in question time. The question does not seem to have changed, despite the information that has been given. While the actual number in the forward estimates for the budget that we have put down is the same year on year, nonetheless there has been a fall in the current account. The figures that have come out today illustrate that that, too, is on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the interesting thing about the March quarter figures which bears repeating in this chamber is that exports grew by 2.8 per cent during the March quarter and imports grew by two per cent, which is to say that we are exporting more than we are importing. The national expenditure and national output figures have come closer together. We can be confident that the current account is turning around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that what we have from today's quarterly accounts is figures that encourage people to have a great deal of confidence in the forward estimates in the budget, which shows strong, steady and sustainable growth. The opposition does not seem to have challenged that. It has pointed to a weakness of the current account in the overall economy. But, again, by those figures, exports in the last month outpaced imports. That is also a very positive sign.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Some honourable senators would be aware that I have vivid memories of a visit to India in 1993. Probably because of that visit, I was interested in recent discussions about growing opportunities for Australia to trade with India. Minister, has there been any evaluation of the major trade mission you led to India in February this year? If so, what does the evaluation reveal about the real opportunities for Australian business in India and what should we be doing to make the most of those opportunities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="612" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a good opportunity to deal with this matter, being in the presence of such a distinguished trade delegation. The trade mission to India can be used to illustrate some of the things we are trying to achieve through our program of trade missions, our attempt through that to enhance our trade in India, as Senator Colston referred to, and the broader question of our trade profile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">India is quite a good example. It illustrates how we are trying to fit trade missions into broader trade promotional activities: studies, like that done by the East Asia Analytical Unit on our trade opportunities with India; the concerted business promotions, like the trade and investment outlook conference; the opening of Austrade offices in Calcutta, Madras and Bangalore; and fitting those in with sector specific missions to India, like the one Senator Schacht led on construction, the one that special trade representative John Button led on telecommunications, and that which David Beddall led recently, as a consequence of my visit, on coal mining and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that the Indian mission illustrated, and which is an important trend, is the cooperation between the private sector and the states. It was a mission that we shared with the Western Australian government, through the Deputy Premier, Hendy Cowan, and with the private sector, through those on our mission and others from the Australia-India Business Council and through the academic community. In particular, it was about trying to build on that momentum to change the image of the Australian economy, to illustrate the diversity and sophistication of the economy, and to address some of the continuing errors in perception of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business mission featured banking, insurance, telecommunications and engineering as well as our traditional strengths in mining and agriculture. We are trying to build on our strengths, as David Beddall's subsequent mission on coal mining and technology illustrated, while adding to it through new areas like telecommunications, other communications facilities, infrastructure, construction and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did get some interesting joint ventures in those areas during the course of the visit. These changes are being increasingly reflected in our trade profile. We see an increase in the percentage of our exports of sophisticated goods and services, the most rapidly growing area of our exports being manufactures followed by services. But we need to do more. India is a very good case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The East Asia Analytical Unit report said that India's economic growth output suggests that we could get a doubling of Australia's annual exports to India by the year 2000 which, if I recall the figures correctly, would mean an extra $1 billion of exports. But we will need to diversify our exports to maintain our market share. We cannot just do it by doing better in our traditional areas. We need to move into the new areas of growth in Indian imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was one of the factors that motivated the composition of the trade mission and the priorities that we set. We did an evaluation of the mission. We are trying more and more to evaluate missions when they are conducted. The business people on the mission, in particular, emphasised the value of the mission for networking and for establishing a credible business presence. That seemed to me to be an admirable reflection of the fact that they are taking a long-term view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did get some short-term benefits with joint ventures and MOUs, but they are not the key measures. The key measure is the extent to which these missions contribute to changing our trade profile, building on our strengths, and broadening the basis of our trade. The evaluation suggested that, while no one measure ever solves all our problems, it has made a significant contribution to some of the issues that Senator Colston and others have raised as a result of their visits to India in the past and which the research says we need to continue.</PARA>

I am very keen for the government and for the sporting community to work closely together with the common aim of stamping out racism in sport. Earlier this month, I wrote to the Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, Mike Fitzpatrick, to ask the commission to take strong and constructive action on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the ASC to work closely with sporting organisations, with ATSIC and with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to develop a comprehensive strategy to combat racism in sport. I am pleased to say that the commission board met last week and has agreed to put a comprehensive strategy in place and to do so quickly. The strategy will include education programs and Aboriginal sports participation programs, including providing special assistance to NSOs with high Aboriginal participation rates. The strategy includes modifying the codes of conduct in sports, including ensuring that racist sledging is an offence and subject to punitive action.</PARA>

The reasons we have done that is that we recognise there is a need to get all of the facts out on the table and plan the appropriate response. That is why the PSA has been asked to inquire into this. It should be recognised that it is not simply an issue solely about bank charges. It also involves questions about the social security payments system.

I can go to a number of examples of demonstrably greater competition between banks and where consumers have reaped the reward. The government does recognise the need for some clearer intelligence on this issue of obligations to the wider community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jones for his question, particularly for highlighting the annual tragedy of suicides and accidental deaths by firearms. On the Commonwealth level, we do have a commitment to reduce the number of unnecessary firearms in the Australian community. That has always been the major reason for the Commonwealth government's determination to promote a common approach on a state and federal level to gun control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our starting point is that we have the strictest import controls on firearms in Australia as compared to anywhere else in the world. In particular, those firearms designed for military purposes to kill people are prohibited imports. Recently, my colleague the Minister for Justice announced that import controls will be tightened even further on pistols capable of being converted to submachine guns and also on ammunition for which there is no reasonable use in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure in that context all senators would agree that there is no reason, for instance, to allow the importation of tracer bullets, explosive bullets, incendiary bullets, armour piercing penetrator ammunition, or pistol ammunition designed to penetrate the soft body armour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been further recent developments as well. At the most recent meeting of Australian police ministers in Hobart last week the Commonwealth proposed, and the states and territories in fact agreed, that we should review the major restrictions that were approved in 1991 to ensure that they are in place and working well. All jurisdictions were concerned to ensure that, in particular, tight controls in one jurisdiction could not be thwarted or undermined by lesser controls in another. I should add that this review will not mean any lessening of controls anywhere. It is intended to re-emphasise the minimum standards, which of course are necessary for effective gun control, but any jurisdiction can, and most do, have much stricter controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Jones raises a question of public health and community safety. It is unacceptable, for instance, that more than 450 people die annually from suicides and accidents from firearms.

It says that it is very proper to have a balance between work related and occasional care&mdash;up to 12 hours for those families.

<PARA>I am amazed that, in relation to that answer, the government does not seem to understand that mainstream Australia rejects totally the promotion of activities that are unsafe not only from a medical point of view but also from a moral point of view.

I say to Senator Murphy that this is a matter of public debate. This document has been put out in his party's name, financed by his government and supported by his health minister. It is a matter of controversy, one of particular controversy in his home state. His constituents might wish to know whether it has his endorsement. </PARA>

<PARA>I welcome Senator Faulkner's statement that he intends to stamp out racism in sport in Australia. I welcome it most at this stage because the AFL has started an initiative in the last few months&mdash;it has been going for a while but has been intensified in the last three or four months&mdash;as a result of certain occurrences. I am sick and tired of the portrayal around Australia, and the minister said this in his answer today&mdash;whether intentionally or not&mdash;that the problem of racism shown towards anyone in Australia refers only to Aboriginal groups; and to some extent, as brought out in other debates, to the Jewish community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other communities such as my own community, the Italians, the Slavs, the southern Europeans, the Asians, the Germans too, I suppose, whatever ethnic group in Australia, have suffered racial taunts from time immemorial. The debate seems to have gone away from that completely. If there is any talk of racism in Australia, it is only about the plight of the Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press has to be taken to task too. I am sick and tired every time there is a crime, such as a drug bust, of the press reporting, `X, an Italian from Naples'. Why an Italian from Naples? The press does not report, `Person A, an Australian from Griffith' or `an Australian from Canberra'. It is always ethnic people and where they come from that are described in that way. The press should look at itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have spoken to other ethnic groups and other ethnic members of parliament, both on our side and on the government side, not only in the federal sphere but in the state sphere. It is certainly a concern that they have. While we are looking after the interests of Aboriginals as far as racism is concerned, I believe that we have certainly lost our way with other groups. Those groups are mostly made up of migrants that came to Australia between the two world wars, although most of them came after the Second World War. They might have integrated more into the Australian community than previous migrants did, but racism is still there, so when racism is spoken about, debated and legislated for, I believe it should cover all groups, not just two small minority groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I seek to explain relates to the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases which, on Monday 29 May, held a public hearing in this place. It was taking evidence from the Criminal Justice Commission as part of its overall inquiry. This was to be its last hearing. It commenced at around 8 o'clock and finally finished at about 1.15. Somewhere between 1 o'clock and 1.15, a question was asked of one of the representatives of the CJC that related to an affiliation on his part to either the Labor Party or Labor lawyers which I ruled out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst my ruling the question out of order was correct in technical terms, there was dissent from Senator Abetz, who was the person who asked the question. In accordance with the standing orders, it would be technically correct for me to have proceeded to a private meeting. That was not the case. We were right at the end of the hearing. All of the evidence had been given by the CJC; indeed I had asked on a number of occasions whether there were other questions relating to the evidence and the submission of the CJC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I ruled the question out of order was that the question had been previously asked on 16 March at a hearing in Brisbane. The question was also asked by Senator Abetz. This debate commenced on page 507 of the transcript of the hearing of Thursday, 16 March at the Brisbane hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases. It concluded on page 518, so it was not as if it did not have some reasonable airing. After some debate, Mr Barnes, the person to whom the question was directed, answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I indicate that I am not a member of the Labor lawyers, and am not and never have been a member of any political party. That is all I wish to say, thank you.</PARA>
<PARA>I go to the question which Senator Abetz actually asked the CJC to take on notice. On 26 April the CJC provided a response from Mr O'Regan, the Chairperson of the CJC in Queensland. It is addressed to the secretary of the committee and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Humphery</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During evidence before the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases on 16 March 1995, Senator Abetz requested that a matter raised by him be placed before the Commission at its next meeting. During a discussion towards the end of the hearing, Senator Abetz made the following request:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">    . . . what you might also like to take on notice&mdash;to finish my questions on a fairly provocative basis&mdash;is on a number of occasions I have heard an allegation that the CJC is full of Labor lawyers. Are you prepared to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">    make or provide an analysis of those lawyers who have been employed in the CJC who have had a known association with the Labor Party or Labor lawyers or, indeed, the Liberal Party or National Party. I know that I have been provided with, if you like, anecdotal suggestions. It may be of benefit if the air could be cleared in that regard . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Regan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This request was considered by the Commission at a meeting on 21 April 1995. Commission staff are chosen on the basis of perceived ability and integrity. The Commission keeps no record of the political affiliations of its staff and does not consider that it would be appropriate to request staff to provide such information in order to comply with Senator Abetz's request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances, the Commission has resolved that the information requested by Senator Abetz should not be provided. Would you please convey the results of the Commission's consideration of this matter to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter was circulated to all members of the committee. It is a very important part of my explanation about what happened finally at the public hearing on Monday night. On page 513 Senator Abetz said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This committee has been provided with the allegation that the investigating officer in the Cape Melville incident, Mr Barnes, is a Labor lawyer.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat Mr Barnes's answer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I indicate that I am not a member of the Labor lawyers, and am not and never have been a member of any political party. That is all I wish to say, thank you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue relates very specifically to the government's budget proposal to impose a wholesale sales tax of 12 per cent on certain builders' hardware and building materials. It is for us to adjudge the impact that that will have on housing affordability in Australia and, of course, the subsequent repercussions for employment in the construction industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people will be affected by the Keating government's 1995-96 budget, and this aspect is nothing more than a blatant attack on the great Australian dream. It is an attack on home ownership; it is an attack on those Australians who rent their homes; it is an attack on those who choose to renovate and maintain their existing homes and, as such, it will have a particular effect on self-funded retirees and elderly people throughout Australia who are very vulnerable at a particular financial period in their lives. These new taxes and additional taxes will have a major effect on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed new building tax will hit more than three million Australian households per year. The 1995-96 Keating budget will result in considerable stress for home owners and tenants and will have major repercussions for the construction industry throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Budget Paper No. 1, we see that the explanatory memorandum details that the particular wholesale sales tax is on builders' hardware and certain building materials used mainly in the completion of buildings, which will become taxable at the concessional WST rate of 12 per cent from 1 July 1995. WST will apply to presently exempt goods such as screws, nails, paint, putty, adhesives, wallpaper, ceramic and glass floor and wall tiles, taps, nozzles, handles and joinery such as prefabricated kitchen cupboards and office partitioning. That just about picks up everything that most Australian households have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to look at page 4.20 of the revenue estimates for this year. I note in particular that indirect tax&mdash;sales tax revenue&mdash;will rise this year to a collection of $14,160 million. That is an increase of $2,580 million, an increase of 22.3 per cent in the sales tax collections for this year. That, of course, includes this additional new budget revenue item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has an attitude problem with housing. He told the Collingwood Football Club on 11 May that he considered Australia's spending on housing needed change. Speaking later in Canberra, he said, `Banks simply resorting to housing lending is, I think, a bad thing.' At the last election Mr Keating promised to keep home purchase within the reach of those who wanted to buy their home and to keep mortgage repayments at affordable levels. This could not be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might remember that at the last election Mr Keating did a deal with the Australian people. He promised to deliver tax cuts if they delivered him office. He was returned to office. What did Australians get in return? More taxes&mdash;$3 billion a year of more taxes. There was higher taxation of unused long service leave and annual leave lump sum payments; increased tax on credit unions; increases in fringe benefits tax; an increase in the general rate of wholesale sales tax; extra sales tax on wine and cider; an increase in petrol excise; an increase in tobacco excise; and a departure tax increase. That was previous budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about this year's budget? The promised tax cuts did not eventuate, but we certainly got increases in fuel taxes; increases in existing wholesale sales tax from 20 per cent to 22 per cent; increases in vehicle sales tax; an increase in company tax, FBT and superannuation; a higher Medicare levy; and the introduction of this particular issue that we are addressing, the introduction of a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on building hardware, with the possibility of it increasing to 22 per cent. So all of that pre-election promise area was forgone. The Prime Minister's credibility is down the chute. It is nothing more than electoral fraud and straight electoral dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of it, particularly in this area, is that housing affordability continues to decline under a Keating government. The evidence of that, of course, has been the interest rate uncertainty and strategy of this government after the last year or so. That mistrust of Keating has kept the housing market in decline. There have recently been large falls in housing finance commitments which will continue to flow through building approvals over the next few months. Housing finance commitments for March were a whopping 31.4 per cent down on March 1994. Mr Keating has betrayed the average Aussie more than any other section of the Australian community, and he continues to decimate middle-class Australia. The Keating budget, by taxing the range of building materials, has penalised home buyers for the government's policy failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) in all of this? He is the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Mr Howe certainly is implicated in this latest attack on housing. He has been promising us a major housing statement since February of this year. It slipped from February, to March, to April, to May and now it is obviously slipping into the election rhetoric. It has slipped off the agenda. It is not going to appear before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask how much clout does Mr Howe really have. He has been totally ineffective and should resign. There is no social justice coming from Mr Howe and the left wing at all. To see this, we only have to look at the estimates questions I raised in the last round. We asked a whole series of questions about urban development; about the some 16 policy objectives that were under way; and about the seven consultancies that had all reported nine months late and what the results were. We asked about the three-year $2 million review by Jenny Macklin, who was on Mr Howe's staff. She has now gone off as the Labor candidate for Jagajaga. The review has folded after 16 months. The money is all spent. The department has to pick up the tab and finish off the work, which has been a total waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can identify the problems as being those in home ownership, renovation on homes and crisis accommodation. There will be, as a result of this, price rises for new homes. Landlords will be forced to raise rents in the private sector, and that will have a consequential effect on Australian homes. With affordability conditions declining, there will be increased pressure placed on the rental market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners, who traditionally rent or, in many instances, renovate and maintain their home, will be hurt. This makes a mockery of other government initiatives in all of the areas that affect rental assistance and rental programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building industry has been deliberately, almost vindictively, hamstrung by the Keating government. This proposed 12 per cent sales tax on building hardware is another savage blow to an industry already doing it tough. The repercussions of this impost will be felt throughout the housing sector. Builders will be forced to rationalise their businesses, and this will result in job losses. There is confusion within the industry surrounding the tax treatment of different forms of prefabricated components and building materials, whether constructed on site or in the factory. Industry associations have suggested that the government ought to go back to the drawing board on this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the estimates have been widely different. The government has underestimated this matter very severely and has a figure of some $215 million in the budget.

I find it unusual that the MBA and the HIA were the ones that were supporting you lot with your GST when you wanted to introduce a 15 per cent tax on everything. That is exactly what you wanted to do&mdash;not only up front but on a continuing basis. That is what you wanted to do. Don't come in here and preach to us about taxes. You really have run up the white flag on this issue because you are policy free on a whole range of issues, and all you can do is come in here and oppose. This is really a pathetic effort on your part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of this particular wholesale sales tax really brings into line many of the products that did not have wholesale sales tax on them before. Indeed, some of the wholesale sales tax on such materials was brought about by you people. Some products are taxed at 21 per cent and some are taxed at 11 per cent. But you were going to apply a 15 per cent tax to the key factors in the building industry&mdash;the bricks, mortar and timber&mdash;but you could not even work out how the 15 per cent would work. You really could not work that out at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have applied a wholesale sales tax of 12 per cent on certain items. It is worth noting, in terms of the disparities in the wholesale sales tax treatment of certain goods, that fittings such as sinks, toilets, baths and towel rails are currently taxed at 11 per cent, but associated taps, nozzles and shower heads have been exempt. This particular measure will also partially restore the tax treatment of office partitioning, which, prior to the court decision of 1990, was taxed at the then general rate of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the building industry, the hypocrisy of Senator Tambling coming in here and raising this matter about some taxation measures simply defies the logic that he is unable to recognise the fact that to run a government you need revenue. You actually have to generate revenue to provide the things from a social justice point of view&mdash;he purports to come in here and represent middle Australia and every other member of Australian society with regard to housing&mdash;and also in the delivery of community services. We brought our budget into surplus. Not only did we do that but in terms of retargeting and refocusing moneys, $86 million was allocated to ATSIC for the next four years for urgent housing needs for indigenous Australians. There are a whole range of other financial measures which you people have no policy and no position on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tried desperately to find some opposition policy with regard to where it actually stands on housing and what it is actually going to do. We knew when it went to the last election that it was going to whack 15 per cent on everything. I went to the library to try to find some policy document. The best I could do after some time there was to find half a page. It is entitled, `A home for every Australian'. It was going to make it at least 15 per cent dearer to buy a home. This particular wholesale sales tax puts only 12 per cent on some items; it was going to whack 15 per cent on the lot, not 12 per cent on some. We have exempted certain things. In particular, the areas that are exempt from the tax and will continue to be exempt from the tax are the most important items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to be concerned about the people seeking to build homes in this country. What is the most important factor to them in terms of building a house? We all know what it is. It is interest rates. What has happened to interest rates since this budget was brought down, even with the proposition of a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on some building materials? Interest rates are trending down. There are offers now being made by certain banks, particularly some building societies, where they are trending down. But you people wanted to say that after the budget interest rates were going to go up. They set hurdles so high. They said, `This is what the government has to jump over&mdash;a $2 billion deficit, maybe as high as $6 billion.' But then we came in with a surplus and we still kept interest rates down. That is what is important to the home building public of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has come in here with some nonsense motion for debate about the unfair and unjustified consequences of wholesale sales taxes. I guess he could find an excuse for not having any tax because that seems to be the opposition's policy. On all tax matters that have arisen out of this budget, opposition members have come in here with speeches opposing them. It is quite possible that any person could dream up an excuse for not having any tax. As I said before, what would they do about government? How would they deliver the social services to people&mdash;the community service obligations that a government is expected to deliver? They could not do it. They have never in this place addressed those matters in terms of debating proper policy. It is just ridiculous that Senator Tambling would put this proposition up for debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only opposition policy that I could find about delivering goals for housing is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our goals for housing</EMPHASIS>. In government its key goals will be to restore home ownership. How will they do that? The best way&mdash;I am sure those opposite have jumped up and down enough about it&mdash;is with interest rates. Secondly, they will operate economic policies which ease pressures on interest rates and inflation. What has this government done? We have done exactly that. We have brought inflation down, we are keeping it down and we are keeping interest rates down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling also raised the matter of the decline in housing commencements. That decline occurred after record building levels that had never before been achieved. They are levels that most statisticians and most people with any reasonable economic knowledge have said were unsustainable. They are now back to levels that are more sustainable and representative of the underlying demand for housing. Again, it is totally hypocritical of the opposition to come in here and make claims of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been major assertions and claims about how much this will increase the cost of a house. They are talking about thousands of dollars. The builders are saying that when they put in a quote they will whack on 12 per cent because they do not know what it will apply to blah, blah, blah. That is typical of some people. It is typical of how some rather dishonest people in the industry, be they builders or retailers, have chosen to distort the results of the introduction of the wholesale sales tax and use it to their advantage to get a price increase in their activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about some of these products to which we have applied a wholesale sales tax. I do not hear the opposition present an argument on the basis of how nails, screws and bolts are packaged in some of the BBCs and other retail outlets of the world. I do not hear opposition members say that when buying a particular measure of nails they have to buy a certain sized, prepacked amount.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be a major discrepancy between the impact of the tax on building hardware as claimed by the Government, and as claimed by Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasurer has estimated the tax will increase the price of building an average house by $400 and raise about $215 million. The Housing Industry Association claims that the tax rise will increase building costs by about 1.2 per cent ($800-1000 on an average house), alterations and renovations by 2 per cent and repairs and maintenance by 5 per cent, with a revenue gain of at least $550 million, double the Treasury estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The higher estimate, if correct, would raise questions about whether the building industry could absorb the tax rise without accelerating the industry downturn and job losses. The Budget forecast of a 13 per cent downturn in private investment in housing would be very sensitive to the tax impact, and I am concerned that if the tax impact has been underestimated, the forecast downturn could also be understated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist us in assessing the real impact of the tax proposal, I request details on the basis on which the Treasury revenue estimates and price projections were calculated, and the extent to which Treasury estimates that building and renovation activity might slow and employment in construction fall as a result of the tax rise. I also seek advice on the extent to which continuing cutbacks in funding of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement are likely to affect public sector housing starts in 1995/6.</PARA>

We have been told by many of his ministers&mdash;they have been wrong&mdash;that this is a balanced budget. This tax, which increases the cost of housing for everyone in Australia, is part of a balanced budget. I will never put an end to that lie while anyone opposite speaks in this place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the household budget. One might want to sell some of the family jewels or the family silver in order to balance the family budget. It will not end up being a balanced budget if the asset values go backwards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Qantas has been an issue for four years, and we obviously have not found a suitable buyer for it. We have sold part of the Commonwealth Bank. Issuing shares will bring the price of the others down. So it will not be all that sweet to get those assets sold. It is all very well to have something to sell, but, as those who deal in property know&mdash;I am sure that Senator Sherry knows all about this&mdash;in order to make a sale, a suitable buyer has to be found. That is one stupid thing that Senator Murphy mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made another silly remark. I do not want to spend time on this; I have more important things to speak about. He said that we on this side should be worried about the packaging of nails at hardware stores. His remarks show that Senator Murphy has not been in a hardware store for a long time. The last time I was looking for nails, I discovered that one can buy packets of five. Perhaps he wants nails to be sold singly. We may get to that. If he asks for a special favour, he may get it.

That is correct, if the warehouse happens to be in the city. If the warehouse is already in the country and the goods are transported as wholesale goods, the wholesales tax will be charged at, for instance, Kalgoorlie, and freight costs will be included.

Freight to areas at least 500 or 600 kilometres away from the main source of supply for bricks can end up costing as much as the bricks themselves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to get back to the subject of building materials. The government has told us that this tax relates to certain materials only but it uses the term `materials such as'. I would like the government to be more definite. We have been told it includes materials `such as' nails, sealants, bathroom vanities, windows, doors and all those sorts of things but I want a definite list. It is my guess that when we get that list we will find out that it is probably only the bulk materials such as bricks and tiles that do not carry this tax increase. If this government were to be so fortunate as to be in government for the next 30 years, it would probably try to extend the tax to those materials as well. That is the sort of thing for which this government should be condemned. </PARA>

But the cost of the materials is only part of the cost of the increase in the kitchen fit-out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the asset sales are an interim measure. They are a short-term way of accomplishing a surplus&mdash;a very important surplus&mdash;in the achievement of which this measure, the increase in the wholesale sales tax, will be a very important component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt, when the opposition deals with the budget legislation over the coming weeks&mdash;or months, as they may turn into&mdash;it will oppose any tax increases because it is still miffed about losing the last election and is adopting the role of the spoiler. But if it opposes the tax increases while at the same time saying that we should produce a budget surplus, I challenge the opposition to name where it would cut expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should nominate where it is going to cut expenditure. It will be very interesting to see how the opposition will come up with a budget surplus for this year in its alternative package, if it dares to present one, without any tax increases whatsoever. We have the absurd position of the shadow treasurer, Mr Costello, saying, `Okay. We will vote against the tax increases. Some of them might get through. If we are subsequently elected to government we will keep them'. That is a ridiculous position. The general public is starting to wonder about the contortions that the opposition is getting itself into over tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition says, `We are macho. We do not agree with tax increases but, if they go through, we will keep the money anyway'. The opposition is trying to have it both ways. Any responsible government putting up a responsible budget must have some degree of flexibility in its fiscal approach. If that means that from time to time there are tax decreases in certain areas or tax increases in certain areas, then that inevitably occurs. I am a person who believes it is very difficult to give an absolute commitment that there are not going to be any tax increases anywhere. That is not a practical option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach on this measure&mdash;$215 million from the increase in the wholesale sales tax&mdash;aside from addressing some inequities in the wholesale sales tax area, is a very important and very central component of the budget. If the opposition turns a surplus into a deficit by opposing these measures it is on its head if interest rates start to go up. It is on the opposition's head if the dollar starts to slide. As part of the government I know that we will be happy to confront those opposite politically on the consequences of their irresponsibility. We have an opposition with no alternative budget strategy and no alternative package of policies. It boasts that it will keep them hidden until the next election&mdash;which it will lose. </PARA>

He said, `I tell you what, I would rather have the recession than the recovery'. That is borne out by the facts. Overall, housing activity in this country has dropped by about 30 per cent in the last year. The March 1995 figures issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that private housing fell 7.8 per cent in February to its lowest level since January 1992.

Kingston Joinery was one of those firms. The firm employs 30 people, but it is very seriously looking at putting off at least four, two of whom are apprentices. The reason for that action is the 12 per cent hike which the company did not expect. It came out of the blue in the last budget. It is going to increase the firm's taxation and reduce its profits. I looked at some of the company's figures and it will be going into debt after having a reasonable surplus. We know that this is going to have a great impact on unemployment. There will be a cut-back in apprenticeships. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to hear those opposite talk about increased costs as a result of taxation increases on some items that go into the building of homes and houses&mdash;and, of course, those two things are different. However, they have not raised any question about other costs, and there are one or two other costs that are very significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians view owning a home as something very important. It has been the goal of most Australians to purchase and live in their own home at some stage during their working lives. Certainly, many home loan ads that have been shown on television target young working couples, with or without young families, and one could say that it is part of the Australian way of life&mdash;and it has been for some time. Even the opposition, when it was in government, sponsored the ideal of home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home ownership levels in Australia rose rapidly in the late 1940s and 1950s, and since the early 1960s home ownership levels have remained steady at around the 68 per cent mark. This level of ownership is equal to, or better than, most countries in the developed world. It has been and remains this government's objective to keep home ownership affordable for most Australians. Affordability is affected by inflation and home loan interest rate levels, not by the odd bit of wholesales sales tax on nails and other items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling clearly must be struggling with the government's success at keeping interest rates and inflation rates down, because all he can grasp at is talking down the housing industry and some minor wholesale tax changes which will affect by around $500 the cost of a house and land purchase worth, say, $100,000. That is certainly much less than the housing industry has indicated, and I am certainly suspicious of its calculations. I am sure that most Australians are happy to know that this budget is providing the framework that ensures home ownership remains affordable, by ensuring that cost of living increases are kept to a minimum and that interest rates are kept as low as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many things go into the cost of a house, land being a very substantial value item. I am surprised to see that the HIA estimates that revenue from this wholesale sales tax on some building products will be about $500 million, instead of the government's budget estimate of $215 million. Perhaps the building industry is in better shape than even the government has estimated. I would certainly like to hear how the HIA arrived at this figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that these wholesales sales tax changes are restricted to a small number of building items. Most of the building material used in building construction remains exempt from this tax, including: timber, bricks, roofing tiles, stone, sand, gravel, concrete, cement, bitumen, electrical fittings, doors and windows. If Senator Tambling is so upset at the alleged impact this tax will have on the housing industry, why were he and his colleagues eager to embrace not so long ago a GST that would have substantially increased the cost of housing in this country? I know that Senator Tambling is hoping that everyone will forget about the GST, but we won't and they won't. Senator Calvert made the point that there were going to be some tax cuts on certain items, like fuel&mdash;as though the tax on these items we now discuss, which are only part of the large budget, were the only increases that would have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home ownership is part of a broader strategy to ensure that all Australians can achieve a better standard of living. It is no good providing opportunities for Australians to own their own homes and then not provide an adequate environment for that home and the family that lives in it. The better cities program aims to improve the economic, social and environmental development of Australia's urban regions. For example, areas like the Brisbane-Gold Coast growth corridor must be provided with proper planning and infrastructure support to ensure that home owners living, or planning to live, in that area are not neglected. </PARA>

But you have got to raise the money before you can spend it. Let us get away from the cheap political point scoring, and let us stop talking the housing industry and economy down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National Audit Office has identified some areas in which the Insurance Superannuation Commission needs to do some further work. I have some very specific concerns relating to this. One area in which I believe the ISC needs to do more work is derivatives. Well before the Barings collapse, I gave notice of public warnings about the dangers of derivatives. In fact, as chair of the superannuation committee of the Senate, I wrote to the ISC and the ISC responded with a discussion paper. But I believe that that is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the gearing of superannuation investments must stop, and must stop immediately. The ISC must respond decisively in the light of the potential risks that imprudent derivative investment can pose to superannuation investments. In doing so, I urge the ISC to canvass legislative proposals to address this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> In fact, the potential for excessive derivatives exposures to challenge long-term confidence and superannuation has been a longstanding concern of mine. I have given a number of public addresses on this issue. This issue must not simply be lumped into the too-hard basket. The experience of the 1980s must surely remind us that waiting for the horse to bolt, and counting our losses once the stable is empty, does not put bread and butter on the tables of ordinary retired Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enormous resources have been poured into developing the SIS regime, which is now recognised as a world leader in its field. In fact, the tapestry of law of which we are the weavers is not simply to authorise the prosecution of breaches. More importantly, it is to encourage compliance and avoidance of breaches. We cannot allow superannuation investments to be speculative. I place on the record my desire to see within a year a thorough examination of the appropriate role of derivative investment and the development of subsequent legislation addressing, in particular, issues such as the prohibition of gearing of superannuation portfolios and exposure limits for derivative investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I had the opportunity of meeting with Mr Stephen Smith MP, of the House of Representatives Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee and the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee is to take evidence tomorrow from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission on the use of derivatives. I have outlined my concerns to Mr Smith and pointed out to him the relevant gaps which must be filled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of education to date, the role of the ISC in educating those involved in superannuation according to the industry has been less than satisfactory. I acknowledge that. The government has millions of dollars to provide education on superannuation, and this money must be spent appropriately. My concern is the use to which the ISC has put its money. I acknowledge that it has produced a trustee guide book, but I question the extent of consultation undertaken in the preparation of this document. For example, 95 per cent of funds are mum's and dad's funds to which only five per cent of the SIS legislation applies. The guide book has attempted to cover two very diverse groups of trustees, and neither group has been served well. The ISC must put more work into its communications. This is an area in which the Australian Taxation Office superannuation group has been highly commended by industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these few observations from the point of view that I hear many on and off the record comments on superannuation. It is imperative that the regulator in the vital and emerging field of retirement incomes is constantly reviewing and improving its communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there are issues that the regulator must look at. For example, to what extent are trustees responsible for monitoring the use of derivatives by their investment managers? How can trustees, particularly member trustees, have any hope of assessing the risks of these highly technical and intricate investments? Further, how does section 52(2)(f) impose an obligation on trustees in relation to the use of derivatives? Is trustee responsibility a realistic route for derivative regulation? These and other vital issues must be addressed by the ISC. Given the nature of superannuation&mdash;that is, lifetime savings of individuals for their retirement&mdash;do we believe that a direct approach to the regulation of derivatives would be adequate, or should there be a more definite prudential regulation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues. For example, in the event of a major derivative loss under the current law, which entities would be required to account for the events resulting in the loss&mdash;the trustees, the investment manager or the auditors? Further, what happens if a large super fund crashes in the way that Barings did? I believe we do have a prudential regime aimed against that, but a derivative is a new product for which there is no legislative prescription. What would be the consequences of a fallout? How will this be handled?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe we should distinguish between over the counter derivatives and exchange traded derivatives for regulative purposes. Is it possible to distinguish between these two groups for the purpose of the regulations, because they have  diverse consequences in terms of their application in the event of loss. It is possible, with certain types of derivatives, to lose more than the actual investment. This is one of the far reaching consequences of my concern about using derivatives, certainly in circumstances where they are used for other than taking or hedging a position. The real difficulty lies in distinguishing between a hedging and a speculative function. I ask the government and the ISC to further address this important issue in the light of ensuring an absolutely tight prudential regime for the protection of our future retirement incomes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the Auditor-General Report No. 2 1994-95, because this report deals with the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 and it makes many recommendations. However, there is a recommendation that it did not make which was made elsewhere and which has been implemented. I refer to temporary modification declaration No. 14. As I understand it, it is in conflict with the views of the committee on which Senator Watson sits. This modification raises some concerns with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two modifications. The first one is to waive the disqualified persons status of persons with minor  dishonesty convictions, which will enable such persons to be trustees, investment managers and custodians of superannuation entities and responsible officers of corporate trustees, investment managers and custodians of superannuation entities. A minor dishonesty conviction is not defined, is not a legal definition and is entirely at the discretion of the insurance commissioner. It seems to me that that is an incredible way to legislate. I do not know how they could do it better, and I do not know what the agenda is behind allowing people with minor dishonesty convictions. Maybe it is only those pinching under $100,000 or, judging by the way major corporate cheats seem to be treated these days, perhaps you have to be a major corporate cheat to be regarded as having a minor dishonesty conviction. I view this with some concern, particularly in light of the very well informed opposition to this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other change under modification declaration No. 14 is to permit disqualified persons under part 15 of the act as a result of having been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty&mdash;not a small offence but any offence involving dishonesty&mdash;to continue to act as trustees, investment managers and custodians and as responsible officers of corporate trustees, investment managers and custodians for up to six months without being liable to penalty. Reasons are given, but quite frankly I do not find them to be persuasive. I think the government should explain to us in better terms why this sort of thing has been snuck through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Gazette</EMPHASIS>. That is where this change of some significance appeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 May, this matter was raised and concern was expressed. Obviously there are things such as minor convictions. There is bus fare evasion. I acknowledge that it would be ludicrous if a person who was caught for scaling on a bus or train by accident as a result of failing to buy a ticket was no longer allowed to be a trustee or an investment manager. But nothing says what this `minor dishonesty' conviction really is. Legal advice is that the term `minor dishonesty' has no legal meaning. In fact, the term is strictly interpretive and is so wide that it could mean anything to anybody. In the absence of any guidelines to the insurance commission, I think it is grossly improper for this temporary modification to be changed in this way. This does not just affect peanuts. The insurance superannuation pool at the moment is something like $200 billion, which is expected to increase to $600 billion within the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important that people in control of this kind of money be totally and absolutely honest. I have great concern that the ISC has gone down this track. This move is not well thought out and I hope some corrections will be made to make it much clearer exactly what the ISC is about. On the recommendations made by the audit office, there is real concern in this report by the audit office about some matters which I want to raise very briefly. Among the key findings of the audit office is that there is an absence of a compatibility check between the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and the Australian Taxation Office superannuation records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Auditor, checks would have revealed a number of discrepancies in both databases and highlighted delays in the processing of Insurance and Superannuation Commission returns. He also points out what I think is a serious problem. Superannuation funds were claiming the concessional tax rate without first having been granted compliance status by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is permissible to anticipate that compliance will be given, the ANAO considers more follow-up action needs to be taken to ensure that the benefit of the tax concession is restricted to eligible funds complying with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Something like 79,000 funds lodged returns. The audit office found out that something like 7,817 funds which lodged returns with the ISC did not lodge income tax returns with the ATO. This, the Auditor-General says, `could have serious consequences for tax revenue'&mdash;at worst who knows what&mdash;`at least deferring receipt of tens of millions of dollars.' The Auditor says that the tax office is following up to determine whether there had been a breach of lodgement requirements and to collect whatever revenue was payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the audit office had not compared the databases, further revenue losses would have been realised in addition to the loss of interest on the deferred payments. It strikes me as absolutely extraordinary that there has not been proper comparing of the databases of the tax office, which provides the tax concession, and that of the insurance commission, which provides the status for the tax concession. I am glad the Auditor-General has established this. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is a need for the ISC and ATO to finalise arrangements for the unique identification of funds (currently by tax file number) to avoid totally undesirable restrictions on the meaningful exchange of data between them.</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of this is that, with the introduction of Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992, superannuation became mandatory for most Australian workers and moneys held in superannuation funds are expected to treble to about $600 billion by the year 2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has the responsibility for ensuring that the proper prudential safeguards are applied to the funds into which the compulsory superannuation contributions are paid, as well as being responsible for monitoring the compliance with legislation by regulated superannuation entities. It seems extraordinary that with this enormous need for effective supervision, the prudential requirements, in terms of the integrity of the people handling these funds, are to be diminished by the latest ISC temporary modification declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office also found that, in some areas, Insurance and Superannuation Commission activity had been insufficient to meet its responsibilities fully under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and that, in the audit office's view, the then current planning for its increased scope under the SIS arrangements would have limited the effectiveness of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in meeting the government's stated policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office considers that good cooperation and communications between the ISC and the ATO are critical and considers this to be an area where more work should have been done, and needs to be done, to protect Commonwealth revenue. A comprehensive compatibility check of ISC and ATO superannuation records had never been conducted. The audit office has recommended that an annual compatibility check of these records be conducted.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I appreciated the insert which the Australian National Audit Office thoughtfully placed in the report. It gave the key findings, the background to the report, the planning for SIS, the ISC audit program and the ISC-ATO interface. Senator Baume has also mentioned that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite extraordinary, is it not, that some 7,817 funds have lodged ISC returns but not tax returns, leading&mdash;in the words of the Auditor-General&mdash;to potential loss of significant revenue. But that is not the only potential loss. I will not go into the merits or otherwise of the proposals that the government is seeking to have implemented through the award system and through the system of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, a question does arise as to the constitutional validity of some of the suggestions being made. Questions arise as to whether it is appropriate to appropriate workers' wage increases into a superannuation fund, against their will. These funds are recognised as the workers' only for the purposes of taxation. I will go into that later. I wish to raise, for consideration by the chamber and the Auditor-General, a rather prudential matter that should be borne in mind. There are some doubts about how well the superannuation funds will fare, in the commercial sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EPAC has just released an interim report on private sector involvement in infrastructure. Senator Gibson would be well aware of that, as would other honourable senators. The Kelty report on regional development proposed that airports be sold to institutional investors such as superannuation funds. The EPAC report advocates full cost recovery through user charges for all public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through privatisation, the government is shifting off budget most of its commitments to supply public works for essential services. Increasingly, roads, airports, communications, water, electricity, et cetera will be supplied by private investors such as superannuation funds. Thus the workers, through their compulsory employee and employer contributions to superannuation, are being forced to pay for essential services which used to be provided on a subsidised or break-even basis by governments. In effect, the superannuation levies actually represent an additional tax designed to make up for the decline in public utility services provided by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the superannuation levies are not shown as taxes in the national accounting statistics, the official figures will show that the ratio of tax to national income is actually falling. That is a nice twist of the figuring, is it not? By shifting public works off budget more of the budget is freed up for actual vote buying schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to investments. Henry Aram, an investment adviser, has pointed out that this shuffle of public assets into private hands at inflated prices may mean that long-term investment returns are not there in 30 years. That should be considered. As billions of dollars&mdash;the Auditor-General puts a figure of about $600 billion on it by the year 2000, which is a lot of money&mdash;accumulate in a limited number of investment funds, the dangers of investment manager group-think increase. With fewer and fewer dominant players in the bond and equity markets, there is less stability in the financial system as larger masses of money can move in and out of stocks on the say-so of fewer people. The potential for instability, market rigging and insider trading must weaken the efficiency of Australia's capital markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not proceed any further with that because I think I am straying a little from the topic at hand, which is the Auditor-General's report. I felt that I should make those points because these are relevant considerations when regard is had for the need for prudential schemes to ensure the proper compliance of superannuation funds with the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efficiency of superannuation funds to deliver to their members the benefits which the government considers will be delivered must be considered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall continue the remarks I was making earlier today in support of the censure motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, for misleading the Senate and the people of Australia over the use of land fund money available through ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Kernot was giving her opinion on paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), she described paragraph (c) as a political agreement. Paragraph (c) is a description of the ATSIC board briefing paper revealing that an agreement had been struck between the Prime Minister, ATSIC and a group of indigenous land fund bill negotiators on singling out the Northern Territory for special treatment over the next two years. This seems a very polite way of saying that there is a real discrepancy with paragraph (b) where on 9 November 1994, Senator Gareth Evans stated, `The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the Land Rights Act.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I detailed some of the statements that had been made in the Melbourne hearing of the Senate select committee on the land fund in January this year and how almost every single speaker from those groups felt that they had an equal right to land that would be distributed under the land fund. In contrast to this, I remind all senators of Senator Collins's statements on 16 November 1994. This has already been quoted extensively by my fellow coalition colleagues. He said that it is a nonsense scenario that exclusively or largely over the next three years $21 million of ATSIC funds would be used to purchase land in the Northern Territory to the exclusion of everywhere else in Australia. I would suggest to the Senate and indeed to other people who are listening that that has indeed happened. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am prepared to bet Senator Chamarette a huge sum of money. . . that the prospect of ATSIC's land acquisition funds exclusively being devoted to land purchases in the Northern Territory is a highly unlikely scenario indeed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am most grateful to Senator Panizza for calling a quorum so that people can hear what I have to say about this very important matter. I regard a censure motion as one of, if not the, most gravest actions that can be taken by the Senate in respect of a member of this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have considered what has been said on both sides of this debate. I have been here all the time, I think, and have been able to calculate in my own mind, on balance, how I will vote on this matter. I am very well aware of the fact that on this occasion, in a numbers sense, this is an important matter, but more so because of the nature of a censure motion itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That censure motion is directed at the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins. It deals with what Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins have said in this chamber about the vital issue of the moneys that are going to be allocated for land acquisition and land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also present for almost all the previous debates about this matter. I was influenced by what Senator Gareth Evans said and by what Senator Collins said, but particularly by what Senator Evans said about what had or had not been agreed with the Northern Territory. On 9 November 1994, as the motion states, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, as is explained in the motion, the decision by ATSIC will cause a dramatic increase in the amount of land claimed under the Land Rights Act. I recall the amendments that were being proposed to the land fund legislation at the time. The government said things which created a false impression and would have created that false impression, surely, amongst its own members, in hindsight. As has been said in this chamber, in hindsight, things did not turn out the way we were led to believe they would turn out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, to me, is a very serious matter. When I first came here I used to take at face value what ministers said, until I realised that the words that they can use could create a false impression. So it was necessary to have a very good look at the words to see whether the creation of that false impression was as a result of the words that were used. Sometimes it was; sometimes it was not. In recent years, with responses at estimates committees, responses to questions in this chamber and, furthermore, responses during the committee stage of bills, one really has to think carefully about what is said in this chamber. Indeed, even if you did think carefully about what was being said in this chamber, it was very difficult to understand what the ministers were saying. But in this case they are making a direct statement. On 11 May 1995, Senator Collins said that Senator Campbell was wrong to say that $20 million out of $24 million had been allocated for land acquisition in the Northern Territory. He asserted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal issue is that $42 million is available to ATSIC for land acquisition, Senator, not $21 million.</PARA>
<PARA>He thereby sought to represent ATSIC's decision in a better light but in fact it was in an inaccurate light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been canvassed here. In my view, it created a false impression. But in my view you must look at the whole of the actions of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, together. You must ask yourself: what has been the combined effect of their actions? As paragraph (c) of the motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ATSIC Board Briefing Paper now reveals that an agreement had been struck between the Prime Minister, ATSIC and a group of `indigenous Land Fund Bill negotiators' about singling out the Northern Territory for special treatment over the next two years for land acquisitions from ATSIC's land acquisition and land maintenance program.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Senator Collins knew very much about that arrangement, that understanding, that the Prime Minister came to. I do not know whether the Prime Minister's representative in this chamber, Senator Evans, knew about that. But the combined effect of it was that we were all given a false impression. I am not saying that Senator Evans and Senator Collins deliberately misled this chamber. I have considered what is before us. The motion is for censure. In my view, once you use the words `mislead the Senate'&mdash;that actions were misleading to the Senate or that actions misled the Senate&mdash;you must go to the word `censure'. That, in my view, is the way to go to ensure ministerial accountability and responsibility to this chamber, whether or not the ministers deliberately misled the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I believe this is part of an overall effect that results from the actions of the Prime Minister as well as the actions of Senator Evans and Senator Collins, I feel that censure at this stage is not really the appropriate way in which to proceed. I have circulated an amendment to the censure motion which I now move:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit "censure", substitute "expresses its profound disapproval of the actions of".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit "for misleading", substitute "which have had the combined effect of giving a false impression to".</PARA>
<PARA>So the amended motion would read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">expresses its profound disapproval of the actions of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, which have had the combined effect of giving a false impression to the Senate and the people of Australia over the use of Land Fund money available through ATSIC when . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It repeats the three points that were made in the original motion which were proven by Senator Chamarette and by the opposition speakers, Senator Campbell, Senator Tambling, Senator Troeth, Senator Panizza and Senator Ian Macdonald. They have established their bona fides in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the giving of a false impression by ministers warrants an expression by the Senate of profound disapproval, and I have submitted that amendment to the Senate. I am in two minds about this because of the fact that, at the time, it did have an effect on those of us who were present as to what way we would go in respect of amendments to the legislation. I was in two minds about the use of the word `censure'. I felt that, at this stage, one could not censure the Prime Minister for paragraph (c) because, I believe, it is the combined effect of the action of the Prime Minister and the actions of his ministers that has caused a situation which has given a false impression to the Senate which deserves an expression of profound disapproval. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the considerations that have been expressed by Senator Harradine. Censures should not be used lightly in the Senate or their value will be depreciated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know Senator Chamarette also thought carefully about the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the discussions, however we seek to call them&mdash;in a secret meeting, or in a deal or whatever; we do not need to go into the semantics of that for the purposes of this debate&mdash;in terming this censure motion. The coalition gave significant consideration to those matters as well. We are indeed convinced that the actions and the combined effect of the actions are indeed worthy of censure. However, the history of censure motions in the Senate&mdash;which I was able to remind myself of by reading the seventh edition of Odgers during the luncheon adjournment&mdash;is that ultimately their effect is political. They do not necessarily mean that ministers have to go out to Yarralumla and deliver their resignations the minute a censure motion is passed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Censure motions, to be frank about it, have a political effect. They have this effect if they are supported by the Senate and there is an interest in them by the public at large. I presume in this case there will be enormous interest, particularly amongst Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, in this debate and in the outcome of this debate. I suspect that, in the community more broadly, there will be some interest in it. So the Senate firstly spending some time debating this matter and then passing a vote on it will have a political ramification of some sort. In effect, the use of the words `expression of profound disapproval' fall into a category a notch or two below what would be a formal censure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Half a notch, Senator Harradine says by way of interjection. The effect is probably more semantic. It would be if these amendments were agreed to. I indicate that the coalition has reservations about this. I suspect it is more important, after some hours of debate on this matter, that the Senate expresses this disapproval, be it called a `censure' or `profound disapproval'. I have greater reservations about inserting the words `which have had the combined effect of giving a false impression to'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to explain why I believe the combined effects, but particularly the effects of paragraphs (a) and (b), misled the Senate and therefore the people of Australia&mdash;particularly paragraph (b), where Senator Evans stated that the allocation of new moneys would not cause there to be an increase in the land claimed in the Northern Territory. The officers of the department&mdash;Mr Dillon was in the advisers' box this morning&mdash;know that this debate has been gone over and over again and that we can talk about new money or old money, ATSIC money or land fund money. But Senator Evans was quite precise when he talked about new moneys going to the land fund would not lead to an increase in land purchased or claimed under the land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of it is that the new money going to the ILC&mdash;regardless of money that goes to ATSIC&mdash;has caused this situation to arise. Of course, he said that it had been agreed with the Northern Territory that that would not happen. I fully respect&mdash;as Senator Troeth and I think a number of other speakers have said&mdash;the right of ATSIC to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot raised this issue of self determination and said that we are criticising self determination. If she listened carefully to the debate&mdash;and I know she is interested in it&mdash;she would know that this is not criticising ATSIC's right to make that decision. It has that power. This parliament gave it that power. We have the responsibility to criticise ATSIC when we think that is necessary and to support it when we think that is necessary. That happens more often than not with ATSIC from time to time. It is a body that receives an enormous amount of publicity no matter what it does. It tends to get a lot of negative publicity, either deserved or undeserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not seek to reflect on that decision-making process. What we seek to reflect on, and why it is important to say and to prove that the ministers did mislead the Senate, is that the whole debate arose because we were contemplating a legislative structure that we said, Senator Chamarette said and the Northern Territory government said would have the effect of this outcome that is now upon us&mdash;that is, there would be a significant increase in the land that could be converted to inalienable freehold title in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that it was a serious concern and that there needed to be equity across Australia in terms of what benefits Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders received from the new land fund. The committee that went around Australia in December and January highlighted that. We had a lot of people coming to us in the southern states expressing their land needs and their concept of their own dispossession and how they perceived that could be redressed with the benefit of the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were the reasons for the concern. We had different reasons, but they were the reasons for the concern. So when we debated with both the Leader of the Government and Senator Collins, on the occasion of 16 November in particular, we kept on pressing the government on this point: why are you allowing the three-year transition? Is it but a coincidence that the sunset clause in the Northern Territory land rights legislation falls at the same time that the transition period ends? Of course, the Northern Territory government thought it was more than a coincidence. I thought it was more than a coincidence. Senator Chamarette thought it was more than a coincidence. I suspect any member of the government who would be frank about it would tell you that it was, of course, not a coincidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this chamber Senator Collins in particular chose to tell us that it was a transitional period, a transitional measure. When he was asked whether it would create this outcome, he said, `No, I'll bet you all the money in the world'&mdash;and we have heard that many times today&mdash;`that that won't happen.' I wanted to just reinforce, because it has not been mentioned in the debate thus far, the number of times that Senator Collins in a very short space of time used the words `transitional arrangements'. On page 3109 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 16 November, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an absolute fact that these are transitional arrangements, unabashedly so, and they are part of an agreement that was reached after a lot of negotiation with representatives of Aboriginal organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on that same page, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuation of ATSIC's land acquisition until 1996-97 will ensure a smooth transition. During this period ATSIC will have time to finalise and put to rest all of its final purchases and land management arrangements that are already in place.</PARA>
<PARA>There he is giving you the impression and leading you to the view that this is just tidying up some deals, tidying up a few loose ends. He is contemplating there will not even be any land bought up, that we will just be finalising some deals. He said before that, that applications had already been received for the 1994-95 year and all the funds had been allocated. He was saying that between now and 1996-97 it will be transitionary and just tidying up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 3110 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on the same day, in response to a point made by Senator Chamarette, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She refers to double deals being done. That is utter nonsense. What the Northern Territory government was legitimately concerned about was that under the existing arrangements, if an additional and substantial sum of money was provided, effectively doubling the land acquisition capacity of Aboriginal people, this would lead&mdash;particularly in depressed times when land prices on pastoral properties are down and when there is no question that there are pastoralists who would be attracted by offers to exit their properties&mdash;to some sort of huge land acquisition in the Northern Territory, with the consequent conversion meaning that significant parts of the Northern Territory pastoral industry would disappear.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the concern that Senator Collins expressed. That was the concern that the Northern Territory government had. I do not think it was actually Senator Chamarette's concern. I think Senator Chamarette would be genuinely happy if a much larger part of the Northern Territory was declared inalienable freehold. We would probably have to differ on those outcomes, because Senator Chamarette's idea of balance between conservation, Aboriginal land holdings and economic development is a little bit different. Senator Collins then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is an entirely unwarranted concern . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is all around the debate as to the structure of the legislation. I want to keep returning to that. We said, `You are creating a legislative structure that will have this outcome'&mdash;not a potential outcome&mdash;`and it needs amendment, it needs reform, because that would be unfair to Aboriginal people across Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will, as I said this morning, ensure that for generations to come&mdash;and I, hopefully, do not exaggerate that. If you shift $20 million or you literally multiply by a factor of 10 the amount of money that goes into the Northern Territory in one particular period, you will, of course, magnify the money that will need to go into the Northern Territory to manage that land for generations to come. There will be&mdash;to use, I guess, an electoral word&mdash;a malapportionment which will live on for generations. </PARA>

In fact, you can rest assured it is an "unwarranted concern" that there will not be'&mdash;I think, to quote Senator Evans&mdash;`a land rush. Don't worry about that.

We know that is a statement that is misleading. He may not have sought to mislead, but it certainly is misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My strong feeling is that the people of Australia were misled. It was more than just giving a false impression. The government knew that this was a potentiality. It had the opportunity to reform its bill. It had the opportunity to amend it over many hours, if not days, but every time we put forward our arguments about why a better legislative structure would be fairer to Aboriginal people, we were accused of being racist, anti-ATSIC and anti-Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what has happened is that the scheme that has been created and defended by this government in a misleading way has generated an outcome that will discriminate against the majority of Aboriginal Australians. It will ensure that the majority of Aboriginal Australians, that is, the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who do not happen to live in the Northern Territory&mdash;and those who do are represented so well in this place by Senator Tambling&mdash;will be discriminated against because they will, over many generations to come, have fewer resources going into land acquisition and management. That is why this misleading is an important matter. </PARA>

I believe strongly that the matter is worthy of a censure motion and of the term `misleading the Senate'. I also believe that the Prime Minister and some individual people within ATSIC are integrally involved in this action. I believe there is evidence to mount a very strong case that should be supported by my colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret the failure of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and ATSIC, in response to questions at estimates last Friday, to refuse to give information and also regret that the government has refused to table the documents requested in my call to order of last Monday. It means that we were not able to provide more information to convince Senator Harradine that rather than having the word `censure' in the motion, it should have read `expresses its profound disapproval of the actions of'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure Senator Harradine that I also think that `expresses its profound disapproval' is appropriate. But I do feel that censure is warranted because of my response to the second half of his amendment in which he substitutes the words `which have had the combined effect of giving a false impression to' for the words `for misleading'. It is that part of his amendment that I have greatest difficulty with. I believe that if it was only for the combined effect of giving a false impression, we could actually have another strong disapproval motion on the continuation of `the combined effect of giving a false impression to' that has been provided by Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Collins in this debate. They have continued to give a false impression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that because of the complexity of the matter, people simply think that the motion reflects a lack of knowledge and no particular intent to mislead. That is not what I believe is stated in the motion. It is not saying `for intent to mislead the Senate' in the original motion to which Senator Harradine seeks amendment. We are actually saying `misleading'. We are not implying or stating intent; we are stating effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties&mdash;again, I am self-analysing the failure of debate to convince Senator Harradine that the motion does not require amendment&mdash;is that perhaps by focusing on simply the words that Senator Collins used on the occasion that is cited in the motion rather than the actual words he used in the debate, we may have failed to make the point that a repeated false impression has been given and it is not simply able to be dismissed as an ignorant false impression.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the right of reply on my motion. I intend to do it by commenting on the remarks made by Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Campbell and Senator Kernot. In refusing to accept the validity of this censure motion, Senator Evans basically gave us three arguments. His first argument was that the ATSIC board that met and made this decision was an independent authority which makes its own decisions about the matter. The fact that he may have expected a different outcome on the basis of the competition of interests throughout Australia amongst Aboriginal groups does not indicate that the government has had any role whatsoever in the decision that the ATSIC board has made. That is my understanding of the remarks that he was making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans was also defending the remarks that he made in the debate. In a sense, he was defending the indefensible. In the censure motion there is a quote from Senator Evans which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the Land Rights Act. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The censure motion has said that that is a misleading statement because the decision by ATSIC will cause a dramatic increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act. Senator Evans, and also Senator Collins when he was arguing on behalf of Senator Evans, has argued that technically the government is quite in the clear because the commitment to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory was that the new funds available through the Indigenous Land Corporation and in the legislation would not be available within the Northern Territory and would dramatically increase the amount of land that could be claimed. After all, the money would go through the ATSIC board and it is perfectly legitimate for ATSIC moneys to be used under the land rights act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refresh the memory of Senator Evans and Senator Collins. They may not be aware that when the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration met to discuss the Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund Bill 1994 on 23 September 1994 a question relating to this matter was given to Mr Dillon following the raising of it as a matter of concern by Mr Hatton, a minister of the Northern Territory government. Mr Dillon said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the $21 million that is going to ATSIC is not money that is basically the result of this land fund; it is money that was always inside ATSIC's budget. In that sense, the Prime Minister's commitment has been followed to the letter. The new moneys that the government has allocated to this land fund are not available for conversion of pastoral leases in the Northern Territory. ATSIC's moneys that were always there, as Mr Hatton has pointed out, will be available; but, as he has also pointed out, clearly there will be other priorities for ATSIC commissioners to address apart from acquisitions in the territory.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. We know that there has been an agreement between the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That is not a matter of dispute. That agreement was to the effect that no money would be given through the Indigenous Land Corporation funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate might be aware that the Indigenous Land Corporation funding in the legislation is set up to include the ATSIC moneys. To follow the letter of the law, while it is included in the $45 million per year annual draw-down from the mythical $1 billion land fund that the Prime Minister set up, it is for three years to be held separately in a split that is covered by one of the clauses in the legislation. Senator Evans very accurately pointed out that I opposed this. I did not see any reason why we should have a split to ATSIC. I also did not see any reason for the Prime Minister agreeing to the demands of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory that any land fund moneys should not be available for use under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act until its sunset clause in 1997. The Greens also did not support the sunset clause for 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell pointed out earlier, the opposition and the Greens do not see eye to eye on this matter. We just happen to agree that a betrayal has been made of commitments by the Prime Minister to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory government and to all the Aboriginal people who do not happen to be in the Northern Territory by the resultant decisions that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate Mr Hatton's response to the quotes I just gave from Mr Dillon. They are very interesting. The Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hatton, would you like to respond?</PARA>
<PARA>There are then some intervening matters which are not relevant. Mr Hatton then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. Firstly, I do not believe that the Prime Minister said `new funds under this scheme.' He said `funds under this scheme.' We keep getting these extra words slid in later on in our discussions. We knew that this was not new money going to ATSIC, but you have created an indigenous land fund for the purposes of acquiring and managing land. The Prime Minister has said that that money from that fund would not be available under the Aboriginal land rights act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the money was used in ATSIC for the purpose of acquisition of land, why would you not, with the new legislation, consolidate the funds anyway and use the Indigenous Land Corporation as the vehicle, rather than having a duplication of vehicles in the process of indigenous land acquisition and management? Why do you need a three-year transitional period if the money was for land acquisition? Why do you not use the Indigenous Land Corporation, which you are creating for that purpose? Why does ATSIC need to continue to do this process?</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear why it does. Not only did the Prime Minister give a commitment to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory; he obviously gave some form of commitment to ATSIC. Presumably, he gave it to the people who had most to lose by that agreement with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory; that is, the Aboriginal people who might benefit from the ATSIC land acquisition allocations in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to make it clear that the Northern Territory was not going to be disadvantaged relative to the rest of Australia by having to receive money from the ILC which it could not convert to inalienable title under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. It would merely not be able to take advantage of something which is clearly a privilege that only the Northern Territory has; that is, a land rights act which enables its land to be converted to inalienable title under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. So the rest of Australia is already at a disadvantage. The Northern Territory has had the advantage of being able to have land rights legislation. I wish that the rest of Australia had been able to have it, because it is really an act of this federal government that prevented universal land rights from coming across the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being aware that the Northern Territory had this advantage&mdash;that it had the capacity under the land rights legislation to convert its land to inalienable title&mdash;it was again this federal government that allowed a sunset clause to be put in for 1997 which prevented it from going beyond that point. So we have a privileged position, which it deserves, in my view, relative to the rest of Australia. Now, because that preference will cease in two years as a result of an act of this federal government to remove those rights, the Northern Territory is being compensated by having a further advantage over the rest of Australia. We need to bear that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have diverted somewhat because it is such an important point that I believe we need to make. Basically, Senator Evans has said that ATSIC is independent and that it did not do this as a result of any prior negotiations, deals, agreements or commitments. It spontaneously decided to do this very inequitable distribution of land funding. It did it for what I believe are spurious reasons, which is that it was in some way led to believe that the Northern Territory would be disadvantaged in some way by the Indigenous Land Corporation funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the case. In fact, the legislation was specifically written so that the Northern Territory would not be disadvantaged and would have its existing advantage over all the other states continue for another two years. If that board is sufficiently independent and if it knew all that information, I really welcome the board members communicating with me and telling me that that is what they knew when they made that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it made a decision that was not representative of the whole of Australia. It was a decision that very conveniently fell within the plans that were set out when the legislation was drafted. I doubt that it was a participant in that initial drafting agreement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans also made the point that there is no government influence over the board of ATSIC; that it is representative of all Aboriginals and had only three Northern Territory commissioners on it. That was another attempt to persuade us of the legitimacy of the decision, indicating that the commissioners were fully aware of the facts. The reality is&mdash;I am glad Senator Collins admitted this in his response to the motion&mdash;that the government appointed chairperson and deputy chair participated in the vote, which was tied, and the chairperson had the casting vote. So there was not universal support for the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, the evidence from the briefing document tabled to the commissioners gives the impression that there was a pre-arranged obligation to give special treatment to the Northern Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. It will probably be far better for my concentration as well because I could then finish the points on my list. It is indisputable that an inequitable decision was made by the ATSIC board. It is also indisputable that Senator Collins and Senator Gareth Evans, with some ambivalence, seem to be defending it and do not regard it as inequitable. I believe that the misleading and the misinformation has continued through this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Bill 1995 is an improved version of the Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Bill 1994. It irons out some technical problems in the 1994 version, and adds a requirement for treaty impact statements to improve the scrutiny process. I will also take this opportunity to foreshadow my proposal to create a Selection of Bills and Treaties Committee to streamline the reference of tabled treaties to legislation committees for inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fundamental democratic principle that an executive government should seek parliamentary approval before making a treaty binding upon Australia. Treaty making has historically been an executive prerogative, but the growth in the number and scope of international agreements has meant that the status quo can no longer be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Law-making in Australia has always been subject to the approval of a popularly elected representative assembly, namely the Federal Parliament. The fact that treaty making was considered separately was due to circumstances which applied then, but not today. In particular:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">treaties no longer only govern relations between states; they frequently have implications for the rights and obligations of citizens within states;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Britain no longer has ultimate responsibility for the conduct of our international affairs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is growing popular pressure for greater executive accountability, which has implications for the evolution of our system of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have all witnessed the annual treaties farce. Every year, a large swag of agreements is tabled in Parliament for a half-hour debate later in the day. Ratification is a fait accompli, and even implementing legislation is rare. To use a term which is gaining some currency, there is a `democratic deficit' associated with treaty-making in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the Democrats are not alone in believing this. There is a growing consensus that Parliament should be closely involved in the treaty-making process prior to signature and ratification. But there is still division over whether parliamentary approval should be required before a treaty can be made binding by the executive. That is the threshold issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I say there is division, however, I don't mean among the general public. In my experience, the average voter believes without question that Parliament should have the final say. It is among those who are closer to the action that resistance is greatest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide a focus for debate, and to put the Democrats' cards firmly on the table, I introduced the Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Bill 1994 in the middle of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a number of representations made to me as to how the Bill might be improved, I have introduced this 1995 version.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Bill 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Briefly, the Bill proposes that the Government be prevented from entering into a treaty, convention or protocol, or entering a reservation to a treaty, unless both Houses of Parliament give their approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process begins with a declaration in the Gazette that the Commonwealth proposes to enter into a treaty. The Government is then obliged, within fifteen sitting days, to table the treaty in each House for its approval, along with a treaty impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the Bill does not compel a debate and vote on every proposed agreement. If no member of a House gives notice of a debate within fifteen sitting days of tabling, that House is deemed to have given its approval. If notice is given, that House must give explicit approval by resolution. If notice is given in each House, each must pass a resolution of approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would operate alongside my proposal for a stream-lined process for referring proposed treaties to Senate committees for scrutiny. This would involve expanding the Selection of Bills Committee into a Selection of Bills and Treaties Committee. Any party wanting a treaty referred for inquiry would do so through this forum, and the committee to which the treaty was referred would go through the usual procedure of holding public hearings and reporting back to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not enamoured of proposals for a special Senate Treaties Committee, with the sole function of inquiring into treaties. The committee with the greatest relevant expertise should get the job&mdash;just as the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee was asked to look into the desertification convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutional concerns</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been some public comment doubting the constitutional validity of my Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My research tells me that the weight of legal opinion is that Parliament can be given, by legislation, the power to approve or disallow treaties. I doubt that Sir Anthony Mason would have endorsed a debate about such legislation unless it were constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were some genuine concerns expressed that my Bill did not properly distinguish the Parliament's power to approve treaties from the Executive's power to make them binding. This new version rectifies that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament's present role</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most common argument against parliamentary approval power is that Parliament already has its day in the sun, because legislation to implement a treaty must run the usual gauntlet of both Houses. This argument is false for several reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that, as far as treaty-making is concerned, Parliament spends most of its time in the shade. As Justice McHugh noted in his dissenting judgement on Teoh, only a small percentage of the treaties to which Australia is party is enacted into law. In some cases this is because the existing statutory framework already allows the treaty to be executed; in other cases the Government has put implementing legislation on the back-burner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even when a treaty does become the subject of legislation, it is often only part of the treaty which is implemented, and the legislation mostly deals with other unrelated matters. The implementation of parts of some ILO conventions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act is a case in point. Scrutiny of most of those conventions was impossible because of the size and complexity of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On top of all that, Parliament only gets to debate implementing legislation when the treaty in question is already binding at international law. That puts substantial pressure on us to pass the legislation so that Australia fulfils its international commitments. It is more subtle than having a gun held at your head, but the idea's the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are rare exceptions which show just how parliamentary approval could work. Prior to ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Government introduced the Chemical Weapons Convention Bill which was duly passed into law. There was a full debate on the merits of the Convention and its application to Australia, and the democratic process functioned as it should.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in almost every other case, parliamentary consideration of treaties is too little, too late. Parliament cannot scrutinise the executive's decision to make a treaty binding upon this country. In a small number of partial cases, Parliament merely gets to say whether the implementing legislation is adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why my Bill does not give Parliament two bites of the cherry. The difference between approving the treaty and passing implementing legislation is the difference between principle and detail. A very close analogy is the relationship between primary and delegated legislation: after passing primary legislation, Parliament also has the opportunity to disallow delegated legislation made under the principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Teoh case</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the recent debate about Parliament's role in treaty-making has been stimulated by the Teoh case. There is no doubt that Teoh has put a large dent in the argument that, because ratification of a treaty does not of itself change domestic or municipal law, legislation of the kind I have proposed isn't needed. The agreement in question was the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to quote from the lead judgement of then Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The fact that the Convention has not been incorporated into Australian law does not mean that its ratification holds no significance for Australian law. Where a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the courts should favour that construction which accords with Australia's obligations under a treaty or international convention to which Australia is a party . . . That is because Parliament, prima facie, intends to give effect to Australia's obligations under international law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is accepted that a statute is to be interpreted and applied, as far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity and not in conflict with the established rules of international law. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from influencing the construction of a statute or subordinate legislation, an international convention may play a part in the development by the courts of the common law. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ratification of a convention is positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention. That positive statement is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers will act in conformity with the Convention . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This argument was accepted by Justices Toohey and, as I read it, by Justice Gaudron even though she chose a different basis on which to argue her case. It was rejected only by Justice McHugh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And with the greatest respect to Justice McHugh, I did not find his arguments persuasive. He states that ratification of a treaty is not a statement to the national community, but only to the international community. This seems a rather artificial distinction, and makes me wonder why ratified treaties are tabled and debated in the Federal Parliament at all. And why bother consulting domestic interest groups and the States, as often happens?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two ways of responding to Teoh. The first is to recognise that as law making is increasingly internationalised, it should be subjected to detailed democratic review. The second is to legislate the Teoh effect out of existence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a typical display of unprincipled unity, the Government and the Opposition have decided to do the latter. The result will be regressive and possibly unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For one thing, it will create a widening gulf between our international posture and our domestic practice. What a gross embarrassment it would be that our public servants are allowed by law to ignore our international obligations, in some cases for years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also prevent our courts from filling the holes in our statutes by anchoring their judgements to international agreements which are binding upon us. That is simply absurd and creates a legal vacuum for no good reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what the Government and the Opposition are effectively saying in the case of Teoh is, public servants should be free to disregard the interests of children when considering whether to deport their father! That is utterly disgraceful. It is the antithesis of the internationalism we ought to practising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democratic deficit</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where I am in some agreement with Justice McHugh's dissenting judgement in Teoh is in his statement that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the result of ratifying an international convention was to give rise to a legitimate expectation that that convention would be applied in Australia, the Executive government of the Commonwealth would have effectively amended the law of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a strong element of truth in this, and it exposes the democratic deficit in the current treaty-making arrangements. It is a strong argument for ensuring that the ratification of treaties is preceded by parliamentary approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Sir Ninian Stephen used the term `democratic deficit' in a lecture last year, his concern was with treaties which transfer power from national to supranational bodies. I would add that there is a real deficit wherever rights and obligations are imposed on Australian citizens, under international law, without Parliament's consent. There is no popularly elected assembly which is empowered to approve, amend or reject the imposition of that obligation. That is a clear and unjustified democratic deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories, in their recent position paper entitled Reform of the Treaties Process, point out another aspect of democratic deficit in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commonwealth ratifies a treaty, relying on existing legislation to comply, there are substantial disincentives for future Parliaments to change the legislation. Effectively entrenching legislation in this way is a reality of modern international law. However, given the importance of parliamentary sovereignty, legislation should be entrenched by parliamentary rather than executive act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Third Lucinda Lecture earlier this year, Chief Justice Mason suggested that the growth in the scope of international affairs, and the advent of treaties which seek to "regulate conduct as between citizens within national boundaries", may not have been foreseen by the framers of the Constitution. In other words, the game has grown, but the rules have not changed. Sir Anthony went on to lend support to a debate about legislation for the parliamentary approval of treaties in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . [Whether any, and if so what, procedures should be prescribed for legislative authority or other consultation before the federal executive government commits Australia to an international convention which obliges the Australian Government to regulate conduct as between citizens within national boundaries, thus attracting the legislative power to carry that convention into effect, is a matter worthy of discussion. . . . Some have argued that the Federal Parliament must give its approval before the Federal Government can enter into a treaty. Others suggest that the State Governments and Parliaments must consent to such action as well. Of course, it does not follow that such steps, even if they should be thought to be desirable, should be incorporated in some constitutional provision. It may be that a procedure stipulated by statute would be sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would suggest that my Bill forms the basis of a statute of the kind Sir Anthony was referring to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative blockage?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been suggestions that parliamentary approval would be anti-democratic because it would give minor parties and independents in the Senate the power to block ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that's the case, then allowing the Senate to pass any legislation is anti-democratic. It is an argument against the Senate, not against parliamentary approval of treaties&mdash;an argument I'll gladly have with anyone, any time. I'll briefly rehearse the main points here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the composition of the Senate is more reflective of national voting intentions than is the House of Representatives, because it is elected by proportional representation. Sure, it would be more representative if elected from multi-member electorates of equal size, instead of from the States. But it would not change the balance of numbers to any significant degree. Even then, neither major party would be in control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the minor parties can't block anything without the support of a major party. That is the arithmetic of majority voting. And contrary to popular belief, Oppositions don't routinely oppose government legislation. Like us, they make their decisions case by case. So if the Senate were ever to refuse to approve a treaty, it would be because a majority of senators made a considered decision to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, the Senate is much more representative and democratic than Cabinet. It has open debates and public votes, and allows people representing most Australians the chance to have their say, rather than just a few representatives from the ruling party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not well understood in the wider public that the Senate rarely defeats legislation. It frequently amends it, and often with the tacit gratitude of the Government. But passage is frequently occurs with the Opposition voting with the Government. When it doesn't, the Government is usually able to negotiate a constructive compromise with ourselves and the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main result of parliamentary approval will be, simply, better scrutiny and a better decision about the treaty. One consequence of the Bill is that, where a proposed treaty is significant or controversial, the Government is likely to seek early input from the Parliament. It will probably table drafts of the treaty, which could be examined by a committee through submissions and public hearings. The Government would have to do more domestic leg-work to build political support, and would have to respond to valid and widespread concerns by modifying its negotiating position. Domestic interest groups would have a greater say in shaping Australia's stance because of the leverage available to them through non-government parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major impact of parliamentary approval would be at this formative stage. It would encourage a more open, informed and thorough consideration before the treaty, and the official Australian position on it, were finalised It would create a greater domestic understanding of our international obligations. Contrary to the view that it would give troglodytes an opportunity to block progressive measures, the responsibility vested in them would force a more sophisticated and balanced response. It would bind us more closely to the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International comparisons</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have note done a comprehensive survey of other countries' treaty-making procedures, and would defer to the Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet's discussion paper on treaty reform. The examples quoted show that Australia would be far from alone in requiring parliamentary approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best-known example of this is the US Constitution, which requires the President to obtain the approval of two-thirds of Senators before making treaties. US courts have defined a treaty for the purposes of the Constitution more narrowly than the international definition, but the power of the Senate is nevertheless impressive. For example, arms control agreements, which lie at the heart of national security concerns, are subject to Senate approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been claimed that the requirement of Senate approval has made the United States insular, by allowing uninformed populism to constrain the exercise of the treaty-making power. This does not appear to be borne out by the statistics. Our own Foreign Minister reports that the US is party to over 7,000 treaties, compared to Australia's 920.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case, this Bill does not impose a requirement for a two-thirds majority, merely a simple majority. That is a significantly lower hurdle to jump. All in all, the US experience is further evidence against the blockage argument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Views of the States and Territories</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their position paper, Reform of the Treaties Process, the States and Territories propose that either House of Parliament be able to prevent ratification. This proposal is entirely consistent with my Bill, and the Democrats will seek further detailed discussions with the States and Territories on this in the near future. We have already adopted their proposals for treaty impact statements to be tabled as part of the approval process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In think the States have come a long way in proposing constructive reforms rather than simply bemoaning the erosion of State's rights through the external affairs power. The Democrats are not opposed in principle to the use of the external affairs power to over-ride State laws, but we strongly believe it should be subject to parliamentary review. That is now common ground with the States and Territories, and it shows that the Government and Opposition are increasingly isolated in their hostility to the concept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was depressed by media reports of the communique from the recent Constitutional Centenary Foundation conference, Australian Governance in a Global Society. The impression I got was that the conference unanimously agreed to oppose parliamentary approval of treaties. But the actual text acknowledges that "some participants felt that parliamentary approval should be obtained prior to ratification". It always pays to check the primary source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I can't deny that most of the participants believed that ratification should remain an executive prerogative. The compromise reached was to call for greater parliamentary scrutiny prior to ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That might seem like a reasonable half-way measure, but it isn't. It's more like a tenth-way measure. In politics, the numbers rule, and consultation without the ultimate power of veto is generally only a formality. Nothing forces a government to justify its position more than the prospect that it may be knocked back. Believe me, I've seen it so often.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a parliamentarian, internationalist and small-`d' democrat, I have no doubt that we cannot confine Australia's role in international law-making to the secrecy of the Cabinet room. My long experience tells me that open debate leads to better decisions by governments, and a greater public understanding of the consequences. With the centre of gravity of our law-making increasingly shifting off-shore, there is no popularly-elected forum which has the power and responsibility to act in the interests of our citizens. I, and the Democrats, believe It is time that changed.</PARA>

<PARA>RAAF air crashes are always sad events and are not to be treated lightly. In the brief time I have to refer tonight to the summary of investigation, I want to draw to the Senate's attention a few points about a crash which fortunately did not result in deaths of our airmen. On 24 October 1994, three Macchi aircraft took off from RAAF base Williamtown for an exercise. Shortly after, two of the aircraft collided. Following the air collision, both aircraft entered uncontrollable rapid and accelerating rolls to the left. Both pilots landed by parachute in heavily timbered country. Both pilots suffered minor injury caused by ejection from the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An accident investigation team was formed, and subsequently a board of inquiry continued with the investigation. The cause of the investigation was determined to be the failure of the pilot of the lead aircraft to maintain collision avoidance. It was determined that the pilot had not acted wilfully but that his action was an error of judgment and no disciplinary action was warranted against any person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, a number factors contributed to this accident which all senators should be concerned about. First of all, it was determined that there was a low level of pilot experience and currency of junior aircrew in air combat manoeuvring&mdash;the exercise in which these pilots were involved. It is not just a question of lack of experience in junior aircrew; it is a problem of loss of pilots from the air force. Although we will inevitably always have a lack of pilot experience in younger pilots, we will have increasing proportions as experienced pilots leave the air force. It is something which should be exercising the minds of the government much more urgently than it appears to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Serving in the Australian Defence Force can be a dangerous occupation. Training for conflict cannot afford accidents. But we want to do everything we possibly can to make sure that our Defence Force is as experienced as we can possible make it. In this case, one of the other findings was that the ACM&mdash;air combat manoeuvring&mdash;practice was restricted because they were trying to manage the Macchi fatigue life. ACM is one of the highest sortie profiles for causing high damage. In other words, one of the manoeuvres most likely to be needed for training for conflict was restricted for these pilots because our Macchi trainers are getting old. We have had them for 27 or 28 years, and we have lost about 27 of them over 27 years. If we are going to keep them going until the year 2000, which is about the date that the government intends to replace them, we have to restrict the amount of training and the type of training done in these aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about `just in time' being a philosophy for stock holding in industry. Economically rational that may well be, but `just in time' is a pretty dangerous way to be playing with the lives of our servicemen. If these aircraft are being retained in a state where excessive activity or the sort of activity they would need to undergo in conflict will cause fatigue and cracking resulting in danger and the possibility of death to our servicemen, we should be walking away from the `just in time' concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not enough focus on the need to preserve pilots' lives at the same time as trying to extend the lives of the aircraft. These efforts can be costly in terms of life and limb, and aircraft.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third factor that I want to draw attention to is that there was less than optimum supervision of operational training. The RAAF has said that measures to improve flying supervision are being put in place and that the rules of combat have been reviewed and amended to state clearly the priority of safety rules over tactical considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are worried about the fatigue of aircraft, it may end up that safety rules are taking such priority over tactical considerations that our pilots will simply not be getting the training they need. There is an urgent need to get the lead-in fighter replacement earlier than is scheduled by the government. I argue strongly that the government should be putting more priority on this procurement. </PARA>

While we might all have views about the degree of independence of our universities, and the influence wielded by funding bodies and those who provide research grants, we would be dismayed if academics could be so easily removed here because they choose to engage society and government in critical dialogue about the fundamentals of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Aditjondro has also had first-hand experience of the so-called rights of Indonesian citizens. He has been interrogated by the police and military in his home city and has been written up in the local papers for his pro-democracy activism. In fact, the police in Salitiga have been quoted in the paper saying that they will send Interpol to Australia to drag him back. The papers have also said that Dr Aditjondro has applied for political asylum in Australia. As neither of those claims stands up to any scrutiny, we can only assume that such press stories are part of an attempt by the police and military in Indonesia to put pressure on Dr Aditjondro in an attempt to silence him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first claim about Interpol is laughable, as honourable senators would surely know, as Interpol is not a police force and does not move around the world picking people up to take them home. Secondly, Dr Aditjondro has made no application for asylum of any kind in Australia. I add at this point my thanks to the staff of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Perth for their friendly and expert assistance with Dr Aditjondro's visa renewal, which has enabled him to take up an offer to teach a course in Indonesian environmental studies next semester at Murdoch University. The course is made all the more relevant by the visit to Australia last week of Indonesian research and technology minister Habibie who, I am sure, has been here to further discuss nuclear technology cooperation between our government and his.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Dr Aditjondro, while he is at Murdoch, will add a powerful voice against the nuclear power plans of the Indonesian government. Those plans are one of the most appalling aspects of the close relationship which exists between the two countries. It is beyond me that the Australian government can contemplate, much less encourage, the development of such dangerous, expensive and discredited means of power generation in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this sort of cooperation goes to the heart of Dr Aditjondro's concerns. In keeping with his role as an academic, he begins with questions: why does Indonesia refuse to recognise people's human rights? Is it because the government is afraid of the consequences of freedom? What would be lost by the government if the people were free? What would be lost by government officials if the press was free? What are they afraid might be disclosed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He asks questions also about Australia: why has Australia deserted the people of East Timor? Why does this country, which talks so much about human rights, turn a blind eye to the abuses carried out by the Indonesian military in East Timor? Why does Australia have such close cooperation with the Indonesian military? Why would the Australian government be prepared to sell thousands of rifles to a military which has massacred hundreds of thousands of people in East Timor?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The papers in Indonesia have also said that that government will seek to have Dr Aditjondro extradited so he can stand trial. So we could check out this claim, I made sure my office got a copy of the Australia-Indonesia extradition treaty which came into force earlier this year. Interestingly, the treaty says amongst other things that extradition will not be granted for political offences. We should be very grateful for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether other senators share my view that a charge of `insulting a government body' constitutes a political offence? Do they share my view that far from being an offence in this country&mdash;another obstacle standing in the way of moves to extradite Dr Aditjondro is that the offence has to be so recognised in both countries&mdash;insulting the government or its various agencies is something of a national pastime and insulting members of parliament is the stock-in-trade of far too many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while these press reports in Indonesia&mdash;we must remember that the press is government controlled&mdash;have little substance, it would clearly be unwise for Dr Aditjondro to go home at present. Dr Aditjondro does not have the international profile of a Zakharov or a Solzhenitsyn, but the parallels are there&mdash;although I suspect he would be embarrassed to hear me say so. Here is a man who passionately loves his country, enough to be ostracised because he loves enough to criticise. Like those more celebrated dissidents, he is saddened that his country is failing its citizens and is willing to put aside their rights in pursuit of lesser goals than freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, Dr Aditjondro is passionate about Indonesia's potential as a nation, harnessing the willing participation of its enormous human resources. His passion has, at least for the time being, cost him his job and the ability to live where he wants to live. That same passion is set alongside his hope for a better future for the country he loves. There is, in all this, a consolation for me; that is, the privilege of getting to know Dr George Aditjondro and the hope that the Australian government may make the most of the opportunity presented by his work in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to take a few moments of this adjournment debate to speak about what I call the forgotten peacekeepers. Seldom do the Australian Federal Police get any recognition, least of all in this parliament. Tonight I wish to remind the Senate of what I believe is an obligation of this parliament to look after these people, the forgotten peacekeepers. In fact, when these people were at the front line&mdash;and I emphasise the front line&mdash;my colleague Senator Newman was the first person up there from this parliament to actually meet with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Australian Federal Police&mdash;approximately 100&mdash;as we know have been participants in UN and international peacekeeping activities in Cambodia, Mozambique and Haiti. In all cases members have lived and worked in particularly hazardous, difficult and uncomfortable environments. The work performed has been to assist in the maintenance of law and order, facilitate the demobilisation of armed forces, train local police, assist in the development of a system of law and order and ensure that individual civil rights are protected and respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contingents were required to perform policing functions in isolated environments, which included minimal medical facilities, limited logistical and communications support, in some cases the presence of uncharted minefields, together with armed civilians and demobilised military elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, as a result of the intervention of the then Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, with the Treasurer and Prime Minister, members who served in Cambodia were granted a tax exemption under section 23AC of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This provision provides for ADF and other personnel serving in an operational area to be exempted from income tax. The basis of this exemption was the hazardous and warlike nature of the environment and activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite repeated requests to the AFP and commitments from the AFP that it would pursue the issue of tax exemption for AFP members in Haiti and Mozambique, at this stage it appears that the best that the AFP has done has been to seek eligibility for payment of a rebate under section 23AB. This is nowhere near the benefit that an exemption would provide. This section provides for a rebate of approximately $330. This provision fails to recognise the true nature of the work performed and the conditions experienced by the Australian Federal Police members. It is essentially in recognition of isolated uncongenial living conditions and is currently applicable to AFP members serving in Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act dealing with service overseas and income earned overseas, namely, section 23AG and approved overseas projects, section 23AF, provide for tax exemption to be granted. It appears that whilst Australia receives a substantial benefit and increased international status and recognition from the way in which the various AFP contingents sent overseas carry out their functions, the government is not prepared to recognise the effort and service of the individuals from the point of view of proper income tax recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible, I remind the Senate, for individuals working for organisations such as Telstra, overseas aid and development agencies on building projects, assisting with the management of public administration, the development of agriculture, building sewerage works et cetera, to be treated as tax exempt whilst overseas. The best that has been proposed for the Australian Federal Police members who served with distinction in such hazardous conditions as Haiti and Mozambique, is a miserable rebate of $330&mdash;and that has not even yet come through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Haiti contingent is concerned, there is even doubt that this rebate will be provided as they were not part of a UN contingent, but rather were part of a multinational force organised by the US. Some six months have now elapsed after the return of the Mozambique contingent and the police association and its members are still seeking to have the Australian Federal Police finalise a review of the terms and conditions of the contingents and resolve the taxation situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give credit to Senator Robert Ray and the officers within the defence corps because they do attempt to get pretty speedily, as far as Defence Force members are concerned, proper recognition when they are in such hazardous areas. However, I cannot say the same is true for those who look after the men and women in the Australian Federal Police. They are getting shabby treatment and I therefore call on the minister and the head of the Australian Federal Police to meet urgently with the government and the Treasury to ensure appropriate recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several avenues can be approached. For example, it is even possible to use section 23AF(18) but, of course, in those situations one must get an approved project&mdash;that is, a project in respect of which an approval is granted under subsection (11). Such approval, however, requires government action, because under that provision it is possible that the Australian Federal Police could come under subsection (e) whereby it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a project consisting of giving advice or assistance relating to the management or administration of a government department or of a public utility;</PARA>
<PARA>The government could pursue a number of avenues to grant justice. I believe that it is up to the government to expedite this matter, look at the alternatives and grant tax justice to people who have served Australia well and put their lives at risk in the course of their duty. This parliament has to protect these people and I look forward to a response from the minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 May this year, Andre Cirulis passed away. I want to put on record what a great public servant he was. In 1978 he became Deputy Chief Electoral Officer for Australia and the main task he was allocated by the then Fraser government was rewriting the Electoral Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a change of government in 1983, this parliament set up the Joint Select Committee into Electoral Reform to review the Electoral Act and recommend changes. It was quite a colourful committee chaired by the irascible Dick Klugman and had on it myself, Senator Richardson, John Scott, Sir John Carrick&mdash;one of the greats of the Liberal Party&mdash;Steele Hall, the wiley Ralph Hunt and the very intellectual Michael Macklin. I think it is true to say that, by parliamentary standards, it was not a bad quality committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It entered into an era of massive activity. It was set up in May, made its full report in August and saw its report translated into final legislation by November that year. Andre Cirulis played the key role in advice to the committee. His advice was always independent and was always presented fearlessly. He was never intimidated by such an intimidating committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He generated scores of research papers, provided expert legal advice and was an absolute whiz at computer systems. He had an enduring belief that there must be full probity in the electoral process. It was one of the few instances I can remember where someone was invited to all private meetings of the committee as well as the public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His contribution to electoral reform and fairness has probably never been recognised in Australia. I often pondered on the irony of his position. He was so irreplaceable as the Deputy Electoral Commissioner I do not think he was ever offered the job he deserved of Chief Electoral Commissioner because no-one could find a replacement for him and the work that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that through recent years after leaving the Public Service he suffered a fair degree of illness. But I for one will never forget his contribution to public life, made fairly without fear or favour of any political party to the reform process in the electoral area in this country. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my condolences to his wife Lynn, his family and all his friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this year, `Australia Remembers', 50 years after the end of World War II, let us pause and ask ourselves what are our essential responsibilities and goals in holding these commemorative functions. First, our duty is to the post-war generations to inform them as factually as possible of the causes of the war, the failures to read the danger signs of rising totalitarianism or to intervene in time to prevent global conflict; to stress, too, the vulnerability and fragility of democracy, its tendency to complacency and general unwillingness to sustain a high level of defensive armament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in projecting the unprecedented magnitude of the slaughter, atrocities, holocaust and suffering on all sides of the conflict, to pay full tribute to all who served and to the thousands of anonymous acts of heroism and self-sacrifice. It must be remembered always that it is not the generals, admirals and air marshals but the common men and women who bear the real burden of war. As Kipling so aptly expressed his tribute:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were together since the war began</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was my servant and the better man</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, and most importantly, in the full knowledge of the price paid in the resistance of aggression, to ask ourselves how much safer from insensate slaughter is our post-war world. Has totalitarianism been diminished? Are people freer, healthier and less impoverished? Certainly, and in due tribute to Britain's virtually lone stand against the Axis Powers in 1940, a large part of the world remains free from the tyranny of dictatorship. But have we used the full measure of that immense sacrifice and its resultant victory to create an effective world order? That is surely the key question for this anniversary year and for every year ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions following World War I, the war to end all wars, offer little useful guidance or consolation. The Treaty of Versailles, the economic sanctions, the creation of the buffer states, the dismantling of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the formation of a heterogeneous nation such as Yugoslavia, the unsupervised disarmament treaties flagrantly violated by Germany and Japan, the creation of the League of Nations as the centrepiece for world order and international cooperation&mdash;in the examination by hindsight of each of these, there are many pointers to mistakes, and warnings, too, of the penalties of apathy, lack of vigilance and defence neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the start, the League of Nations was doomed to failure. Its chief founder, US President Woodrow Wilson, could not persuade his own country to join. The League was a virtual bystander during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and China, the Italian onslaught on Ethiopia and the German Anschluss of Austria.The message from all of this was very clear: unless disarmament treaties were very effectively policed and enforced, and unless a competent world body with authority and defensive capacity or a group of powerful democratic nations working together were willing to intervene to arrest aggression in its early and controllable stages, a future world conflict was inevitable. The message was there but the collective will and capacity to act were missing and the price of this avoidable war was in excess of 40 million lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what about the new attempt at world order which emerged in the form of the United Nations after World War II? This is no matter for snap or emotional judgment, whether by way of assessment of the work and achievements of the Security Council, the Assembly or the various UN agencies. It requires an objective, in-depth review both at global and national levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, it might well merit a natural reference to the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade as a first step in stimulating widespread academic, defence and community debate, culminating in a major review by both houses of this legislature. There could be no more tangible or valuable contribution to the theme `Australia Remembers'. Unless we seriously reflect upon our international and national strengths and weaknesses in the goal of peace through collective security, we are in danger of repeating the failures of the 1930s. Most importantly, we have a duty to new generations to expose to them the challenges which they must confront. I commend to the Senate this concept of a serious review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major experiment at collective security has achieved conspicuous success. I refer to the European Community and its defence evolution, NATO. It is well to recall that the concept of the so-called `Common Market' grew out of the visions and wisdom of Churchill and Schumann, finding expression in the Treaty of Rome, essentially a defence rather than an economic undertaking. The two main architects, conscious of the almost continuous warfare between the nations of Western Europe over the centuries, argued that if the nations were to become economically interdependent, each producing those goods and services which they did best rather than seeking individual self-sustenance, not only would they be incapable of waging wars against each other but, more importantly, they would become a uniquely powerful grouping for collective security, as well as a thriving economic bloc. And that vision has been realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That grouping has evolved into a defensive arm in the form of NATO, reinforced by the USA. Its four million strong defence force, although scattered over various land masses, has proved a very strong resistance throughout the long Cold War years, to the six million troops of the Warsaw Pact, assembled on a small area, with the advantage of consolidation, rapid movement and surprise. The Warsaw members, of course, were conscious of the retaliative capacity of the US naval forces, especially the nuclear submarines spread throughout the world's oceans, difficult to detect and carrying 60 per cent of America's long-range missile weaponry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now NATO, along with the UN, urgently requires thoughtful study as to its future, both in membership and in strategy. With the collapse of the USSR and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the freeing of a number of Central and Eastern European states from communist bonding and the fragmentation of the former groupings such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, the former central focus of NATO's defensive role has gone and its future role remains, temporarily at least, obscure. Add to this the decision of a number of Central European states to join NATO and the significant difficulties that this currently produces, as viewed by Russia, and a major and sober rethink is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How should we view Russia in the years immediately ahead? Today, it is a country which is very similar in its massive problems to Germany after World War I. It has lost its significant buffer states, its economy is in depression, its national pride and morale are at a low ebb. It is a country which is vulnerable to leadership capture by another Hitler type ideologue or demagogue. It is a country, most imperatively, that has been vulnerable and subject to invasion over 700 years of history; a country, one remembers, in which virtually every house and family has a scar from the number of relatives slain during Hitler's murderous eastern front offensive. Against that background, having lost 30 million dead in wars and revolutions over the last 70 years, its grave suspicions of a united Germany are at least understandable. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And here is the real dilemma: we must not, however unwittingly, create unnecessary confrontation or enmities. But we must, if global conflict is to be prevented, maintain effective collective security as a genuine, enforceable deterrent against aggression. These are the vital questions which not only those who are alive should remember but, far more importantly, upon which the new and future generations must be induced to ponder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at post-war positives, credit should be given to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Some comfort, too, may be taken from the progress of nuclear disarmament, with the Ukraine receiving topical focus. But the stockpiles are so large and the accuracy and range of modern delivery systems so good, that the measurement of achievement by quantum alone is illusory. The whole question of the so-called `theatre nuclear weapons', the small weapons devoted to limited territory, presumably as an adjunct to conventional war, requires major thought. Surely, it is quite unreasonable to argue that once limited nuclear weapons are deployed and used, there will not be a full-scale escalation into global lunacy and destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear weapons have been deployed twice, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing 200,000 people. Those demonstrations of killing and maiming are a frightening warning against the further use of such weapons. Since World War II, more than 20 million people have been killed in wars using conventional weapons and millions more have been maimed and destroyed. That killing and destruction go on today in escalating numbers in Somalia, Bosnia, Croatia, Rwanda, Cambodia and the Middle East&mdash;in hundreds of conflicts throughout the earth's surface, all of them using conventional weapons. Eighty-five per cent of all military expenditure on weaponry is directed to conventional weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proliferation of weaponry goes on, with the United Nations seemingly incapable of preventing or arresting wars and with no visible evidence of any attempt to limit the manufacture and sale of those instruments of mass murder, be they legal or illegal. The United Nations is so thin on the ground and so lacking in readily available collective security forces; it seems so weak, even impotent, in its limited role of so-called peacekeeping and medical and sustenance support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nations of the world, until now, have been understandably preoccupied with the limitation of arms in the nuclear field. Little or no practical action, or indeed debate, has been directed towards the limitation of the proliferation of conventional weapons of mass destruction. Why should there not be a conventional arms non-proliferation treaty of some sort? So many of the weapons currently used are seemingly incapable of indigenous production in their particular theatre. Some, like the surface-to-air missiles in the early Rwanda outbreak, are quite sophisticated. Is it too naive to believe that there could be a significant disclosure and reduction of conventional weapons and a major international policing of illegal arms traffic? After all, with the new long-range accurate delivery systems designed for nuclear warheads, conventional weapons of mass destruction can now be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The collapse of the Warsaw Pact is no ground for complacency. New generations must be encouraged to examine with thoroughness every new hot-point. I urge the widening of discussion on world issues and a major education of the new generations of their challenges. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise tonight the impediment being placed by the Taxation Office upon innovative and excellence in education, especially through computers being integrated into the curriculum of many pathfinder schools. We all know that computers are very important for every Australian, especially for those young Australians whose lives will involve the use of computers through their working years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, a number of schools not only have computers in particular classrooms that are used from time to time by students but encourage students to have a computer at home so as to become familiar with computing and word processing. Some schools have taken the curriculum decision that every student throughout, say, year 8 will need to have a portable computer at class during the day, to take home for homework at night and then to take into year 9, year 10, year 11 and year 12. This means that they will have a personal computer with them in the way that many of us had pens, pencils, rulers and textbooks in that stage of secondary schooling or even primary schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until this point, the sales tax law has allowed a school to purchase computers for such a group of students, for the students to then lease them from the school and for that original purchase, so long as the school actually owns the computers, to be free of sales tax. The kind of computer involved in this curriculum innovation for at least a dozen schools&mdash;and a growing number of schools&mdash;has a cost in the order of $3,250. A 21 per cent sales tax on that is over $500. I want to alert the Senate that this $500 sales tax is now threatened to be placed upon computers by the Taxation Office without reference to any change in the sales tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to put to the Treasurer, Mr Willis, to Mr Beazley, to Mr Gear, to the education ministers Mr Crean and Mr Free, and, indeed, to all of the decision-making parts of the government that relate to this matter that the draft tax ruling on sales tax that appears to be ready to withdraw the concession that has existed in all the years up till now should not ever be implemented. Rather than the draft sales tax ruling being confirmed, it should be rejected and the status quo retained. Page 80,626 of the sales tax rulings states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exemption may also be claimed on goods purchased by universities or schools for use as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;for hire to students or teachers of the university or school, provided that the university or school always owns the goods.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the ruling in October 1992 and that is the status quo. That is what I wish the case to be with regard to sales tax on computers used in schools. A draft ruling from the Tax Office on 2 November 1994 contradicts this, despite there being no change to the legislation. Page 4 of an alert entitled, `Draft bulletin: sales tax and universities and schools&mdash;bulletin No. 8' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are there any goods that a university or school can't buy free of sales tax?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exemption will not apply if goods are bought by a university or school for the purpose of resale, or for lease or hire.</PARA>
<PARA>As an example it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;distributed to students or teachers in return for a charge, fee or levy where the ownership of the goods passes from the school to the student or teacher . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to this question of where the ownership passes, my view is that the ownership in these schemes always remains with the school. But these words are now being seen as a huge threat to a major investment involving hundreds of thousands of dollars in the resources of schools, parents and students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make three particular observations. Firstly, if the sales tax section of the tax office believes that this could be a rort whereby a student gaining a sales tax free computer gives it to a parent to use for a business purpose, the sales tax saved would be about $500. But if it is used for a business purpose, the parent could write off the cost of the computer over three years at a third each year and thus save in company tax or personal income tax a greater amount than that saved by the sales tax I am speaking about. It is therefore not a rort. In fact, these students are required to have full use of the computer as a matter of curriculum for every class, for every day of the year and for every evening in homework. Mum and dad will not get a look in. I do not believe that this is a rort in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is not being elitist to allow this kind of sales tax concession to a dozen pathfinder schools. All curriculum innovation has been introduced by a small number of schools. That is not to be elitist; it is to be a pathfinder of excellence. I believe there will be an increasing use of computers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is a direct education cost to the schools and to the students and their parents in the same way as pens, pencils and paper. It is iniquitous for the Australian government to be putting a burden on education in this unprecedented way. I therefore put on notice that there are a number of schools in my state of South Australia which approached me about this. There are schools in Queensland, Victoria and other states that are introducing personal computers that are carried day by day from home to school by every student throughout a whole year of school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that last Friday this problem was on the agenda of a meeting of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. I want to add my voice to those ministers in the council who were putting the view that this draft tax ruling with regard to sales tax should not be confirmed but rather have the status quo retained so that we do not have a huge embarrassment to those excellent schools that have taken this innovative step in the way in which they go about education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that some schools have already invested heavily and have required parents to pay leasing for the large number of computers that are owned by the school. If there were to be this sales tax, an unexpected $500 and more tax would have to be met by parents either by way of an extra levy or by paying increased fees. This would be a case of false pretences and I believe we should not drive schools and parents into this kind of dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note that a Macintosh powerbook 520 costs $3,249 if tax is included. The tax is $564 in that example. There may well be a lower final cost if there is a large purchase. But when we start multiplying that by 125 computers, we are talking about $400,000 worth of investment into a very good curriculum innovation of great benefit to the education of Australian children and future generations. I ask the government not to confirm this draft tax ruling. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised that the National Police Research Unit (NPRU) is conducting research into oleoresin capsicum spray as part of its research into less-than-lethal weapons in general. It has not conducted trials or tests, but has monitored operational tests carried out in New South Wales and Victoria. The research project is still in progress and, therefore, no results have been published to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is not appropriate for me to comment on, nor am I aware of, the intentions of State and Northern Territory police jurisdictions. I am advised by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) that capsicum spray is not currently issued to its members. Any decision on its use by the AFP in future would have regard, among other things, to the NPRU's research findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP has also advised that private possession of organic sprays was discussed at the 1995 Australasia and South West Pacific Region Police Commissioners Conference in Fiji. The Conference, recognising the potential for such items to become weapons for criminals, resolved, inter alia, to strongly oppose the introduction of legislation to legalise the possession, manufacture and importation of disabling sprays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am advised that the NPRU is aware that deaths have been attributed to capsicum spray in the United States of America (USA) and that relevant reports are being studied as part of its research project. It further advises that the Association of Chiefs of Police (USA) which sponsored research into the deaths has reported that this research revealed no causal link between the deaths and capsicum spray used by police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The NPRU advises that `non-lethal' in this context is not intended to imply 100% assurance that weapons within this category will not cause death, but that the likelihood of death and injury to suspects, innocent bystanders and police is substantially minimised if they are used instead of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The NPRU advises that it is not aware of any relevant material published by the National Health and Medical Research Council, however, it is currently liaising with a specialist in respiratory diseases at the Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide. There is clear understanding that if capsicum sprays were adopted for police use in Australia there would need to be clearly enunciated and understood after-care procedures in place for people affected by the spray, whether they be suspects, bystanders or police.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, I am aware of the report by Thomas Ginsberg of the Australian Associated Press on 7 February entitled `Researcher Counts Kiddie-Porn Flurry on Internet'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes, the report mentions that during a 7-day period in late December 1994, a researcher at the Stockholm University's Institute of Computer and Systems Science, Mr Mats Wiklund counted 5,651 messages or postings about child pornography in four "bulletin boards".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes, the report states that among the postings, about 800 were graphic pictures of adolescents engaged in sexual acts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes, computer based communications networks such as Internet and overseas bulletin boards can be accessed from Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Interdepartmental Bulletin Board Task Force has been set up by the Government to develop options for the regulation of the content of material disseminated by means of computers through telecommunications networks. At the February 1995 meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the recommendations of this Task Force were considered and in principle support was given to the development of a self-regulatory scheme for the information and telecommunications industry which would include a complaints mechanism. State and Territory Ministers also gave an in principle commitment to developing legislation which defines offences for misuse of Bulletin Boards. I note that while the Task Force acknowledged that there were practical limits to regulation in this area, it did consider that the main principles of Australia's censorship system can be applied successfully to computer-based means of communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I am advised that inquiries by Australian police services have shown that computers have been used by some Australians to obtain child pornography. A person who sought to obtain child pornography from overseas by means of a computer has recently been convicted in Western Australia. Another person has been charged with procuring the supply of child pornography via computer and proceedings are underway. Both instances apply to Bulletin Board System access, rather than Internet, per se.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that all States and Territories have laws prohibiting the possession or distribution of child pornography.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) The East Timor case in the International Court commenced in February 1991. It is not possible, using reasonable resources, to provide a complete costing for the case. Until the settlement of the Nauru case in August 1993 many of the expenses incurred in relation to the case were incurred as part of meetings that dealt with both cases. This economy was possible as Australia used the same overseas counsel in the Timor case as in the Nauru case, with one addition. A division of costs for this period has been made to reflect the proportion of time spent on the Timor case. I am informed that, allowing for such adjustments, it is possible to provide a reasonably accurate breakdown of costs, other than salary costs. The major categories of expenditure are outside counsel's fees, travel and accommodation involved in conferences to plan and settle argument and pleadings, the cost of the accommodation and office support for the three week hearing in the Hague in January-February 1995, and incidentals covering primarily printing of the two written pleadings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the extensive use made of in house counsel including the Solicitor-General and the Head of the Office of International Law, whose salary costs were met from normal budget allocations, contributed to a significant reduction in the costs that would otherwise have been incurred. In addition, considerable time was spent in preparation on the case by other government officials. This has involved the time of officers from the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is not possible to place a financial figure on the considerable salary costs representing time of in house counsel and officers devoted to the case. The time was, however, significant.</PARA>
