<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After question time yesterday, some senators questioned the statement by the Acting Deputy President, Senator Colston, that the procedures for taking note of answers apply to any answer given on a day regardless of when the question was asked. This statement was correct. When the sessional order relating to motions to take note of answers was adopted on 16 September 1992, the wording of the sessional order was changed with the explicit intention of making it clear that it applies to any answers given on the day concerned regardless of when the question was asked. Reference to it is at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>pages 974 to 975. I also reiterated this principle in a statement to the Senate on 1 March 1994, which appears at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>on page 1163.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This private member's bill, the Public Service (Abolition of Compulsory Retirement Age) Amendment Bill 1995 is a bill to abolish compulsory retirement in the Australian Public Service. It will allow the recruitment of officers by the Commonwealth after the age of 65 and it will allow people who are employed by the Commonwealth to work beyond the current retirement age of 65 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill covers Commonwealth Employment and the Australian Public Service only. It does not transcend state rights but complements current state legislation relating to age discrimination and/or compulsory retirement. The act will take effect on the day it receives Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the first time I have introduced a Private Senators bill to remove compulsory age retirement in the public service. In 1992 I introduced a similar bill which lapsed when the 1993 election was called. Since 1990 the Coalition has consistently amended Government legislation to prevent Government appointments from automatically expiring at age 65.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During that time the Government has obfuscated, delayed and uttered a few platitudes but done nothing. In 1990 the Minister for Social Security, in a media release dated 13 September, gave an undertaking to remove age discrimination from all existing federal legislation. Nothing has been done in the five years since then except that an inquiry has been instigated&mdash;a Task Force chaired by the Attorney General's Department, which is examining the issue and was originally to report in Autumn 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apparently the Task Force is now due to report shortly but how many times have we heard that. Meanwhile nothing is done to abolish discrimination on the basis of age in the Commonwealth Public Service and there is no evidence of the Government's commitment to moving to end compulsory age retirement in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no clearly articulated policy reasons for the retention of compulsory age retirement in the APS and more importantly treating public servants less favourably than private sector employees. The fact is the Commonwealth has direct power to amend the Public Service Act in relation to compulsory age retirement without relying on the external affairs power..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this and the overwhelming arguments against compulsory age retirement, the Government has continued to discriminate against its own employees in relation to this issue. Moreover, the Commonwealth has been able to take advantage of its own unique status as an employer to avoid the very anti-discrimination laws it has foisted upon other employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government inactivity further defies explanation given that the effect upon Commonwealth finances is likely to be negligible. Only a relatively small number of Commonwealth public servants are likely to be affected by the removal of compulsory age retirement. Only 2.2 per cent of permanent Commonwealth public servants are aged 60 and over, and in the year ending June 1994, there were 974 age retirements from the APS that is only 11 per cent of total separations. Of these age retirements, only 249 were amongst permanent staff aged 64 or over. As at 30 June 1994, there were 81 permanent public servants aged 65. (Source: Dept. of Finance, Australian Public Service Statistical Bulletin 1993-94, pp59 and 103)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, The Public Service act imposes a mandatory retiring age of 65 with a limited (and not widely known) provision for staff beyond 65 to be able to continue working at the secretary's discretion (s.76V for non-SES staff and s.76J for SES staff plus s.76C). The act also provides for an option to retire at an earlier age. Finally, the existing act provides a bar to certain appointments of persons over 65 years of age or for a period extending beyond that age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Public Service Act in this bill will cover the major areas of public sector employment, including amendments to the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, amendments to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act and amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act. However, by necessity, there are some exemptions. The Judiciary, following an amendment to the Constitution in 1977, retire on reaching age 70. The armed forces and the police force will also be exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arguments in support of abolishing retirement age are overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For most people in our society, their identity, status and self-esteem derive almost entirely from their jobs, but as the population ages and life expectancy increases, people will spend a much longer period of time outside the paid workforce in retirement. Compulsory retirement for an increasing number of the active aged has meant exclusion from the workforce, lower incomes and the implication that the person has less to contribute than earlier in life. Because it is fixed at a particular age, it makes no allowance for individual differences in fitness or capacity in older people.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has particular international obligations to remove age discrimination under various treaties, most particularly under the International labour organisation's Discrimination (Employment and Occupancy) Convention 1958 (ILO 111).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current provisions of the Public Service Act are inconsistent with the thrust of the provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 which amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to provide that employers must not terminate an employee's employment on the grounds of age (s.170DF). The Government has chosen to interpret the Industrial Relations Reform Act so narrowly that in effect it exempts itself from the anti-discriminatory legislative measures it has itself introduced in the IRA legislation. The Commonwealth has argued that the anti-discrimination provisions of the IRA are confined to terminations at the initiative of the employer rather than terminations that occur as the result of the operation of the law, in this case s.76V of the PSA. One may well ask how, if the Reform Act is intended to operate universally, is it that a major employer, the Commonwealth, is not bound by it?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislative position at a Commonwealth level contrasts with the situation at a state and Territory level, where legislation relating to age discrimination has been passed by all Governments other than Victoria and Tasmania. In those states with anti-age discrimination legislation, compulsory age retirement is prohibited in NSW, Qld, WA and SA. It is exempt in the act until 4 March 1996 (at the end of which it will be prohibited), and it is exempt without qualification in the NT. It is worth noting that the states and Territories which have abolished compulsory age retirement do not report any significant difficulties with the changes to their public service employment conditions.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 the Government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies Report, Expectations of Life: Increasing the Options for the 21st Century gave in principle support to ending compulsory age retirement. However they have yet to act on this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Public Service Act Review Group (The McLeod Report) which was tabled in December 1994, concluded that compulsory age retirement should not be included in any revision of the Public Service Act:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 51: compulsory age retirement should not be included in the new (Public Service) Act,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Task Force, chaired by the Attorney General's Department, which is examining the issue was originally to report in Autumn 1991&mdash;four years ago! and has already indicated to the McLeod Review that it supports the abolition of compulsory age retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has raised a number of issues that have been used as excuses for not acting to abolish compulsory retirement age. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possible effects on the Comcare scheme. Under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 the entitlement to weekly payments ceases at age 65 for those injured after 1 December 1988. For the purpose of Comcare, 65 years is used as the deemed normal retirement age of employees and the current Comcare policy is not to move recipients of Comcare benefits onto Social Security until the retirement age of 65. If the age of 65 were to be removed as the normal retirement age, the current Comcare coverage policy would mean that there would be no point at which there would be a justification for ending the payment of benefits, apart from the death of the injured public servant.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are however various possibilities for "capping" the Comcare benefits                   paid to injured public servants if the standard retirement age of 65 were to be removed. These include a scheme modelled on the NSW option&mdash;which involves termination of payments after two years if the injury occurs when the employee is over 65.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ramifications in the area of superannuation. Currently membership of the Commonwealth's superannuation schemes is allowed after age 65; however the occupational superannuation standards set limits on the payment of contributions and new accruals of benefits after that age. The McLeod Report suggested that consideration be given by the Dept. of Finance and Comsuper to the feasibility of allowing more flexible working arrangements before retirement with minimal impact on superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Impact on young job-seekers. Some have argued that the presence of staff beyond age 65 discriminates against prospective new entrants in that they are occupying positions that other (younger) people might otherwise hold. In answer to this, there is evidence from other jurisdictions which have removed maximum retiring ages which suggests that there has not been a significant increase in the number of staff beyond age 65 who have sought to continue working. In addition it is a philosophically flawed argument to discriminate against one group in order to promote the rights of another group. This type of argument was used to preclude married women from participating in the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> Compulsory retirement on the basis of age is discriminatory just as distinguishing in employment on the basis of sex, marital status, religion and many other factors is discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For five years the Commonwealth Government has delayed introducing legislation to abolish compulsory age retirement in the Commonwealth public service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990 the Minister for Social Security gave an undertaking that he would remove age discrimination from all existing federal legislation. Nothing was done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 Senator Bolkus indicated that the Government intended to act BUT "the Attorney-General's Department is working towards the development of a comprehensive Commonwealth age discrimination policy". How long do we have to wait?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are the difficulties of drafting appropriate legislation so great? Surely if all states except Tasmania have either introduced age-discrimination legislation or are in the process of introducing it, the obstacles cannot be insurmountable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would argue that this Government is not committed to the abolition of age discrimination. If it was committed, it would have acted in the last five years to remove compulsory age retirement in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government had no trouble overcoming the many problems encountered in drafting the Mabo legislation or the Sex Discrimination legislation or the Racial Hatred legislation, all examples of changes it really wanted. But it has obfuscated and delayed any action on age discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it were committed to older Australians and the abolition of compulsory age retirement it would have acted before now. In the absence of Government action I am introducing this bill.</PARA>

<PARA>I believe that the referral of the Competition Policy Reform Bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee accomplished a couple of things. Firstly, it gave an opportunity to many of the groups affected by the legislation to raise questions about it and to seek clarification in many instances. This was the first time these groups had a chance to have any input or to gain first-hand knowledge of a major piece of economic legislation. Secondly, the committee hearings and submissions served to highlight the previously unacknowledged concern of the small business sector about how the national competition policy would affect it. We have heard much in the media about the benefits of deregulating water, gas, electricity and government-owned enterprises and how it would boost economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little attention before has been focused on how the competition policy would affect small business and local government. Small businesses are concerned that relaxation of some regulations would lead to both a lowering of service standards and an increased concentration of market power in the hands of a few. This view has support from economic academics, including Dr Richard Copp from the Queensland University of Technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major concern that arises as a result of committee hearings is the difficulty of getting straight answers about how the legislation will impact on small businesses and local government. This is not the result of a lack of cooperation. I congratulate the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, for attending the hearings. I also congratulate the officials from the Treasury and elsewhere who spent hours providing advice and clarification to the committee forums. I also have a number of separate private briefings from Mr Cassidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with this type of legislation is that the national competition policy bill assembles a framework to assist, review and reform anti-competitive behaviour wherever it is found in the economy&mdash;except the Labor taboo area of the labour market. The bill sets in place a reform process, but it does not tell us what the outcome will be or exactly what can be expected in small business and local government sectors. The bill imposes an economic philosophy&mdash;if you like, across an economy&mdash;and as such the experts appearing before the committee were handicapped in providing answers to specific questions about small business. We will not know the answer until the reform process is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of great concern to those in small business and local government who cannot determine how it will affect them and their members. Much hinges on the state governments. The legislative reform process, which every government must undertake at every level, will be the key to determining how small business will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obvious at the committee hearings that little thought has been given to this mammoth process which is likely to catch up many unsuspecting small businesses who, if they have ever heard of Hilmer, still think it has nothing to do with them apart from the ambitious extra $1,500 in every household pocket. The hearings showed that a kaleidoscope of the nation's small businesses will come under the Hilmer thumb. I presented four pages listing legislation that I have been advised will be scrutinised in the process of the review in Queensland alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was apparent that no-one at the hearings could provide definite answers on what would be the outcome of the reviews. It is of concern to the small business community that some of the reviews will be farmed out to the competition council and commission rather than being looked at locally by the state government. They are wary of the funding carrots being held out by the Commonwealth to enforce certain changes at state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government is in a similar quandary. As stated in the report, local government believes that the competition reforms will have a major impact on local government. Little work has been done to determine what this impact will be.

Unfortunately, the government's response has tended to be that it is providing&mdash;as Senator Boswell suggested&mdash;a carrot and stick approach to privatisation and competition policy through the states.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institution of Engineers said that, in its estimation, any major change of this nature should be planned very carefully, and the institute found it difficult to locate anywhere in the proposals the resources provided for this careful planning to be carried out. Either the Commonwealth is pushing the states to make these changes or it is not. If it is pushing them faster than they would otherwise be going, or if it is pushing them fast at this stage and pushing us quickly to make these changes, there is a responsibility there. The responsibility is to make sure that when we make these changes we are doing it fully cognisant of what the implications are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions that I asked during the hearings related to the experience of utilities in the United Kingdom. There has been a reasonable amount of discussion about this in the media at various times. We have had conflicting reports, political reports, about the implications of competition policy within the United Kingdom. Some people are saying, `There are serious ongoing problems,' and other people are saying, `No, we've got over this,' or, `They were only isolated pockets.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On questioning, the Institution of Engineers clearly said that there are serious ongoing problems and that they would be able to provide the committee with information on that. Unfortunately, that meant that we would have needed to wait at least two weeks to receive that information from the United Kingdom. But, no, we had to make the decision so quickly that we did not have the ability to look at that experience from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever you believe in relation to competition policy, I believe that it is not responsible for this parliament to be jumping in to actually legislate the changes until we have looked responsibly at what the implications are in those places that have made those kinds of changes. So, yes, we have heard some of the political debate about the implications in other countries, but it seems that it is not responsible unless we are prepared to look a little deeper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were, as we have heard, deep concerns from local government, largely about being left out of the consultation process. I have heard that on a number of occasions on a number of issues, including further discussion on such things as benchmarking that will be dealing with specific issues which local government will not be asked to participate in. So I am deeply concerned at this stage. That is why, whilst I acknowledge that the committee report acknowledges some of the serious concerns and the need to address those concerns, I am deeply worried that the recommendation is, `Let's go on with it anyway,' with undue haste without first working out how those serious concerns will be met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the tabling of this report from the chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, I am still concerned about the questions that I asked regarding clause 73, which were on competition in New South Wales with respect to the cartage and transport of coal. New South Wales is going to be in a very bad position as far as competition policy goes if its state government does not go ahead with the reforms such as the ones that Queensland has already signed off at. It is going to give the coal producers in Queensland a distinct advantage over the coal producers in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people that I am most concerned about are the coal producers in the Hunter Valley, for example, because of what I think is called `the third provider'. They will not get access to the reforms that other companies will if the New South Wales government does not go ahead in the way the previous coalition state government in New South Wales did. The submission put by the Hunter Valley rail project stated clearly that it was going to be at quite a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have with the coal industry in Australia is that we are at a disadvantage compared with our competitors in other countries in regard to freight rates. Our freight rates are something like $7 per tonne; we will have to reduce them by about $3 a tonne to really be competitive with other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the main concern that I have here, and one which I do not really think was answered to my satisfaction, is that the people who are producing coal in the Hunter Valley&mdash;up as far as Boggabri and out as far as Ulan on the other spur of that group&mdash;basically will not be a part of it. There will be a disadvantage for those people if the state government does not go ahead. As I understand it the state government is just going to leave it on the backburner for those people in that area for the next five years. I think that is something, as far as competition policy or the competition reform bill goes, that really has to be thought about. I am referring to clause 73. I believe there should be an opt-in, opt-out arrangement as regards the latter concern so that the reforms will go through to the end users, that is, those coal producers in those areas. </PARA>

<PARA>This report provides a summation of the events concerning the proposal to change the treatment of allocated pensions for the purpose of social security means tests, and the subsequent repealing of the proposed changes prior to them taking effect. The report canvasses the submissions and evidence provided to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on this issue, which assisted the government in forming its decision to repeal the proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the inquiry the committee heard evidence of a product valued among superannuants because of its simplicity, flexibility and regularity. Allocated pensions are a somewhat hybrid product. They provide a regular income stream as well as access to lump sums if required. This product is viewed as a means of moving Australia from a lump sum to an income stream system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered that the proposed amendments might not be necessary to address the perceived problem of double dipping. Therefore the committee met with the Hon. P.J. Baldwin, Minister for Social Security, and agreed to produce and present to him a preliminary paper. This was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Options for allocated pensions within the retirement incomes system</EMPHASIS>. Following the presentation of this paper to the minister, the government then decided to repeal the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the repeal of the amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 resulted in allocated pensions continuing to be assessed as retirement income streams rather than as managed investments. The outcome in this retirement income matter demonstrates again the positive role that our committee is playing in furthering retirement incomes in Australia, because it is only through diligence and open-mindedness that this occurs. The committee is an important one for the Senate, and I thank all of those who have participated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are wasting time again. When are we going to get on with the legislation; that is the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was seeking to present an argument that, with reasonable management, further sitting days would be unnecessary. I explained to the Senate that, during the last sittings, the government had lost control of its program. The Manager of Government Business had, in effect, abdicated his position and responsibility for management of the government's program in this place and had sought to recover his position in relation to his own environment portfolio. He lost the confidence of the environmental lobby when he, in part, had to bring in a Natalie to advise him on these matters at public expense. The embarrassment was such that he had to give all his attention to the portfolio and found no time to do his job in the chamber. As a result, government legislation did stack up towards the last session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This session, which was to be principally applied to dealing with the government's budget and financial bills that arose out of that budget, has now been cluttered up by the overlap of bills from the first session this year. The real question is: why should the Senate now have to return for extra sitting days due to the incompetence of the government? I see no argument for that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this year we have another nine sitting weeks. They were the weeks in which the non-financial bills were to be dealt with. There is no reason why they cannot be dealt with at that time in the course of this year, unless the government has other plans for the balance of this year. I remind the minister that, in a spirit of cooperation, I suggested that we come back a week earlier in the August session so that some of his backlog could be dealt with at that time&mdash;a time when the House of Representatives is not sitting. It seemed to us, in a constructive way, to be a good opportunity to help the government out of its problems, but it was not interested in that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The issue then arose that, if the government would not accept the extra week of sittings that we offered, what other options were available. There certainly was discussion about two extra sitting Fridays. My attitude, and an attitude that I conveyed to the minister, was that if agreement could be reached on a program&mdash;in other words, if the government were serious and put to us the program of necessary bills, principally being the financial bills necessary to implement the government's budget&mdash;we would be cooperative in relation to those two days. Unfortunately, that has not been forthcoming either. The government has sought to fix its daily program to pursue objectives other than the implementation of its budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, it was not until yesterday that the government finally started to bring budget bills onto the red. I think for the first time the government listed the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995 on the red. That was the first indication that the government was serious about seeking the passage of its budget bills during this session, which was particularly set for that purpose. I know that the government has said that some bills are still in the House of Representatives, but there are a number of bills with starting dates for the end of June and the beginning of July that the government could be putting before this chamber. However, it has so far chosen not to do so. The flexibility of this government when it comes to the push is particularly demonstrated in how it has dealt with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, a matter which my colleague Senator Short is particularly familiar with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what we have been told for days, weeks and months&mdash;that it was a bill of the highest priority. Senator Short had written to the minister responsible for that bill, Senator Bolkus, suggesting that it should be deferred until after the full court had handed down its judgment. It is a somewhat unusual legislative practice to seek to intervene with a legislative process&mdash;a parliamentary process&mdash;while the issue is still before the court.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Senator Bolkus. When the Manager of Government Business came in to address the issue of the timetable two sitting days ago, what did he say? In relation to this particular bill, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided not to proceed with consideration of that bill this sitting. We anticipate that by the time we return,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for the August sittings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the full bench of the Federal Court will have delivered its judgment on the appeal which is the subject of this legislation. That decision will either make the legislation unnecessary or put the parliament in a better position to debate its merits.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, after being asked so many times to act sensibly, the government came back and said, `Yes, we now concur and we will withdraw that bill.' In other words, `We will put the program into a more sensible shape and come back and address that at the proper time, which is after the Federal Court has handed down its judgment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we ask of the government is that if it can finally under pressure be sensible in relation to one bill, I am sure it should not be beyond it to be sensible in relation to others. When it comes in here and puts down its proper program to implement the budget, to get these financial bills through the Senate, it will find that it will be dealing with them quickly and expeditiously. We have always cooperated with the government's program but the manager of government business must finally learn that cooperation is a two-way street. When the government starts reacting sensibly and puts a sensible program before the Senate, the legislation will reach the top of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> more quickly than it does at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I just say what a farce it was last night. The manager of government business will remember that we objected to this new sitting timetable but it was forced upon us by agreement between the government and the minority parties. At 10 to seven last night, when we were here ready and waiting to debate government legislation, the Senate adjourned because there were no government documents to be debated. So short of the appointed hour, the Senate adjourned. That is because the structure of this sitting program that the manager of government business set in his agreement with the minority parties is flawed. It was flawed when it was debated at that time. We said so but, of course, the manager of government business knew better. The government should get the program in order and it will get legislation through much more quickly than it does at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that, unfortunately, it is necessary to apply some discipline to the government in this issue. Unless we do so it will continue to abuse the process of the Senate in the way that it has in the past and that is principally why we are objecting to these extra sitting days. We don't mind. We are full-time politicians. It makes no difference to me whether I am sitting in the chamber on Friday or doing other work pursuant to my obligations. I am happy to come back and sit on Friday but I would be happier to do so if the government was prepared to show some leadership in management of the program, which is its responsibility. On that basis, and in relation to the need to apply some pressure and discipline to this government, we are not supportive of the motion moved by the manager of government business. </PARA>

The opposition has, with great difficulty in many respects, worked towards facilitating the government's request made as long ago as the end of last year that this bill be introduced and its passage expedited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, although I do not think it adds much to the first paragraph of Senator Bolkus's response. Two sitting days after the minister told me that this is an urgent bill, that it has got to be passed, and that there is no possibility of having my sensible suggestion of deferral adopted, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) announced here in the parliament that the government had decided not to proceed with consideration of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) in this session. In justification of that, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We anticipate that by the time we return&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in August&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the full bench of the Federal Court will have delivered its judgment on the appeal which is the subject of this legislation. That decision will either make the legislation unnecessary or put the parliament in a better position to debate its merits.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Faulkner two days ago, in mounting his argument for two extra sitting days, said, `We have got rid of some of the legislation that is not really important.' The only bill he named was the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4)&mdash;the very bill that this government has been telling us for months is such an urgent bill to protect the integrity of Australia's onshore refugee determination processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner's statement here is absolutely and totally inconsistent with Senate Bolkus's letter to me&mdash;both as to the need for the bill to be considered this session and as to the future of the bill in the light of whatever the Federal Court decision is. To add point to what I have said, it was approximately 10 days ago that the minister's office phoned my office to ask whether we would allow part of another migration legislation bill&mdash;Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5), which seeks to temporarily extend the duration of the migration agents registration scheme&mdash;to be added to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasoning was that as Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) was urgent and was going to be debated last week and then again this week, whereas Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) was unlikely to be debated before the migration agent registration scheme expires in September&mdash;and that is a very dubious point anyway&mdash;the government wanted to tag on to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) part of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). In other words, the government was using it not only as an important bill in its own right but also as a tag for other items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute hypocrisy of Senator Faulkner's statement in justification for the dropping or the deferral of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) in his comments two days ago&mdash;comments which are absolutely and totally at odds with those of the responsible portfolio minister, Senator Bolkus&mdash;makes us extremely cynical of the government's motivation in all of the shenanigans that are going on now with the government's programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that you, Senator Faulkner, and you alone, have put the government's program in a total shambles. I do not know whether it is retrievable, even with the two extra sitting days. You are not going to get anywhere near what you said you wanted earlier on by way of the legislative program. As Senator Hill said, we offered you an extra week. You rejected that and now you come back with a half-hearted approach. You called it a minimalist approach in your comments the other day. You can hardly wonder why we are so concerned with your proposal and the cynicism and the hypocrisy behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for all those reasons that we are not prepared to accede to your request. Unfortunately, it looks as though your proposal may go through, because you have probably made some sort of arrangement with the minor parties. But that does not in any way absolve you from the responsibility for the terrible situation that the Senate now finds itself in with this legislative shambles.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot agree with this suggestion. As you are aware, the Bill forms a key plank in the Government's actions to maintain the integrity of Australia's onshore refugee determination processes. The legislation remains as important now as when I originally foreshadowed the measures on 30 December last year.</PARA>

Of course depending upon the decision of the Full Court there could well be an appeal to the High Court delaying significantly the ultimate resolution of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another factor in the Government continuing to seek urgent passage of the Bill is that the decision of the Full Court may not assist in clarifying the law. The outcome could turn on particular facts, or be limited in some particular way. The result may be lack of clarity, with the result that the precedential nature of Justice Sackville's judgement remains in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues in opposing the motion moved by Senator Faulkner. I have to say that I agree with Mr Beazley on one thing: he told the caucus that the Senate was in a complete, unutterable mess. I wonder whether Senator Faulkner's colleagues in the other place have woken up to what the real reason for this is. Senator Faulkner has presumably stood up in caucus and said, `Isn't it terrible the way I'm being treated over there by the Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals. It's all their fault.' I wonder how long that is going to wash with his colleagues over there, particularly with people such as Senator Robert Ray, who used to manage the program of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has precisely happened is this: Senator Faulkner and Senator Gareth Evans, unlike Senator Ray and former Senator Button, have no capacity to stand up to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister tells Senator Faulkner, `Go over to the Senate and make sure we put these bills on and make sure we try to cause as much trouble in the Senate as possible.' Of course, in the old days Senator Ray and former Senator Button would say, `Look, Paul, that can be done, but just remember that the program of the Senate is not entirely controlled by the government. It has to be done in cooperation with the other senators. If you want to do this, mate, it is going to cause some problems.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, Senator Faulkner does not have the guts to stand up to Keating. So he pitter-patters across here, wanting to show what a big, tough manager of government business he is. Yet when he comes into the Senate, we notice that he gives no priority to the government's real budget program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner wants to indulge in some politics, but he gives no priority to his own program, such as the migration bill to which my colleague Senator Short referred. As a consequence, as Mr Beazley said, the Senate is in a complete and utter mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any great truck for former Senator Button, or particularly for Senator Robert Ray. But in the old days they would have been able to give the leadership in the other place the facts of life. They would have been able to say, `We can indulge ourselves the way we have and we can occasionally burst into the press and complain about all the other people in the Senate. But the fact of the matter is, if you want your government program, you have to sit down and discuss it and make sure that it can be achieved with the cooperation of the Senate'&mdash;and we are more than happy to do that. But you did not do that, Senator Faulkner&mdash;you did not show the guts, you did not give the right advice to your own party. As a consequence, you, Senator Faulkner, have got yourself in this appalling mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic example of this mess was raised by Senator Short. Paul Keating has this bugbear against Senator Michael Baume. I am not too sure why he does, but it has to be admitted that the Prime Minister does not like Senator Baume all that much. Senator Baume, as a man who is prepared to raise controversial issues, is not liked by the Prime Minister, who thought that this was a good chance to get back at Senator Baume. So Mr Keating dumped his program for the day and said, `Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Faulkner, you go back into that Senate and you make sure that Senator Baume is censured.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, neither Senator Faulkner nor Senator Gareth Evans had the guts to actually tell Mr Keating that such a motion might not get through, would waste another enormous amount of time in the Senate and people would stand up and say, `If the government is not giving priority to its own program, why should other senators give a higher priority to the government's program?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, you did not give the right advice to the Prime Minister and you did not give the right advice to Mr Beazley and so you got yourself in a ridiculous mess. And that whole day was wasted&mdash;you did not get the motion you wanted through and, as a consequence, you have not learned the lesson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the first thing you should do, Senator Faulkner, is stand up to Mr Keating, tell him the facts of life on how the Senate operates, tell him that the Senate is not like the other place and that he has to negotiate his program through the Senate. There is a fund of goodwill in this place to make sure that we achieve a reasonable program. But if the government does not give a priority to its own program, it cannot complain about other senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me bring to the attention of honourable senators the sort of program that the government initially thought it was going to bring in. The government listed some 27 packages of 39 urgent bills and 16 non-controversial bills, making 55 bills in all. Is that correct, Senator Faulkner? That is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past statistics show that non-controversial bills take an average of about 30 minutes each. That leaves, making some adjustments for the time, only about 50 hours for the other bills. So, in order to pass all the other bills, the Senate would have an average of under one hour per bill. These are for all the other bills you have&mdash;these are the ones that are urgent and which cannot be considered non-controversial. It just simply cannot be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these budget sittings started, you did not put down a sensible program, Senator Faulkner. You did not come around and discuss a sensible program with the Australian Democrats, the Greens (WA), me and others to make sure that it could be achieved. Instead, you tried to play politics with your program. You did not give a priority to the bills you thought were important and now you come in and you are starting to complain. So I put it to you that the mess the government's program is in can be entirely sheeted home to Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner should have the guts to stand up in his own caucus and explain the real reason for the mess. I do not think he will because that requires him to take the responsibility on himself. I suspect we have spent two hours&mdash;or close to it&mdash;debating this motion. We would not have had to debate the motion if Senator Faulkner had been prepared to come to the table with a modicum of goodwill and negotiate a sensible program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made what I think is an extraordinarily generous offer&mdash;given the commitments colleagues presumably have made. We have said we are prepared to come back a week early in August to assist the government with its program. But there has been no response from Senator Faulkner. We will not support this motion. I suggest Senator Faulkner goes away and thinks about how he can give priority to the bills that are important and must be dealt with. Then he can come back and negotiate with goodwill how this can be achieved. Senator Faulkner should stop trying to play politics with his own program and should make sure he gives priority to the important bills. I am sure the Senate will respond appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until Senator Faulkner comes to the table and is prepared to negotiate on that basis, it is unlikely that he will achieve his program. It is an example of exceedingly poor management of the business of government. As I said, former leaders in the Senate would have been prepared to tell their colleagues in the other place&mdash;their leadership&mdash;the facts of life on this extremely important issue of the government's program. Maybe all this time in this debate could have been saved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few short comments on this motion to have two extra sitting days. I remind the Senate that at page 825 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate's proceedings of 5 June, Senator Faulkner says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the bills that has been on the government's forward legislative program for this session is the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4). The government has decided not to proceed with consideration of that bill during this sitting. We anticipate that by the time we return, the full bench of the Federal Court will have delivered its judgment on the appeal which is the subject of this legislation. That decision will either make the legislation unnecessary or put the parliament in a better position to debate its merits.</PARA>
<PARA>That appears to be an acknowledgment that the judicial processes must be exhausted on a vital issue such as this. I anticipate that the government acknowledges this ending up in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the government has been welcomed. Senator Short indicated that he had written to the minister to seek to ensure that the judicial processes properly proceed before we take a step in this matter. This decision of the government has been welcomed, I know, by a number of government members who are concerned about this legislation and has been welcomed by quite a large number of opposition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens and the Australian Democrats were opposed to the legislation because of its vile character. One Labor senator was reported by AAP on 6 June as welcoming the decision to delay the contentious refugee legislation. Senator Reynolds is quoted as saying that the bill would jeopardise Australia's reputation on human rights and women's issues. She indicated that it was wise for the government to wait until after an appeal court ruling and until after the United Nations women's conference to be held in Beijing in September. Those are very perceptive comments by Senator Reynolds, a senator who has been around this place for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is quite serious in its implications. It would not guarantee protection as refugees for people who have established a well-founded fear&mdash;and in the Chan case that means a `real chance' of coerced abortion, coerced sterilisation or other grave sanctions if they are returned to the People's Republic of China&mdash;and if that fear was established on the ground that the people involved were members of a particular social group, namely persons identified and targeted by the fertility control policies of the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to hear that the government has made a decision to delay that legislation. However, I note for the record that Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is still on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> as No. 27. Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), in the words of the government, is substantially the same as Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). Why is that? Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) was introduced into this chamber by the government on 1 March&mdash;more than three months ago. It is so urgent that it has not been debated since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it became clear that there would be substantial opposition to it&mdash;and it may even be defeated in this chamber&mdash;the government introduced Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) into the House of Representatives. The only reason that I can see why the government would have done that is to enable that bill to be a double dissolution bill. A bill that is introduced into this chamber cannot qualify as a double dissolution bill. In the government's own words, Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) is `substantially the same as Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3)'. I leave senators to make up their own minds about that. Having said that, I acknowledge the wisdom of the government in deciding to defer this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, doubt whether we are going to be able to get through all the legislation even with Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) out of the road. The debate on the competition policy bill will be enormous. Admittedly, it is important legislation. The government has given it priority. I suppose other people have also given it priority. It will need to be examined very thoroughly, particularly from the point of view of its effect on regional Australia and the smaller states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a whole raft of budget legislation to consider. We have the human rights bill, the bill to fix up the situation of `Brandy' and the racial hatred bill. You would have noticed the speakers list on the racial hatred bill and, by the looks of it, it will take at least a couple of days. I wonder whether it would not be better for the government, if it wants to keep it on the agenda, to at least put that bill back a little bit further so that we can get our teeth into some of these other substantial bills. I am supporting the government's motion for the additional two days of sitting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to briefly put on the record where the Greens stand on this motion relating to the days and hours of meeting. The Greens have always wanted to assist the government in addressing its legislative program, and I am sure all of our colleagues in the chamber want to do that. We felt concerned that the bills that were listed required prioritisation, because there were so many that it was impossible to say that we would accomplish the whole of the government's legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been pointed out that this is a very short session and that there is a long session scheduled for the end of the year. Maybe it is an error in judgment in planning for the year's program to have left a substantial proportion of time for the end of the year and only such a short time for the passage of budget bills and other urgent bills, and maybe we need to reflect upon that in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens were also concerned that we should not coerce the Senate to sit extra hours than those nominated in the advance program without reasonable consensus from our colleagues. The consensus of the Senate should be required to extend the hours. So, when there was a whips' meeting at which we were requested to have an extra week on the end of this session, that was not received with great acclaim or happiness by anybody in particular. It was actually Senator Panizza who suggested sitting on the Fridays, and that added an increased option. He actually tried, I believe, with his colleagues to have three extra Fridays for sittings, but eventually the opposition came up with the suggestion of these two extra Fridays. So it was, in our view, a consensus position that we offered to the government in order to assist the government to cover its program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition then, I believe, quite understandably, protested when it saw bills which it did not consider urgent listed ahead of budget bills and other bills. The opposition protested about sitting the extra days which it had suggested&mdash;and this presumably has led to its opposing this motion at this point in time. Because I have never made any secret of my concern about Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), I felt happy at least to consider supporting its opposition to this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not share&mdash;and I made this quite clear to the opposition&mdash;its concern that the racial hatred bill should not be debated this session. While I agree that it may not be very wise to have it so far up the program and that it would be better to put more urgent bills ahead of it&mdash;and I echo Senator Harradine's suggestion&mdash;I believe that we should be able to express our concerns about what the program is and whether it is urgent and warranted. I do not believe that it is sufficient to make me feel that the consensus that we want to assist the government's program has been lost.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opposition has a right to say that it does not consider the arrangement of the program is to its satisfaction, and I believe that is what it is expressing in opposing this motion. The Greens do not share that view. We believe that, whether we particularly like the program or not, we should extend the two days to the government to do that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to say in passing that the opposition parties and the Greens have been accused of delaying the Senate&mdash;and maybe I am even open to that accusation right now. Certainly, when we conducted what I believe was a very serious and legitimate censure motion, we were accused of wasting time. There has been a slight absence of civility and respect for the due processes of the Senate in some of the comments that the government has made, and I believe it has something to answer for when it lacks that civility and respect because that is what will delay the program from now on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are supporting the motion to extend the sitting by two days, but we can only support the due parliamentary process and consideration of legislation. We will not be responsible for what happens if the government obstructs or is rude and pretends that any questioning that comes from this chamber is of an obstructive kind and does not necessarily have a principled argument behind it. That is all I wish to say. I believe this chamber should accede to the government's request for the two extra days, and that is what the Greens (WA) will be supporting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A minute ago Senator Chamarette mentioned the arrangement we may or may not have made. I certainly admit to trying to organise three extra Fridays or three extra days for consideration of government legislation. But, when I did that, I intended it to be for urgent government legislation&mdash;that is, for start-up bills from 1 July and, of course, for the bills that were necessary to put this government's budget into place. I also believed that, being urgent, the budget bills and the start up of 1 July needed a lot of time for discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government is starting to come to its senses by attempting to run this Racial Hatred Bill as an urgent measure. I have always said to the government that we would be prepared to discuss that bill for a full week when we come back in August. One of the government advisers over there might think that is quite funny, but that is exactly what happened&mdash;that is the suggestion I made. I abhor this Racial Hatred Bill but, whether honourable senators support the bill or not, I agree that it is a bill that needs a thorough debate in this place. It is a bill that has a lot to do with personal freedom and freedom of expression in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I supported the extra three days in the belief that the government would use the extra three days. Of course, the third day was not available because that particular Friday was already set down for estimates; the estimates really could not be brought back into the week before we sat. That is the reason we came back to two days, and we were genuine about that. We were happy with the two days so long as we could get this urgent budget legislation up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at this program I might say that I will not speak one minute less than my allocated time when it comes to the Racial Hatred Bill. I will not advise any of my colleagues to talk for less than their allocated time. Senator O'Chee, like myself, is from an ethnic background, and I am sure he will speak to the bill. But whether we have an ethnic background or not, I believe it is a very important bill in so far as it could take away from Australians the freedom of expression. It needs to be well debated, so I will not be asking any of my colleagues to cut back on their 20 minutes if they wish to speak for that long. The bill could have been dealt with in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I agreed to the extra days on the basis that we would be doing urgent business with regard to the collection of levies and whatever else had to be put in place.

Senator Hill in his opening contribution in this debate talked about the role of the government mishandling estimates committees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a new system with the three parliamentary sessions where the estimates committees are in virtually continual session. My experience is that the difficulty we have in relation to the estimate committee process is because of the complete lack of discipline from the opposition, committee after committee, portfolio after portfolio, in its questioning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is so long ago that the government wanted to debate the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill. I think this was last debated on 29 May. I had about three minutes to speak on this bill at that time. To recap where I was up to&mdash;if I can remember quite where I was up to, because it was so long ago and I obviously do not know why the government has taken so long to bring on this government legislation for discussion&mdash;I think I was telling two stories about two people who could have been enrolled on the electoral roll. There was a person called Nigel Langford Black, who was registered to vote. His occupation was given as a leading hand. His accurate address was given and so was his name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the same election I think I was talking about a Samuel Bach, who was registered to vote or could have been registered to vote. His name and address were accurate. The problem was that neither Nigel Black nor Samuel Bach voted at that particular election. There was a very good reason for that: Nigel Black happened to be a donkey and Sam Bach happened to be a dog. I think the point I was trying to make when I last spoke on this matter was that there is no difficulty in any person or persons putting names on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been very easy for those persons claiming to be who they were not to have turned up and voted at a polling place. Most probably they could have voted five or six times. There was little to stop someone claiming to be either of those two names and then turning up and voting. A letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 16 April 1995 prompted me to talk about this issue. The letter was headed `Voting fraud'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former NSW Electoral Commissioner William Cundy is justified in worrying about electoral fraud</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cundy talked about it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 2 April&mdash;. . . particularly when you realise only 170 votes in three seats determined the State election outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is referring to the New South Wales election. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reality of elections today: a handful of people on key marginal seats determines who governs. Yet at the moment there is no onus on applicants for enrolment to prove their identity or place of residence. So an election could be "fixed" by a party by enrolling phoney names and addresses of their supporters in key marginal seats, then simply have those supporters vote on the fictitious names.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until voters are made to prove their identity at the point of enrolment and then made to produce a registration card to vote, there will be no guarantee that any government in Australia is democratically elected.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that in all those close elections it always seems to be the Labor Party that wins them. I leave you with those thoughts, Madam Acting Deputy President, because basically that is the concern a lot of people have in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I well remember what happened in the seat of Page at the last federal election. The Labor Party won that seat by 170-180 votes, but it was quite interesting to see the number of sectional votes. Sectional votes occur where people who claim to be on the roll are not on the roll but get their name put on it. They vote but, subsequent to that, people might find that they did not even live in that particular electorate. So you could very easily have people moving from one electorate to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter I quoted, I think, supports my concerns about the Electoral Act as it is at the moment with people who most probably are not even there but have a chance to vote. In the past people have talked about people voting from the cemeteries&mdash;dead people voting. I am not talking about that, I am talking about how it could be easily done at this particular stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill that we are debating, and on which I spoke for three minutes last Monday week, provides for the simplification of what the committee that reported on financial reporting by political parties saw as `unnecessarily onerous reporting requirements for registered parties'&mdash;parties that will now have to report particulars of their financial transactions in minute detail. The committee reported that `it was serving no useful purpose in achieving the policy objectives underpinning the original legislation'. In talking about disclosures and donations, in his second reading speech the minister said that the objectives were `to force disclosure of donations to candidates or their parties that might appear to influence a parliamentarian's or a political party's position in the parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Research Service provided me with a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Election funding disclosure and Australian politics: debunking some myths</EMPHASIS>. Under the heading, Does disclosure inhibit donations?', this research service paper, written on 29 March this year by Dr Rolf Gerritsen, the consultant to the Law and Public Administration Group, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This data set does not allow a firm conclusion. Nevertheless, the decline, in real terms, of corporate support for the political parties referred to above does indicate some unwillingness to contribute to the political process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anecdotal evidence, plus the claims of all the major parties' officials is that disclosure does reduce the incentive to donate to their campaigns. There is near-unanimity that some potential donors are reluctant to contribute to their favoured party because of the disclosure of their names. This seems anomalous in the nation that initiated the secret ballot. There is inescapably some tension between the requirements of disclosure and the right to privacy. This affects private individuals more than corporations. There is a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">prima facie</EMPHASIS> case for increasing the minimum donation required for disclosure. It is unlikely that any amount under $5,000 (in current dollar terms) could be construed as an attempt to influence the political process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the data analysed here, which gives us a unique view into the processes of Australian electoral politics, provide no grounds for alleging that improper pressure is being brought on Australia's political parties by their donors (which is not to say it could not happen).</PARA>
<PARA>How much pressure does the trade union movement put on the Labor Party for the donations they give? They seem to get appointed to every little board and they seem to have plenty to say on giving advice to the government. I would say that, in their donations, they get their real pound of flesh, or dollar of flesh, out of the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating seems to call in the ACTU for first consultation on many items of business. It gets consulted before people in the wider community. I suggest that the ACTU puts a bit of pressure on the Labor Party. That should be noted in this debate. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because any donor cannot . . . give sufficient funds to create dependence upon their financial contributions in any of our major political parties.</PARA>
<PARA>I would say that would be the case as far as the conservative side of politics is concerned&mdash;the Liberal and National parties. No pressure is ever put on when a donation is given to help in the political process&mdash;in the giving of free speech and policy and positions to the people of Australia. But the trade union movement definitely gets plenty of say in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in his speech, talked about how the Liberal Party and the National Party do different things so far as donations are concerned. But he did not mention anything about the trade union movement and its manipulative powers on the Keating Labor government. That movement has run this country&mdash;run it into the ground in a lot of cases&mdash;by pulling the strings and fiddling on the side with this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point in the bill is the recommendation for higher thresholds before individual donations have to be highlighted in returns. That is definitely a step in the right direction. The bill raises the threshold from $100 to $500 and for nominees to $1,500 as the sum which must be reported. The minister in his second reading speech was talking about the long gap between political parties and candidates running up campaign debts, and the receipt of funding. This has led to campaign directors having to get bank overdrafts to accommodate them until the future payment of their entitlement. This reform is a step in the right direction because that gap was cumbersome; and something needed to be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service charges on overdrafts in those cases could be very heavy and could be a big cost to the political parties involved. The burden will now be lifted because 95 per cent of that entitlement will be paid by the third Friday after polling day. If some of the proposals for the computerised counting system for the Senate are implemented, hopefully that time will become a lot shorter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of politics are not here to hold up this debate. I have waited for over a week to have a say: I had three-minutes say over a week ago on this bill. I support the fact that the Senate entitlement will now be the same as the House of Representatives entitlement. I entirely support the amendment moved by Senator Kemp which stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule, page 9, proposed subsection 314AEA(3), omit "(either before or after the commencement of this section)", substitute "after the commencement of this section".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been indicated, the coalition will be supporting the thrust of this bill but I want to make one important point to do with the philosophy of a participatory democracy. I think there is a danger in this bill in that it undermines popular participation in the democratic process and replaces popular participation with government subsidy. I think that is dangerous. I have discussed this bill with overseas friends in different countries and they all made the same point to me. They said, `Do not go down the Canadian way of subsidising lobby groups and political parties with the final consequence that ordinary people lose interest in the political process'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should be encouraging in this country is an open participatory democracy. We should be encouraging a democracy in which people feel free to become involved in a political party and, more importantly, a democracy in which people feel a sense of responsibility to become involved in a political party. There was a time in this nation when membership of a political party of either persuasion&mdash;now we have multitudinous persuasions&mdash;was something that people prized. There was a time when people saw it as their moral obligation, their duty, to become involved in some way in the running of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make to the school students who are listening to this debate is this: the future of this country relies upon ordinary Australians becoming interested in the political process and becoming active participants in the political process. This bill substitutes a government subsidy for active political participation. What this bill says to the political parties is that there is no need to go out into the community to recruit, to win people's support, to win their membership and their backing because the taxpayers' dollar will replace that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a democracy in which governments do not subsidise political parties, political parties are forced to win the hearts and minds of the populace in order to continue to function. The danger is that as we increase the level of subsidy we decrease the level of popular participation. We decrease the interest that ordinary people will have in politics because ordinary people will say, `Why should I bother getting involved in a political party? It is simply a small group of people&mdash;a little plutocracy&mdash;who live off the public purse'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the danger that this bill has for parliamentary democracy in this country. It is an inevitable consequence of this bill that political parties will become fatter and lazier and less responsive to voters and members because there is not the urgent need to continually recruit and to continually touch base. That is the danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happens for the simple reason that the government, in earlier legislation, discouraged people from becoming active participants and donors to political causes in which they believed because the government had this perverted, twisted sense that that was somehow wrong. It is a sign of a healthy democracy that people are free to donate to the causes in which they believe and are free from the threat of political victimisation which we have seen in my home state of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with the fundamental thrust that the government introduced some time ago. I believe that this bill does pose dangers to parliamentary democracy. I believe that it poses dangers to the stake that ordinary Australians feel that they have in political parties and in this parliament. If that is the case, then this parliament, this institution, will be the weaker by the passage of this bill. </PARA>

We have, over the years, properly made changes to continually tighten the disclosure requirements and to enhance the integrity of the process, but it has become incredibly complex.

<PARA>This amendment tackles what we believe to be a serious retrospective element in the bill relating to annual returns of associated entities, which will require details of the source of the capital even though that capital was contributed when there was no question of disclosure. As I pointed out in the second reading debate, contributions of capital made years ago when disclosure was not an issue were made under completely different rules. It is grossly unfair to require details of these donors, some of whom may well be deceased, to be made public under a new and necessary law. The amendment we propose will address this issue. It removes the need for disclosure of capital contributed prior to the date of effect of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill is, as has been announced, a bill that concerns disclosure provisions as well as funding provisions. While the Greens do not object to the disclosure provisions that are being changed to increase accountability, we do feel that the matter of public funding of political parties is a matter that deserves the attention of both the chamber on the public record and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dying moments of the autumn sitting of the Senate, the government, with the support of the opposition and the Australian Democrats, sought to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to double the amount paid to political parties for the votes they receive at federal elections. Those amendments were all recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and the bill containing them was first introduced into the House of Representatives in November 1994. On the morning of 9 March 1995 the Minister for Administrative Services introduced changes to the bill which altered the payment of electoral funding. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives with this change later that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behind this alteration lies a sorry tale of secret deals by the ALP, coalition and Australian Democrats to bypass the normal method of seeking change to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in order to avoid public debate on the funding of political parties. This is contrary to the principle that the mechanism which elects the people that make the laws should only be changed after significant public inquiry and debate, and only on the recommendation of the committee set up to evoke and foster the public consultation&mdash;the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That principle has operated since at least the 1950s, and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was created in 1987 to provide an ongoing process of scrutiny and improvements to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed change that the Greens (WA) senators object to was not recommended by that committee and has received very little public airing. Because of the delay in the legislative timetable, the Greens have made their concerns public. We have also discussed it within our own party, and it has received a very small amount of media attention. We believe that because this bill gives political parties $1.50 for every vote they receive at an election irrespective of how much money they spend on their campaign, it is a significant shift in policy which has deserved more scrutiny than it has received. </PARA>
<PARA>Public funding was, prior to this bill, then given on the basis of the costs of a political party's election campaign or an amount of money for the vote received, whichever was the smaller. There is a considerable cost to this change. The cost to the taxpayer will be over $15 million per election, based on the last election figures. The ALP and coalition will receive nearly an extra $7 million each. Under the change, the Australian Democrats will receive an additional $1 million and the Greens (WA) a further $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, therefore, registering our objection to this proposed change and seeking to amend the bill to bring it into line with last year's recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We want public funding of the election campaigns of political parties to be just that&mdash;funding of election campaigns. The funding process should not become a mechanism by which to publicly fund parties based on their electoral support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the rare occasions on which I am actually in agreement with Senator O'Chee. He expressed some concern about replacing popular support with public subsidy, noting that the capacity of a party to operate on its popularity and level of participation could be reduced through reliance on public funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree totally with everything Senator O'Chee said. While I support this issue being raised for discussion, the principle of public funding or public subsidy is not the problem here; it is the way in which that public funding is being provided. Anybody who gains more than four per cent of a vote becomes an involuntary beneficiary&mdash;and there is no ceiling on this public funding. Clearly, the change will not necessarily benefit the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are concerned that the threshold of four per cent is too high. If we wanted to enhance participation in the electoral process through public funding, it should be dropped to two per cent. In Mexico the subsidy threshold is only 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely use of this funding is also of relevance. I believe that the major parties have pressured this change because, with the disclosure provisions possibly discouraging private donations, they face considerable electoral debt. This measure is the sweetener in a bill that is intending to make political parties far more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greens from all around Australia&mdash;not just the WA Greens&mdash;believe that, since the general population has been asked to tighten its belt throughout this recession we had to have and to suffer the effects of downsizing and smaller budgets, there is no valid reason the major political parties should be exempt. If the funds are not immediately available perhaps that is a sign that we need to become trimmer and to look at the $15 million which is being made available through this legislation. It might be regarded as a drop in the bucket of public funding but funds are a scarce resource and there are many groups in the community which are desperately in need of assistance. While they have been asked to tighten their belts, we are on the verge of voting ourselves a funding windfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points to be made in presenting these amendments. One is that there has not been sufficient attention given to the process of making such a significant change to the Electoral Act provisions. The second is that this is a way of voting ourselves an immense windfall&mdash;of which, of course, the Greens would be happy recipients. While we do not receive anywhere near the amount of money that the major parties receive, we recognise that this public funding represents a greater proportion of our total funding. This mechanism doubles funding to the major parties but it quadruples the amount of money available for our electoral campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that we are not aware that we are beneficiaries; we are. We just believe that the change should have been acknowledged and that it should have had far more public discussion, because there are different viewpoints on it. There is no consensus in the community regarding this matter. It could have merited far better debate. I commend these amendments to the Senate as a way of saying that we have not given sufficient attention here. We should give it the rightful discussion across the committee process and across the community that it deserves. I was asked to sign a letter saying that we agreed with it. That was the first I had ever heard of this mechanism. I refused to sign it because I had not consulted my party. I was told at that time that all the other parties had signed the letter. That is the basis on which I make the accusation. Rather than a due process, there was a behind the scenes arrangement between the major parties because we would all be the recipients of this windfall. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly to three issues that need to be responded to. I agree with Senator Chamarette when she said that the whole process of disclosure has been part of the process of making political parties more accountable. That is absolutely correct and important. I am pleased she reiterated that and supports it, as I think almost everyone in this chamber does, some more reluctantly than others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points on which I disagree with Senator Chamarette. First, she has a concern that moving from a claim based system to an entitlement based system will somehow deny the public access to knowledge about any activities concerning electoral expenditure. The law will still continue to require political parties to disclose details of their expenditure; it just means that it does not all have to be done within a few days of the election consistent with the claim. If, by some bizarre process, a political party sought to spend less than its entitlement, it would be very strange. The party certainly would not be maximising its support. I cannot imagine why anyone would want to do that, but if anybody did it would be publicly disclosed, observable and commented upon in part of the democratic process of open accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way that people can make an underhand, undisclosed windfall out of this. It is simply getting some of the duplication of the bureaucratic process out of the system. It is a while since I have had to do any of this in a capacity as a party official. I have had to do it as a candidate in the election, but that is less onerous. Even in those days, there was a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy both for the political parties and for the government, which has to receive and process the documents. So it is wasting the resources of both the political parties and the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue on which I disagree with Senator Chamarette is her concern about the process. I do not share her fascination for the Senate committee process or the parliamentary committee process overall, although I do accept that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform has done a very good job over the last decade. It is a process that has enhanced our electoral process and smoothed a lot of minor amendments that do not go to major issues of partisan significance but improve the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary process is the ultimate sanction and the ultimate public accountability of changes to our laws. This bill is not being rushed through in the dead of the night. It was first introduced at least six months ago. First exposure drafts were circulated, as I understand it, in November and the bill was introduced in December. It is not one of those introduced one day, passed the next specials that sometimes cause concern to people. In terms of proper process, there is nothing to apologise for. It is a question of the public's assessment of whether it is an appropriate change, but it has majority support in the parliament. Overall, the bill will approve the accountability and operation of the electoral system, and I support it. </PARA>

The dilemma is how much disclosure is required and public funding. The reality is that the disclosure provisions which existed before this bill came about and which exist now are very onerous. A lot of people simply do not like to disclose to whom they give money; it just does not have to be a political party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a big bushel occasionally. I think there is a dilemma. We do not have to think this for sleazy reasons. A lot of people who would contribute to political parties simply are not prepared to have their names bandied around. It is not because they are trying to reach a special deal with a political party, but they do not want to become the subject of public debate and possibly follow-ups from political opponents. That process is not unknown. There is a real dilemma. Senator O'Chee raised it. I have some sympathy with what Senator O'Chee said. The disclosure provisions are enormously heavy and onerous and it has led to defunding of political parties. This was predicted at the time. I think those predictions have been fulfilled. On the other hand, we want to have a vibrant electoral system where parties can compete. It is always a problem to strike the right balance in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>

I did not note whether she said she would not be prepared to accept the funds which were available. I do note the commendable frankness with which she mentioned that her own circumstances will be substantially improved. In fact, she wanted to loosen the bill even further. She wanted to reduce the cut-off point from four per cent to two per cent, which would lead to a rash of smaller parties coming in, which may be a good thing or a bad thing. We have to strike a balance between making sure that people have a genuine claim to be part of the political process and take part in that process in an active manner, as distinct from trying to encourage people to come in so they can get hold of public funding. I suspect the four per cent cut-off point is appropriate. </PARA>

While I understand the concerns that have been raised, I believe that what is not understood is the onerous requirements that are now imposed, particularly on treasurers at branch level but also on candidates.

To put these requirements on them is to put enormous stress on the actual machinery within parties. I know that in the Liberal Party it is all volunteers as well, certainly at branch level. To have the requirements that we now have in place means that there is a doubling up&mdash;you keep one lot of books for elections and a separate lot as you put in your annual return.

They were not expecting any favours in return; they wanted it to be deliberately at arm's length. But now, with disclosure, those people who were absolutely clean and pure in their motives in donating to the party are no longer able to donate without the party actually knowing who the donor was. We would now find out through the public disclosure provisions. As a result, those people, unfortunately, feel somewhat exposed; they do not want any favours, nor do they want any publicity. They donate for the genuine reasons of contributing to the body politic of our society and to a particular cause&mdash;in my case, the cause is liberalism within the state of Tasmania.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette raised the question of whether or not amendments to the Electoral Act relating to an increase in election funding ought be brought before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. As I understand the situation, there is no obligation on the government through the Electoral Act or other sources, such as the committee's resolution of appointment, to refer amendments to the act to the committee for consideration. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate that most major changes to the electoral legislation go through the committee. As a matter of principle and as a matter of course, I do not think there is any argument with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its June 1994 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS>, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, on the question of election funding at page 9, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, a Senate vote attracts half the amount of public funding of a House of Representatives vote, where elections for the two Houses are held together. The rates payable at the 1993 election were 100.787 cents for a formal House of Representatives first preference vote, and 50.393 cents for a formal Senate first preference vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was then discussion by the committee as to whether or not a Senate vote ought to attract the same consideration as a House of Representatives vote.

Whilst I accept and understand Senator Chamarette's concerns that amendments to the legislation relating to this aspect ought be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the actual principle was touched upon in June 1994&mdash;some 12 months ago. The committee, for reasons undoubtedly best known to itself, did not make any suggestion as to the actual level of funding. As a result, the government took it upon itself to make this proposal&mdash;which, might I add, has been in the public arena now for some considerable time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of the development of the arguments for the public funding of political parties. There was considerable discussion, both philosophical and practical, about that question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very serious consideration was given to the issue of whether we should tie public funding for political parties to a cap on expenditure by those political parties for the purpose of elections and for the general running of the political parties between elections. That is really the issue. If political funding is to be used only as a top-up for the private donations that political parties accrue, the result will be that more and more money will be expended by political parties in election campaigning. This will be done in a manner, as has been seen, that does not really help in informing the public during election times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody around this chamber would surely suggest that all political advertising is simply to inform the potential voter about the programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once this amendment is put to the chamber and decided upon, I will be asking the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, to inform the Senate, from the date when the public funding first became law, of the rate of increase of expenditure for political campaigns in each year in which returns have been made.

If we ask people in the electorate, `Do you think $15 million of taxpayers' money ought to go to political parties?' we will find that nine times out of 10 the answer will be no, particularly if it is just going to mean that there will be extra money for political advertising of the slick variety to bombard the voter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Abetz for raising that issue because I do not think I made clear enough my stance on what the amendments actually do. The reason why they do not address the question of funding is that this did not go through the process of discussion at the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Senator Abetz quite rightly pointed out that the amount per vote was an issue discussed in that committee. He also quite rightly pointed out that we agreed there should be an equivalence of amount for the Senate vote and for the House Representatives vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at that discussion. I joined in and agreed with the recommendation. We specifically did not set an amount. We did not put any constraints on the government as to whether it should reduce the House of Representatives vote to 50c per vote or increase the Senate vote to a dollar. I do not recall any of us anticipating a mutually beneficial increase to $1.50. So I have some concerns about the amount that has been nominated, but I did not feel as free to stand on my principles in relation to the process because we had actually made a recommendation to the government from the committee that there should be an equivalence of vote. So it was not an issue that had not received discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making was that the subtle change, that the refund should be available to political parties on the basis of their primary vote rather than on their campaign expenditure, was slipped in in March to an amended version of the bill that was passed in the House of Representatives. That had the double benefit that, firstly, unless we were vigilant we would not have seen it and, secondly, that particular matter had not come through the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am concerned that the amount of increase may not be warranted in relation to the constraints that other people in the community are suffering, the change that I am asking to be reinstated is the one that has not received that kind of scrutiny. While it seems a subtle shift, it is a very major one in the amount of money that would be available to political parties. So it is on that basis that these amendments simply reinstate the previous existing situation of the bill without addressing the issue of the amount of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again flag my concern that we are doing this without necessarily demonstrating that that $15 million is a very significant change to public funding and we have not given it the discussion it warrants. And I thank contributors to this discussion because I believe that it has received better discussion&mdash;and that was partly my reason for moving the amendment. I am quite able to see that I do not have the numbers to reinstate the former position, but I will be calling a division on this simply because I am forced by the nature of the bill to support the bill at the final vote and I will not be causing any division on that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Abetz for standing aside to allow me to make this contribution which I believe is of some importance. In the small hours of the morning on 25 May, after 14 hours of emotionally charged debate and 50 or so amendments, 15 people made it legal for doctors to administer death; to expunge life at the request of a terminally ill patient. These 15 ordinary, fallible politicians, members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, were the first legislators in the world to take this step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has called for a national response to euthanasia laws. What is important, she says, is uniformity&mdash;as though death requires standardising like rail gauges or share transaction charges. Other states are feeling the pressure to legislate accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset, it is important to accept that neither the advocates nor the opposers of euthanasia have a monopoly on compassion or understanding suffering. All protagonists love their parents, children and spouses and wish to reduce their pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory, like other decentralised parts of Australia, perhaps sees less of the ways suffering can be relieved and managed. According to a palliative care specialist, the Top End has, `no medical oncologist, very little radiotherapy services, not a single palliative care program and no hospice'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on euthanasia is itself a harrowing one, contemplating and confronting life and death. It divides families, communities, political parties and parliaments. To enjoin Australians in this divisive process, the euthanasia bill's proponents must have felt that there was great injustice being done and great injury to human rights and dignity. They thought euthanasia so necessary as to justify the inevitable division and the outcry from Australia's churches and medical communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a national perspective, it is difficult to argue that legislative change is warranted by widespread community dissatisfaction with the status quo. In 12 years as a senator, I have received tens of thousands of letters from constituents on all sorts of issues, but never one on euthanasia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Table Office checked its records back to 1973 and found no petitions on euthanasia. The word `euthanasia' appears, for whatever reason, only 16 times in the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> since 1983. Euthanasia, by its very scope and nature, cannot confine itself within state borders, nor escape attention in the federal parliament. Internationally, there is no push to introduce euthanasia. But, as a result of the decision of 15 people with the authority of a legislative assembly, Australians everywhere are being asked to consider euthanasia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the concern I see in the electorate, I am compelled to raise the issue of euthanasia in the Senate. I do not see that it should be ignored or can be ignored. I do not see that it should be left to others. I do not see that the fact that some doctors admit to practising euthanasia is an argument for its legalisation. The fundamental objective of governments is to protect the life, law and liberty of its citizens. The protection of life underwrites our judicial and social systems. If the duty of government is subrogated, it becomes a wedge, opening the door to further erosion of the protection of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 House of Lords report of the Select Committee on Medical Ethics found that it would be impossible to set secure limits on voluntary euthanasia. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issues of life and death do not lend themselves to clear definition, and without that it would not be possible to frame adequate safeguards against non-voluntary euthanasia if voluntary euthanasia were to be legalised. It would be next to impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary, and that any liberalisation of the law was not abused. Moreover to create an exception to the general prohibition of intentional killing would inevitably open the way to its further erosion whether by design, by inadvertence, or by the human tendency to test the limits of any regulation.</PARA>
<PARA>For the first time, intent to kill no longer constitutes the mens rea of murder. Now we must add motive, or the reason why the intent was formed. Euthanasia is intent to kill but will not be murder. The onus to prove the motive for murder will be on the law enforcement authorities. The 1994 House of Lords report canvassed the issue of euthanasia thoroughly. It found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, however, we do not believe that these arguments are sufficient to weaken society's prohibition of intentional killing. That prohibition is the cornerstone of law and of social relationships. It protects each one of us impartially, embodying the belief that all are equal. We do not wish that protection to be diminished and we therefore recommend that there should be no change in the law to permit euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We acknowledge that there are individual cases in which euthanasia may be seen by some to be appropriate. But individual cases cannot reasonably establish the foundation of a policy which would have such serious and widespread repercussions. Moreover dying is not only a personal affair. The death of a person affects the lives of others, often in ways and to an extent which cannot be foreseen. We believe that the issue of euthanasia is one in which the interest of the individual cannot be separated from the interest of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Netherlands has been frequently cited as a reference point for any discussion on euthanasia, although, even there, they do not have legislation explicitly permitting it. However, the results of euthanasia in the Netherlands provide an example of what could happen here. It should be noted that Australia's population of 18 million is greater than the Netherlands's population of 15.24 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence presented to the House of Lords committee showed that there are 2,300 cases annually of euthanasia in the Netherlands and another 400 of assisted suicide. There are 1,000 cases annually where a patient's life is terminated without the explicit request of the patient. In 41 per cent of those cases, the patient was not competent to discuss the proposed course of action. The justice minister for the Netherlands commented recently that she saw no reason why involuntary euthanasia should not be legalised and that euthanasia should be permitted even for persons not in the terminal phase of an illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of an Australian parliament will listen in silence while an attorney-general reports the number of euthanasia deaths, `as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year' as mandated by the legislation. Would people be able to blank from their minds that some of those deaths would not have been voluntary: names and faces and lives they never knew but had sentenced to death through an act of parliament; human beings whose passage to death was subsidised by Commonwealth taxes via Medicare funding agreements, rebates and pharmaceutical benefits, as confirmed by Senator Crowley last week?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a society, we must take responsibility for our sick and our dying. Through this debate on euthanasia, I have learnt that we do not do that nearly well enough. The House of Lords committee strongly recommended the development and growth of palliative care services, research into pain relief and symptom control and the importance of individual dignity in the long-term care of dependent people. That is our compelling responsibility. That is where a national debate on the rights of the elderly, dying and disabled should truly start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that euthanasia is the easiest solution. Its very existence devalues the work and perhaps the funding of palliative carers and researchers. As Professor Lickiss, Director of Palliative Care at Sydney's Royal Prince Albert Hospital, commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a country of creativity as well as compassion and we can surely improve the care of our people without resort to euthanasia, a violent solution, which impoverishes the human&mdash;and medical&mdash;community. We have not, as a nation, become so impoverished, nor as a profession have we gone so far astray.</PARA>
<PARA>Contrast this approach with the callousness of the prominent advocate of pro-euthanasia, Dr Helga Kuhse. At a conference on the right to die, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we can get people to accept the removal of all treatment and care&mdash;especially the removal of food and fluids&mdash;they will see what a painful way this is to die, and then,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the patient's best interest, they will accept the lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, Australia owes much to its multicultural heritage, but it seems to me that euthanasia is a particularly white man's way of dealing with a problem. In our parliaments, some would argue that we go to extraordinary lengths to protect Aboriginal secrets. Our legislators are, by world comparison, sensitive to the views of different cultures. Ethnic communities are powerful lobbyists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, in the Northern Territory, home to the greatest number of traditional Aboriginals, this perspective has been lost when it comes to white man's euthanasia. In a submission to the Northern Territory select committee on the euthanasia bill, the Aboriginal community of Milingimbi wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are nomads, hunters, food gatherers, ceremonial and cultural people who just want, and will give, comfort and tender loving care to our terminally ill relatives. Because our terminally ill relatives know that they are dying, they usually always want songs to be sung, they want to hear the last sound of their traditional songs and the sound of the didgeridoo and clapsticks . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Resource and Development Service Inc., part of the Northern Regional Council of the Congress of the Uniting Church, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dying is seen as something that should occur naturally, even for people who are terminally ill, and any intervention by an outside person or agent should not happen, as it will be immediately seen as an act of murder or sorcery.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill passed by the Northern Territory is not about refusing medical treatment. That right already exists. It is about actively taking another person's life. Fifteen people at 3 o'clock in the morning assumed the competency to judge the quality of another person's life against a background of inadequate care facilities. As a Daly River resident put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please spend the money on hospices so that the terminally ill have a choice and do not feel they are a burden on their loved ones.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, this year we celebrate the triumphs and the legacy of the end of World War II. `Australia remembers' is the slogan on caps, rulers and key rings in the shop in the Parliament House foyer. But do we remember? Have we forgotten the urgency with which countries got together after the war to come up with some basic principles on civil and human rights in an attempt to prevent the circumstances ever rising again that led to Nazi atrocities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 50 years, euthanasia has metamorphosed from a Nuremburg war crime to legalised compassion. The Germans never saw the door they were opening. They, too, believed their initial intentions were honourable and compassionate. Leo Alexander, an observer at the trials of Nazi doctors at Nuremburg, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It started with the acceptance of the attitude, basic in the euthanasia movement, that there is such a thing as a life not worthy to be lived. This attitude in its early stages concerned itself merely with the severely and chronically sick. Gradually, the sphere of those to be included in this category was enlarged to encompass the socially unproductive, the ideologically unwanted, the racially unwanted and, finally, all non-Germans. But it is important to realise that the infinitely small wedged-in lever from which this entire trend of mind received its impetus was the attitude towards the non-rehabilitable sick.</PARA>
<PARA>Why should we have so much faith in ourselves that abuses would never happen here? Australia has its own dark corners of hate and prejudice: blood-red swastikas on a grave, sarin on Australian soil, anti-Semitism and extremist propaganda. Adopting that `it could never happen here' syndrome means that we are blind to the existence of those dark corners in the human psyche, and blind to the real lessons of World War II, when the insanity of a few infected the reason of many at the cost of human life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, I accept your interjection. I am confident that it is acknowledged by those on both sides that Senator Ray is an eminent senator who is universally respected in this chamber, and, indeed, in this parliament. I am disappointed that, even though Senator Ray is exonerated, the response to the situation is a question which, although in its terms is a legitimate question and is not framed in abusive tones, nevertheless contains the imputation that the investigation conducted by the Federal Police is tainted.

It is disappointing that circumstances are allowed to occur so that innuendo, subtle though it may be, is allowed to emanate through this chamber.

There is no evidence of that, and, therefore, the Criminal Justice Commission should not, in any way, be held responsible until it is shown otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suggestion is occasionally made that out of frustration investigating bodies sometimes release information to damage people publicly because the investigating officers are unable to proceed against them in the course of their duty. In other words, there is no evidence that can be safely relied upon by those investigating officers and they therefore use other methods, including the method of publicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed earlier this year that Sir Paul Condon, the commissioner of metropolitan police in England, was concerned that the police under his charge did not have enough weapons to proceed in a way he thought appropriate. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>It is a very serious issue when a very senior police officer talks in terms of `noble cause corruption'. What he is saying is that, if the police are not satisfied with parliament and the legitimate institutions of this land that set out these standards by which police might act, they must use corrupt methods&mdash;methods other than those which are given to them by parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with a matter which I think is very much of public importance and public interest, particularly to many workers in an industry in Tasmania&mdash;namely, the forest industry. On 23 March this year I gave notice of a motion that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee conduct an inquiry into certain aspects of conduct of the operations of forestry authorities in various states. To date I have not been able to get support for that notice of motion, even though it was agreed to by, I think, all members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very reasons I sought to do that was because of the circumstances that currently exist in the industry within Australia and, more particularly as it relates to Tasmania, which is the state that I know best. Some of the existing practices simply are not lending themselves to a forest industry achieving better outcomes for this country in social and economic terms. They are also not lending themselves to better management of our forests&mdash;in particular, our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing those concerns, and the unfortunate fact that we have not been able to allow the committee to proceed with this inquiry, I just want to highlight some circumstances that exist to show why this inquiry is so very important. The forest industry has not been without its inquiries. We have had umpteen inquiries into the forest industry, many of which I would have said were not even relevant and many of which, I would have thought, were politically motivated. But, of course, the one I sought to pursue simply was not. It was based on trying to achieve a better outcome for the industry, to allow the industry to achieve its full potential and allow it, as I said, to deliver better both socially and economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forestry Tasmania, a corporate body which used to be called the Forestry Commission, has the responsibility for management and control of the state's crown forests. One of the very concerning things that has been allowed to continue in Tasmania is a concessional rights system under which an area based concession is granted to a particular company. This arrangement, which has been legislated for in the parliament, has been in operation for many years. Of course, we would probably have to accept the fact that, in the days when concessions were granted, they had some relevance on the basis of encouraging investment, particularly in the area of paper making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is a new age and we have a responsibility as a community to ensure that we achieve a better outcome from the natural resources that we take, either from forests or out of the ground, in so far as there are economic benefits and, in particular, employment benefits that must flow from something that is, after all, the public's resource. What has happened in Tasmania is that in 1991, and as the result of a state Labor government effort, legislation was introduced into the parliament, and ultimately passed, to bring an end to the concessional rights system. The legislation effectively sought to change the whole practice of the way in which wood from public forests is sold to customers of the Forestry Commission, now Forestry Tasmania. It was proposed that the wood be sold on a volume basis rather than through the concessional rights system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concessional rights system has in effect led to what in my view is a misuse of the forest resources, in such a way that ours has become a pulpwood driven industry. As most senators would be aware, there was much debate prior to Christmas last year about export woodchips. Even though there were some unfortunate consequences of that debate and the circumstances that led to the debate, we have not sorted out the real issues for the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania we have a situation where the commission categorises the type of wood taken from the forest. Under the allocation system, it has an obligation to what are known as crown sawmillers to provide a certain amount of category 1 and category 3 sawlogs. Category 2 sawlogs are produced and then sold on the basis of demand. Then we have a new category of logs known as category 8, which effectively have no specifications set by Forestry Tasmania. There is no requirement on the current industry participants in the sawmilling sector to utilise these logs. They can utilise them on the basis that they seek to do so. Outside of that, most category 2 sawlogs, which in all other states sawmills would be required to take, ultimately end being woodchipped. That is simply because of the way the industry is conducted in our state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a sad state of affairs. Nobody would argue about the jobs in this industry being in the sawmilling sector&mdash;the processing sector. That is exactly what we have to deal with. If you have a system of selling wood from the crown to a customer that is flawed, then it should be changed. That is what I sought ultimately to bring out, as a result of seeking some inquiry: to identify the circumstances that were wrong, to see if we could get some remedy to those&mdash;because I believe there is a remedy to them&mdash;and to get onto greater processing of wood taken from the forests in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, in terms of looking at logs that are currently woodchipped in Tasmania, I have photographs that were taken on 25 April 1993 at a railway siding. They are photographs of logs that are destined for the woodchip mill, but there is no way that logs like these should be destined for a woodchip mill. Indeed, many people have proposed that by way of introducing recovery mills, whether they be flitch recovery mills or recovery sawmills, they can cut those logs into face grade material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a photograph taken on 27 May 1993 of logs that someone has put up a proposal for processing to the Tasmanian Forestry Commission in 1992. In 1992 he put a proposal to the Forestry Commission to put flitch recovery mills at each of the woodchip mills that were in existence in Tasmania at that time. We now have an additional one, but at that time we had three. The proposal would have seen somewhere in the order of 200,000 cubic metres of recoverable wood produced, which could have been channelled into the existing processing industry. To put that in context, 200,000 cubic metres is around 60 per cent of what is currently being used by the entire crown sawmilling industry in Tasmania. That is the sort of figure we are talking about. Take the number of jobs that exist in the current sawmilling industry in Tasmania and multiply it by 60 per cent, and there would be a lot more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current state government has made some small effort about dealing with processing plants. It has made a few announcements about medium density fibreboard plants and it has made another announcement about a fibre form plant. Also we have had some indication from the Taiwan Pulp and Paper Corporation about building a pulp mill. But nowhere is there any evidence that any of these things are being progressed so that they might come to fruition. In fact, I think that the state government and its authority have been doing exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for my view is based around a letter from the Forestry Commission to a proponent of a particular development. The commission wrote this letter on 8 July 1993 to a person who was proposing to build flitch mills. In part, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As previously indicated, the Commission is at various stages of negotiation with a number of proponents interested in using pulpwood available in our forests. For some the interest is in the southern forests, while for others it is in the north-west of the state.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware, a high degree of cooperation with the chip exporters&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the manager of the crown forest&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be necessary because your proposed operations need to tap into the flow of logs they have previously utilised and relies upon them for the sale of residues. In addition, the Commission does have ethical, legislative and contractual obligations with these customers and wishes to ensure that no disadvantage accrues to existing industries.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to say that any state government that would suggest and, in my view, actively oppose somebody who was proposing to improve the recovery of wood taken from our native forests is highly questionable. But it gets worse. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, we have discussed the cooperation issue and related matters with some of the people in the industry and within the Commission itself. We have identified a few issues which need to be resolved jointly at your earliest convenience. None are seen as insurmountable hurdles.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember, this is 8 July 1993. Then there are a number of points that are set out as the not too insurmountable hurdles. It says in point 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Residues can be taken by the chip exporters only in the form of offcuts. That is, they do not want to buy chips.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who has got any knowledge about having a recovery sawmill has to understand that the only way it can be made economically viable in terms of the residue that will be produced, because it is actually cutting up lower grade logs, is to have some form of in-line chipper. It is simply not economically viable, or it is very difficult to make it economically viable, in terms of the volume of residue that will be produced to actually then have to reload that and pack it off at your expense and send it to some woodchip plant. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purchase of residues by the chip exporters cannot reduce the quality of their product mix.</PARA>
<PARA>Forgive me for being somewhat naive but I thought that the woodchip industry, from its inception, was designed to actually utilise all of the low-end, low-grade quality wood that could not be used for other purposes. To have the representative authority of a state government, which is managing the state forests, putting this down in writing is ridiculous. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements to be set in place between the Commission and your company must not place additional cost burdens on the existing users of the pulpwood resource.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, if that is not active dissuasion against a person who is proposing better utilisation of the forests, I do not know what is. Given this, I would encourage the members on the other side of the chamber&mdash;and I am happy to provide more evidence to them&mdash;to consider the position of the inquiry that I have proposed and allow it to proceed. To do otherwise is simply aiding and abetting what can be, it has to be said, almost corrupt practices of a state forest authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to inform the Senate of a recent visit that I made to Portugal, as a guest of that government, in relation to a conference dealing with the situation in East Timor. The conference was held last week from 31 May to 2 June. There was a delegation from this parliament comprising my National Party colleague Senator McGauran, and members from the other place, Mr Gary Gibson, member for Morton, and Mr Ted Grace, member for Fowler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade acknowledged in its report last year dealing with Indonesia that the situation in East Timor is the greatest difficulty that this country has in its relations with Indonesia, and so it should be. Some 32 countries were represented at this conference and there would have been over 150 delegates from a variety of political strains, and racial and ethnic backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference concluded with a Lisbon declaration. I will deal with the terms of that declaration. In the first instance, the declaration was proposed by the Portuguese delegation. However, it was felt by delegates that perhaps there was not sufficient substance to the declaration, as such, and that there should be a specific plan of action. So it was that His Honour Mr Justice Kirby, the Chairman of the International Commission of Jurists&mdash;I believe that was the capacity in which he attended the conference&mdash;drafted some 23 points as a plan of action. Lord Avebury from the United Kingdom also drafted a plan of action. At the conclusion of the conference, we were successful in having both of those plans of action incorporated into the Lisbon declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Justice Kirby for the excellent submission he made to the conference and the work that he put into drafting these 23 points comprising a plan of action. Australia was well represented by the delegation that attended this conference, a delegation which represented the diverse, domestic political views in this country. I think that Australia's standing was advanced both by the efforts of the delegates who attended and, in particular, by the contribution made by His Honour Mr Justice Kirby. The declaration, as proposed by the Portuguese delegates, in summary, recommended that, inter alia, Indonesia accept the various United Nations resolutions which have been passed in relation to the East Timorese question, that political prisoners be released, that an arms embargo be placed on Indonesia&mdash;due to the current situation in East Timor&mdash;and that there be a resolution to the problem which is internationally acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more specific points raised by Mr Justice Kirby dealt with such matters as: increased parliamentary visits to East Timor; parliamentary pressure to continue to be applied by way of resolution; United Nations action involving a visit to East Timor by the High Commissioner for Human Rights; pressure on the Secretary-General to call on Indonesia to comply with the recommendations of the special rapporteur on summary executions; the collection of sound data and information on the situation in East Timor, such as the number of extra-judicial killings; increased presence of the Red Cross and UNICEF in East Timor; and consideration of the use of the genocide convention in respect of any alleged cases of genocide. There was also a further recommendation that the Inter-Parliamentary Union add East Timor to its list of concerns. For his part, Lord Avebury recommended that there should be coordination between parliamentarians who support the rights of East Timorese. I think that is a sound recommendation and one which could only advance the cause of the East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For his part, Lord Avebury recommended that there should be coordination between parliamentarians who support the rights of East Timorese.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Lisbon declaration with these plans of action&mdash;and I have only touched on some of them&mdash;was a worthwhile result from this conference. This conference has been timely for two reasons. Firstly, whilst that conference was being held, a boatload of East Timorese people arrived in Darwin in the Northern Territory. These people were seeking refugee status in this country. Secondly, on 3 June, at the conclusion of the conference, the United Nations sponsored a meeting in Austria between the various East Timorese groups and the Indonesians. Indeed, this initiative is a very good one. I think it is perhaps one of the more remarkable steps forward in relation to this matter in the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not touch on the case of the East Timorese people seeking refugee status here today. Perhaps that will be dealt with at another time. The fruits of the meeting of the United Nations in Austria remain to be seen. I can only hope that good will come of it. It may be that further meetings have to be held and that, in turn, will only be positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot ignore the history of this matter. As I mentioned previously, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs looked at the question of East Timor and our relations with Indonesia. It found evidence which supported the deaths of some 200,000 East Timorese as a result of causes directly or indirectly attributable to the integration by Indonesia. Furthermore, there has been acknowledged suppression of East Timorese culture and language. There has also been an interference with religious freedom in that country. Religious practice there is predominantly Catholic and recent events have taken place in relation to the practice of that religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, this year there have been incidents mentioned at Baucau, Dili and Liquica. These incidents must also be taken notice of and must be the subject of great concern by this Senate and all parties represented here. The government, of course, has protested strongly in relation to these recent events and, in the past, has protested to the Indonesian government in relation to the abuse of human rights in East Timor. I think that is a proper course of action to take. In a speech to Amnesty International, Alexander Downer recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can't simply speak with a loud voice when injustice occurs on one side of the world, while whispering softly or remaining silent when similar events take place within our own region.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement has a universal application. It is much easier for countries that are well removed geographically from this problem to voice strong concerns; it is perhaps easier for us as a country to voice strong concerns about matters which occur on the other side of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, the state of Western Australia, which I represent, has its northern coastline only a few hundred kilometres from the country of Indonesia, the place where these events are occurring. Whilst it is imperative that we have very good relations with Indonesia, it is also imperative that that relationship be based on honesty and frankness, and that includes a frank approach to the question of human rights by Australia. I support Alexander Downer's suggestion that there could well be an Asian Pacific human rights body which could have some influence in curbing human rights abuses in the region. It is not only East Timor that we are looking at. There is also the question of Burma, Tibet and other places in the region which could well be the subject of some scrutiny. I believe that countries such as Australia and New Zealand have a crucial role in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some positive aspects in Indonesia recently. One is the establishment of the national human rights commission. That has been greeted with some scepticism, and I would say to the Senate that it is up to this Senate and the parliament of this country to monitor closely the performance of that body, to give it every encouragement, and to ensure that it achieves what it has set out to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of international concern about events in East Timor, and I would suggest to the Senate that the concern is bipartisan. This was evident at the conference which I attended. The delegation from Australia represented all spectrums of thought, and this applied to those other countries which were represented there. More recently, in March this year, we have had the Oceanic catholic archbishops conference expressing solidarity with the struggle that the East Timorese people are undergoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of great importance to Australia. I believe that the Portuguese initiative in holding this conference was a very good one, and for that I congratulate them. I would, however, state one thing. The case that Portugal has in the International Court of Justice can perhaps be confused with the question of human rights in East Timor. That matter is the subject of some deliberation by that court, and I will not go into it in any detail. Suffice it to say that Australia is only setting out to use those resources which are legally hers. The case put by Australia is a sound one, and I would commend to senators the case, as put forward by Michael Tate and others, as a means of ascertaining our position in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Madam Acting Deputy President, this is a problem which will not go away overnight. It will require our constant attention and our constant monitoring of the situation. I would urge all senators to participate in the debate on this matter, and to participate in resolutions in relation to this matter. I would encourage the Senate and any of its committees which have any terms of reference which might touch on this to push for some sort of exchange visit with East Timor. I believe that it is only by maintaining pressure from this chamber that we will see a solution to this problem which is internationally acceptable. </PARA>

Like any group in society, older people's sense of self is socially constructed, so society's attitude to growing older has an effect on how older people feel about themselves. Positive stereotypes can play a significant and important role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether my colleagues here are aware of the successful ageing project which took place in the ACT. It was a project which focused on what older people themselves identified as the social and physical conditions that enhanced the process of growing older. Let me quote from the evaluation report of that project:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those interviewed repeatedly identified the need for widespread acceptance of older people as a population continuing to have resources to offer the community. This was seen as a social condition enabling people to successfully age. It was felt that as long as people feel they are valued by the community they in turn value themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on the report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acceptance of this age group as capable and valuable members of the community was seen as essential to the `successful ageing' of the community . . . It is particularly important for policy makers and service providers alike to set about to change not only their own perceptions of the group aged 60 years and older but also to change the prevailing image in the wider population, including many of those already considered elderly.</PARA>
<PARA>Older Australians are too often portrayed and treated stereotypically as dependent, frail and unwell, inflexible and unable to accept change, passive, unproductive, mentally deteriorating and eventually needing institutionalisation. They are depicted by many as an inconvenient, slightly conscience-prodding minority who have little to do with the young vigorous majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These stereotypes have been perpetuated in language, government policy documents, professional literature and particularly in the media. In the 1990s they are still being perpetuated&mdash;I have given such an example today in that children's book. On television, if older people appear at all, they tend to be depicted as more comical, stubborn, eccentric and foolish than other characters. They are also more likely to be treated with disrespect. The negative images surrounding ageing are bound up with fear, outdated stereotypes and alarmist projections about the implications of an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to study the images of the elderly that are presented in our literature and the media and to ask whether these images are appropriate, accurate portrayals of older people in our society. The fact is they are not. These stereotypes do not reflect the reality of older people. They are grossly incorrect for the vast majority of older people. They demean and devalue them. The reality is that increasingly the aged are active, independent, healthy and involved people who contribute much to the economic, social and cultural life of Australia. The reality is that more than 60 per cent of the over-65 population have no limit to their functional ability. An additional 30 per cent report only some minor restrictions to their activity. Only 2.5 per cent of Australians over 60 live in nursing homes while 1.7 per cent live in hostels. Of those over 85, only 20 per cent live in nursing homes and 13.2 per cent live in hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most older people are leading active lives out in the community. Let me give an example of just how incorrect negative stereotypes are. Older Australians are frequently portrayed as dependent. Rarely emphasised are the figures that show how centrally involved our elders are in supporting other people. Hal Kendig's study of the aged in 1983 found that older people were more likely to be providers than recipients of many kinds of support. They are twice as likely to give financial assistance to their families than the reverse and they contribute enormously to families and the community through child minding and as volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people are also the pivot for much of the continuity of family culture and, as such, their position in our society should be valued and acknowledged. Older citizens are individuals who cannot and should not be lumped into one category of physically, socially and mentally impaired people. They are not an homogenous group with static needs but are a diverse and dynamic group. They come from a wide variety of cultural, educational and professional backgrounds with very different financial circumstances, physical capabilities, lifestyles, opinions and expectations. They range from the very active involved to the older frail aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ageing is not an illness; it is a description of the life cycle itself. As a society we need to change our attitude to ageing and think again about the intrinsic value of life's many stages: from infancy to childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age and old, old age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia grows older in the latter part of this century and even more into the next century, the majority of us can look forward to a fit, productive old age. In fact, future generations of older Australians are likely to be the best educated, best fed, best housed, healthiest and most active generation of Australians ever to have reached their sixth decile. Old age promises to be a rich resource for our society; but only if it is accompanied by wise and appropriate policies and by a shift in attitude away from the negative images that consign older people to the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time as legislators that all of us here, members and senators, ensure that outmoded images of ageing and the aged are broken down. Today I have given just one example of a very outmoded and totally inappropriate representation of older people. Those outmoded images should be broken down and the public and policy makers should be educated to understand that the years after 65 are overwhelmingly a time of wellness, achievement and opportunity. What we need is a revolution against ageism. We have seen revolutions against sexism and against racism. Now we need to make sure that older people in our community are not ridiculed or treated with disrespect. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, a number of things need to be understood about the idea of a people's constitutional convention. In the first place&mdash;this may come as news to the opposition&mdash;the 1990s are not the 1890s. It is true that an elected people's convention was a key part of the federal constitutional decision making process in the 1890s but the circumstances are very different now from then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, there was no Australian nation. Then, there was no Australian constitution. Then, there was no established process to debate the making or the amendment of the national constitution. Then, there was no established process for initiating constitutional change. Then, there was no established process for adopting constitutional change. In that context, the establishment of a people's convention was necessary to give a kick-start to the whole process: to create a body which could decide upon the constitutional text, to decide upon a method of putting it to the people, and to trigger the whole adoption process into action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast 100 years later, in the 1990s, we have an Australian nation, we have an Australian constitution, we have an established representative process for debating and initiating constitutional change, namely, the national parliament, we have an established process for adopting constitutional change, namely, the referendum process laid out in the text of the constitution itself. So we do not need an elected convention or any kind of formal new body as part of the decision making process, whether it is about the republic or anything else, in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second place, it is not at all clear what value a people's convention would add to the consultative process. We do need, just as we did in the 1890s, a proper consultative process to ensure that the Australian people are well informed about the constitutional proposals put to them and also to ensure that the parliament itself, before putting proposals forward, has systematic input from the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A people's convention means&mdash;although the opposition does not tell us&mdash;a fully elected convention, otherwise it would be just another conference like the one we had in the Old Parliament House a few weeks ago, or just another gathering of parliamentary representatives, as we have had six times, without conspicuous success, over the period from 1973 to 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if you had such an elected convention, it would be extremely expensive to put together&mdash;something like $40 million to elect it&mdash;and, at the end of that process, it would not necessarily be any more representative or any more responsive to public opinion than this particular parliament and it would not of itself have the capacity to actually require any proposals to be put to referendum. The most it could do would be to request or advise this parliament to do so. This is the basic point: the idea of a people's convention may or may not add some value to the consultative process but we do have real doubts on this side of the parliament&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his statement of 22 December 1994 which Senator Bell referred to, the Prime Minister made it clear that the maximum permissible level of woodchips for export for 1996 would be five million tonnes except in relation to areas where there has been significant progress towards a regional forest agreement or the completion of such an RFA. I am advised that, so as not to foreclose options for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system to be developed as part of the RFA process, the Commonwealth will be conducting a preliminary assessment of areas that may be required for the reserve system. Licences will not be granted for woodchips sourced from those areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a supplementary question. The time scale is a little worrying. This concept of scoping is one we have heard before. It seemed to be an excuse for not actually getting on with it. If the government wants to issue export woodchip licences this year, it appears there has not been much progress so far. With regard to the Prime Minister's statement that the maximum permissible level for export would be five million tonnes, Mr Beddall's table of 1995 licences totals 5.655 million tonnes and 20 per cent of that leaves about 4.524 million tonnes. I really think that half a million tonnes should be seen as a significant amount. Which will be the final figure for the licences&mdash;4.524 million tonnes or five million tonnes?</PARA></TALK.START>

These assumptions are highly questionable.  While it is claimed by the Industry Commission that compulsory competitive tendering is supposed to yield cost savings of 20 per cent, the United Kingdom, which has been doing this, estimates the yield as six per cent without including the costs of monitoring.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is no. I think it is important to look exactly at what the Industry Commission was asked to do in this case. The report was commissioned at the Darwin COAG in August 1994 at the request of the states. The states wanted to know what were to be the likely revenue benefits to governments arising from the implementation of the Hilmer reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working in a tight time frame, the Industry Commission undertook a modelling exercise to estimate the revenue and broader economic benefits of competition policy and those related reforms. The Industry Commission used an outer envelope of reforms on which to base its estimates. In many cases these were reforms which were already being contemplated by governments; that is, reforms to electricity, gas and the water sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is not a blueprint for what governments will or should ultimately do in implementing the competition policy. But the commission, as you have said, estimated the economic benefits to be about 5.5 per cent of GDP&mdash;an increase in real consumption of $9 billion and around 30,000 more jobs. That is why I answered no to the last part of your question, Senator Margetts. It is expected to generate higher employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of debate about the size of benefits estimated by the Industry Commission, but few have argued that there will not be benefits to consumers and businessmen from the competition reforms. It is the case that benefits should be gauged not just in an economic sense but in the context of government's broader policy concerns. These include the environment, social policy, health and safety et cetera. It is the legitimate role of elected governments to assess the benefits and cost of policy action in the broader context. This is not the task which the Industry Commission proceeded with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, the competition policy agreement, signed by the Commonwealth and the states in April, includes a clear provision that any reforms be considered taking into account a range of other public interest matters&mdash;and they are ecologically sustainable development, industrial relations, community service obligations, occupational health and safety and like matters. The reforms are not about competition for the sake of competition but are placed clearly in the context of broader concerns. The figure estimated by the Industry Commission, using an outer envelope of estimates, is a 5.5 per cent increase in the level of GDP, an increase in real consumption of $9 billion, and the creation of around 30,000 extra jobs.</PARA>

Is it the case that, as a consequence of compulsory unionism and union affiliation with the ALP, the New South Wales Labor Party's rescue package proposal, which is a one dollar levy on each of the 700,000 trade unionists of all political complexions, will effectively be subsidised by the Commonwealth government to the tune of $224,000 because of the tax deductible status of union dues?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is proposed, as I understand it, in New South Wales is not a levy but an increased affiliation fee. It forms part of the larger mass of the affiliation fee paid by the unions. It is a familiar feature of our tax law, and has been for years, that for any form of business or professional or industrial association which involves the advancement of its members' interests, it is permissible for the fees to be the subject of a tax deduction. In that respect, trade unions are no different from any other business or professional associations which advance the interests of their members. There are multiple contexts in which those interests are advanced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that unions choose to spend a proportion of their affiliation fees from members on affiliating with the Labor Party is a perfectly understandable and legitimate decision for them, just as similar forms of expenditure decisions are made by other businesses and professional associations.

Given the 90 per cent deterioration to nearly $7.5 billion in Australia of the annual automotive trade deficit over the last three years, will the minister heed the call of the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers for an immediate freeze on further tariff reductions or, for that matter, will the government take any other measure to deal with this emergency?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pay a compliment to Senator Spindler. He is the only spokesperson for industry on the non-government side of this parliament who takes an interest in this issue. I do not think Mr John Moore, the shadow minister for industry and commerce, has ever asked a question on this subject. Senator Spindler, you are entitled to that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say that, as we have had this debate for a long time, I do not agree with Senator Spindler. Let me turn to some reasons. The 20 per cent that Senator Spindler referred to in terms of import penetration occurred in 1984. Do you remember what the car industry was like in 1984? We had high levels of tariff protection, high prices for domestic consumers, too many models on the road, very poor quality, and no exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have now? We have a lean, mean and a very competitive car industry. The level of imports is in the luxury car area and in the small car area; areas in which we do not make cars any more in Australia. But the family sedan that we do make in Australia beats the best that the world can throw at us. We hold our market share in terms of Australian production. It is a high quality car, cheaper in price, more efficiently produced, and claiming massive export dollars for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Riding along with it is the component parts industry. This industry is also going gang busters, to use a phrase that has gained some notoriety regarding manufacturing exporters. It picks up the statistics in a colourful way. But component car part manufacturing exports are going gang busters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would not have occurred had not the Button car plan been introduced and had we not phased down tariff protection in this country at a speed at which the industry is gradually exposed to international competition and becomes more internationally competitive itself. This has produced massive changes in the industry. In the old days the industry resisted some of these changes but it now sees how useful and important they were in making this a world competitive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of 50 per cent that Senator Spindler mentioned is the April 1995 figure. I understand that the actual figure was 50.22 per cent. That was a time at which a number of component parts manufacturers in Australia had industrial relations problems and there was an interruption of supply of componentry to the major big four. As a consequence, we produced less that month than we would otherwise have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date Senator Spindler has used is a date that does not reflect the true competitiveness of the industry. I do not accept the proposition that it will go to 65 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing about all this? We have been working very closely with the big four car manufacturers who are, I might add, the major importers of small cars in this country and who have benefited under the import credit scheme, thus becoming more effective exporters. We are working with the manufacturers to improve the industrial relations environment, to reduce costs at each stage of micro-economic reform, and to ensure that they become increasingly competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have signalled that we will examine the tariff regime beyond the year 2000. We will commence an examination of that next year so that the report can be undertaken and completed to give the car manufacturers of Australia a vision into the next century in terms of tariff levels. Importantly, under APEC, we are setting about opening up markets in this region which will allow the comparative advantage that Australian car manufacturers enjoy to penetrate more widely throughout this region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every country is entitled to take appropriate measures to protect its own security and intelligence service and operations. I would have thought that Senator MacGibbon, among all those in this place, would have a better understanding and more interest in that particular issue than most people. The truth of the matter is that the only likely, really effective, way of protecting those services and those operations is through preventive strategies, through having the kinds of management structures and processes in place that you do not create the kind of disgruntlement which leads to people breaching their obligations of confidentiality in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that so far as the media is concerned, where the most damaging publications and releases of information occur, it is wholly desirable to overwhelmingly place the emphasis on preventive strategies of one kind or another. The D-Notices were designed to do that. There has also been a tradition of reliance on the good faith and commitment of the media to this country's national interests and their willingness to understand the issues involved and to respond accordingly when approached by the government, as they were&mdash;although this has not been clearly acknowledged by them&mdash;in the context of the recent purported disclosures about recent events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that those preventive strategies fail, it is necessary for governments to have some additional weapons available to make clear the extent of the problems that are caused, the damage that is caused, to the national interest if disclosures of that kind take place. It is in that context and with the active agreement, cooperation and support of the opposition&mdash;through its foreign shadow spokesman, Alexander Downer, who agreed to every line of the proposals that I read out in the chamber in this respect&mdash;that we floated the possibility of some remedial legislation of that kind, going in some respects into a little different territory from that which had been occupied before, but in other respects not really advancing the process at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, of course&mdash;although this has again been lost in this great flurry of media debate&mdash;under the Crimes Act, sections 70 and 79, the disclosure of secret information was penalisable so far as the first instance disclosures are concerned. Under section 5&mdash;provisions relating to accomplices, those who aid, abet or somehow pursue that disclosure in other forums&mdash;that was punishable equally as with the primary offence. So there is nothing new in the law in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is lacking in the law as it stands at the moment, in sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act, is specificity in relation to those offences which are too broadly defined and in many ways overreaching in their impact. What we were floating, what Mr Downer was supporting me explicitly in floating&mdash;and if he has been left high and dry by his leader in this respect that is his and the opposition's problem; it was a matter of me acting in good faith&mdash;was a situation where there would in fact be a number of restrictions built in; namely, a requirement to prove damage in all cases which the Samuels inquiry had not recommended, plus the specific defences which had not previously been available in the criminal law of a public interest kind, namely, that proof of illegality was established in relation to the acts in question that would constitute a legitimate ground for defence against any such prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there was a careful balancing of all the issues that evolved in this. That was only a matter of proposed general principle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the statistics section of the Parliamentary Library, sales tax collections from the latest budget will represent the biggest proportion of gross domestic product in our history. Not only that: those collections from sales tax are about 50 per cent higher as a proportion of gross domestic product than when the coalition was last in government and have increased by about 25 per cent since the pre-1993 election budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government went into that election attacking not just the specifics but the whole concept of a consumption tax. It said, `We are opposed to consumption taxes. Consumption taxes are dreadful. They hit the low income earners.' And it went on with a whole lot of other rhetoric. That rhetoric was uncomplicatedly dishonest&mdash;it was crooked. Since that time this government has imposed the biggest ever rises in the consumption tax it calls a sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a question of whether this government is credible. We know it is not credible. There is no doubt about it: the government was elected on a basic lie. But what is disturbing is that when you confront someone like Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Treasurer, with the fact of a 52 per cent increase in sales tax since the last election, when you confront him with the fact that that represents $5 billion extra being ripped off consumers by a party which opposed a consumption tax, you get no credible answer. In fact, you get a total whitewash, a pretence that this has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard Senator Cook say, `You wanted to introduce a GST.' We now know what the secret government GST is&mdash;sales tax. Sales tax is the government's secret, hidden, sneaky, dishonest GST. It has raised an extra $5 billion since the last election campaign. And what is the government taxing? This government's sneaky, hidden sales tax is on soft drinks, biscuits, snack foods, ice cream, refrigerators, washing machines, toilet paper, wine, motor vehicles, furniture, toothbrushes, soaps, detergents, CDs, radios, record players and computers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are they the sorts of things that consumers do not buy? Not on your life: they are the very things that the battlers have to buy. They are things that are basic to an Australian standard of living. But they are the things that this government is taxing, taxing, taxing. And this sales tax&mdash;this hidden, sneaky government version of a GST, the one it did not tell us about at the election&mdash;is to be increased further on 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a clear situation where the government is blatantly dishonest. But it has been like that for years. The Treasurer, Mr Willis, who introduced these latest sales tax rises, said when he was in opposition that he was `implacably opposed to these measures because they represent a repudiation of a pledge not to broaden the indirect tax base.' It is amazing how you change your views when you go into government and become Treasurer! You then have no principles at all, as has been demonstrated by Mr Willis. When opposing sales tax rises, Mr Willis said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Colston this day, relating to resources devoted to activities of the Australian Customs Service in Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the greatest tragedies facing our society is the horrendous drug trade. It is an area of the criminal law over which the Commonwealth has direct responsibility. It is a very serious issue. That is why I am absolutely appalled at the very light note that Senator Schacht made of this very tragic issue in his answer at question time today and in the way that he has dealt with my complaints previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht makes light of my concern, says that I talk about people in red hats and that I should be able to identify people who are bringing drugs into our country through the Torres Strait from New Guinea. It seems to Senator Schacht and every one in the Labor government that, if you are out of sight, you are out of mind. If it does not happen in Canberra, Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne, they do not care about it. The Torres Strait, in case Senator Schacht does not know, is part of Australia. People up there are entitled to the same protection from this horrendous, tragic trade as are other Australians. Yet Senator Schacht says, `We have plenty of people up there looking after it.' They have eight customs officers out of almost 4,000 customs officers in Australia. I do not think&mdash;and neither do the people of Torres Strait&mdash;that eight officers out of 4,000 is adequate protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not expect Senator Schacht to take any notice of what anyone on this side says because he is an old Labor Party hack. He is in here for the politics; he is not concerned with running the country properly. But I ask him to take some notice, as I pleaded with him at estimates committees, of local community leaders in the Torres Strait. Island community leaders are appalled and are in fear of their lives over the drug trade. Senator Schacht may say that he has attended a conference in Brisbane and that there is no evidence of it, but I ask him to listen to what the island leaders say in the Torres Strait. As quoted on page 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> on 13 May 1995, Mr Wais, the head of the Saibai Island community and the acting chairman of the Island Coordinating Council, said it was crucial that Islanders and the government do something about this horrendous trade. Mr Wais said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to understand. It is life-threatening to councillors and community people trying to put a stop to this because those involved will do anything to stop their identities leaking out . . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait is a very small place and, to play it safe, we need to join forces and establish who is doing this dirty stuff. I'm afraid someone is going to get killed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This island leader and Mr George Mye, a very respected community leader from Darnley Island, have pleaded with the government to set up some checking stations. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said checking stations should be established on each of the islands closest to PNG so dinghies carrying traditional visitors could be cleared of drugs and other health and quarantine goods before proceeding any further.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that Senator Schacht is not concerned about this. It would almost seem that the Labor Party is soft when it comes to drugs and the importation of drugs. This is a very serious matter and one which needs more than Senator Schacht's dismissive and almost comical comments on the particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people in the area who know what is happening. Anyone up there who has been around understands that there is illicit trade coming through. But the people themselves are concerned to do anything about it because they fear for their lives. We do need a greater Commonwealth presence there, whether it be from the Federal Police or more customs officers, but something does need to be done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to questions without notice asked by Senators Short and Baume this day, relating to taxation measures in the 1994-95 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the chamber of the question asked by Senator Short. He asked: could the minister inform the people of Australia what higher and new taxes will come into effect on 1 July 1995 and how much extra tax revenue the people of Australia will be paying next year as a direct result? In his answer to Senator Short, in his typical fashion, Senator Cook said, `I am not your researcher; you go and research it for yourself.' He replied in this way instead of addressing the question, coming clean with the Australian people and letting them know precisely what the government has done in relation to taxation this year as a result of the impact of this budget and impacts that it put in place in previous budgets, going back to the Dawkins budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have done the research; so I thought I might help out Senator Cook and give some answers relating to the amount of tax that has been increased. It is quite staggering, as Senator Short noted in his supplementary question. There is an additional $14 billion worth of tax being taken this financial year. When we add to that the company tax, that goes up to $17 billion. It is very instructive to look at the budget papers. We find with customs there is another $110 million. There is almost $1 billion&mdash;$952,284 million&mdash;of extra excise. Most of that is from fuel. Most of the tax is on the tyranny of distance and very little of it&mdash;in fact, 2.4 per cent of the 7.7 per cent&mdash;goes back into road funding. It is no wonder that the roads in rural and regional Australia and many of our city highways are in serious need of additional money and additional work because of the misuse of the fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax brings in another $2.58 billion. The real killer of this budget and the measures which have been put in place by this government is the PAYE tax. We find that the tax take this financial year increased by $6.1 billion. Almost 40 per cent of the total increase of taxation comes out of the pockets of PAYE taxpayers. Yet this government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have the audacity to stand up here and say that they have not increased taxes. The increased tax take is one of the largest increases in one budget in the history of this nation. In round figures it went from $103 billion to $117 billion. In relation to other individuals, the figure is $1.3 billion; the increase in company tax is $2.9 billion; dividend interest and withholding taxes is $90 million; prescribed payments is $160 million; superannuation is $250 million; resource rent tax is $70 million; and fringe benefits tax is $120 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, tied up in all of this is the impact of what has occurred by way of sales tax increases. I refer to the additional increases on everyday requirements to do with housing&mdash;bathroom, kitchen and laundry items. We heard a little about that yesterday. The impact will be up to $2,000 or thereabouts per house. An average family with two or three children is looking at an increase of well over $1,000 in the cost of a new house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we go through these items and note the lack of response by Senator Cook and the government to these points, it is worth pointing out to the Australian public that this is one of the great taxing budgets of all time. On top of that we find that the government has only addressed the fiscal deficit by $3 billion. The rest of it is a con in terms of asset sales. As most people in this place would know, I am a farmer. If you start selling the assets needed to run your farm, you soon go out of business. It does not work. If you lease your family car, you suddenly find out that you do not have a motor car. As we look at everything that has been done in this budget we find that it is very irresponsible in terms of how one runs a business. As far as the fiscal operations of this country are concerned, it is about time this government looked at running Australia as a business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in the Hunter Valley at this time one small business going broke every day. The sorts of businesses that are affected are small family businesses, often employing only two or three people. These jobs are really the backbone of our economy&mdash;48 per cent of employment in our country comes from the small business sector. I refer to this federal government's lack of action and the fact that Senator Schacht got up yet again today, washing his hands like Pontius Pilate and saying, `Well, it's not really my affair. I can't really fix it at the federal level. It's really a state and local government matter.' He is right; it is a state and local government matter. But where he is wrong is that it is very much a federal government matter. The federal government has the capacity to use powers that it has and it has a capacity through legislation to increase the powers that it has but it chooses not to do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht was not going to come to the rally either after writing that dismissive letter. Today he gets up and claims that he went there. Let me tell you that, two days before the rally, he was not going. I was talking to the organisers and he was not coming. Suddenly, when our small business spokesperson flew from the other side of Australia to go, he was there. The reason was that the Prime Minister told him to get himself up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a reception he got! It was a very cool reception. Judi Moylan made an excellent speech. When we spoke, we got quite a lot of cheers and claps. When Senator Schacht got up, he was greeted with a stony silence. The reason for that is that small business people know what the problem is; they know where the problem lies. It lies at the federal level. It is very easy to get assistance at the local government level. If you put the right pressure on, you can get the zonings changed. As the lord mayor pointed out, the small business people did not put on enough pressure in the suburb of Mayfield where a new supermarket has started. They have learnt that lesson. That will happen in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, action can be taken at the state government level, and you do not need a change of legislation to fix it&mdash;it is already in the legislation.

There is one small business a day going broke in the Hunter, Senator Schacht. How long can they afford to wait for you to come up with some answer?

<PARA>The question asked by Senator Woods was a very proper and reasonable question. It is to be noted that it was the second occasion on which Senator Woods asked this question.

Trade union membership is tax deductible. In effect, you can then launder money out of the trade union movement for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party at the expense of the taxpayer. If we on this side of the Senate ran a business deal like that and then sought to levy our members, we would not get tax deductibility for a building fund. We would get tax deductibility of up to $100 of a membership fee. But the vast majority of trade union membership fees are in excess of $100.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's debate brings into question the living standards of families as they have been affected by the present Labor government. I ask honourable senators to think back to the position of families in 1983. While we should always look forward rather than backwards, I think a consideration of families in that year would provide a very different picture of their position as compared to today. Before I am accused by government senators of taking a rosy backward glance, I want to be the first to admit that there would have been a degree of unemployment in 1983 but, by comparison, youth homelessness would have been a very rare phenomenon and families looked out on a far more secure and settled life than they do today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the features of the social dislocation which has occurred under this Labor government? For a start, more Australians than ever before are dependent on government benefits for their income and survival. Between 1983 and 1993 an additional 666,000 people collected the age pension, unemployment benefits, the disability pension or the sole parent pension. The disparity between rich and poor has widened dramatically and it is getting far more difficult for those at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale to even think of attaining levels of income or wealth that were feasible 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an egalitarian society everyone should be able to aspire to a job that pays them a decent income and those who want to work should be able to work. Under the Labor government this has been taken away. The present government has had the audacity to print copies of a piece entitled `Agenda for families' which came out with this year's budget. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest help a government can give to families is a strong economy . . . Nothing helps families more than employment and . . . decent wages and the opportunity for . . . advancement.</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia in November 1983 real total average weekly earnings in today's prices were $545 compared to $543 in February this year. After 12 years of Labor government, real average wages have fallen under a government that pretends to look after the working man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, comparing net incomes in Australia to those in America, the wages of a builder's labourer are 99 per cent higher in Los Angeles than they are in Sydney. The hypocrisy of this government to assert the importance of a strong economy! Household debt was 42 per cent of disposable income in 1983 and it is currently 66 per cent of household disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On any indicator, indeed, moving from the macro-economic indicator of foreign debt or the current account deficit to the micro-economic indicator of household savings, this government has wasted its opportunities. Households have accumulated as much debt in the last five years as they did in the previous 10 years. Again, there is no incentive for families to save and savings are taxed at every turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more, actions taken by the government in this year's budget forcing families to fork out yet more in taxes will create greater hardship for the average Australian family. The tax take in this year's budget increased 9.3 per cent in real terms and individual tax will have increased by 136.8 per cent since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families are going to pay more for cars. They are going to pay more for sales tax. They are going to pay more for cigarettes. They are going to pay more for the building materials that they use to try to build their new home. And the 12 per cent sales tax that has been imposed on building materials will add something like $2,500 to the cost of a new home. So much for the great Australian dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme general safety net widened from $407 to $600&mdash;an incredible anti-family measure. According to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, this budget in its entirety will result in 13 per cent of families being worse off by an average of $7.60 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his usual generous way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would probably tell you that $7.60 will make no real difference to a family. Let me tell you that a family which budgets dollar for dollar on its average or usual family weekly income needs every dollar it can get. And any lessening of that actual dollar amount will mean that they have to look at where they can save the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, child care is another area where the government has made extravagant promises and failed to come through. And, again in this budget, we have seen cuts to family day care and an increase in the minimum eligibility for fee relief. Families in which one parent is at home caring for children will be hurt by having their formal care cut to 12 hours per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has done nothing for equity or accessibility to child care. Talking about inequality and inaccessibility leads me to refer to a recent EPAC report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income distribution in Australia: recent trends in research</EMPHASIS>. This shows that the real earnings of Australian workers at the bottom of the income distribution ladder are now also at a lower level than they were under Malcolm Fraser's prime ministership, and the gap between those workers and those at the top end of income distribution has widened by almost 20 per cent under Labor and by 10 per cent in the past four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inequality, high levels of unemployment and low incomes have associated social costs which are reflected in huge health costs. Again, we have increasing levels of youth suicide as well as the actual wellbeing of people. It is a dramatic indictment of an Australian society where youth has no more hope than to take a decision to end one's own life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, area by area from a geographic point of view, no more equality has been achieved. I would like to refer to some of the employment statistics in my own area of Victoria. For instance, teenage unemployment in Victorian areas runs at something like 51.9 per cent in north-western Melbourne and 70.8 per cent in inner Melbourne. And, to give you an idea of the extent of the problem in rural areas, the Loddon-Campaspe-Mallee areas have a teenage unemployment rate of 44.1 per cent and the Barwon-western areas which run from Geelong to the South Australian border&mdash;my own area&mdash;have a teenage unemployment rate of 39.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans, in his response to my question on 31 May, talked about absolutely spectacular jobs growth and the down trending of the unemployment rate. I would like him to talk to those 70.8 per cent of unemployed inner Melbourne teenagers about this spectacular jobs growth to see what their response is. What are some of the reasons for this very high unemployment level? One reason would certainly be this government's draconian industrial relations legislation. The ability of employers to take on staff is constrained by unfair dismissal laws which make it extraordinarily difficulty for employers to lay off unsatisfactory staff. This results in a reluctance to take on new staff. There is 30 per cent to 50 per cent more in on-costs associated with employing staff, plus the amount of regulatory paper work required. Why would anyone want to take on new staff? Unfortunately, this impacts on families whose members are put out of work or retrenched. There are other impacts that we are discussing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Choice has narrowed considerably over the last 12 years for Australian families. They are forced to operate within a much more constrained set of choices for jobs, family arrangements, hours of employment and conditions of employment. There has never been more money spent in Australia on social problems than there is today. I am sure that senators opposite will tell us about program after program invented by the government. But all the problems I have mentioned are growing, not diminishing, which is why the coalition believes that Labor has neglected Australian families. </PARA>

They will say to you, `Rhubarb. We are very pleased with what the government has done for families. We are very pleased that it has an agenda.' We have a government agenda, coming out of the budget, committing us to the family in a way that is more coherent and brings together all the things that we have been doing for families since we got elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we have done for families is establish Medicare. So successful is it that we now have your endorsement of it. Families in Australia really welcome it. Two million people were uninsured before we came into office. Now everyone is covered by Medicare. None of them have to worry about whether they can afford the bills when they go to the doctor. Is that family friendly? Of course, it is. Who did it? It was this Labor government; because we care about families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have provided a massive increase in funding for education for the sons and daughters of Australian families. About 37 per cent continued to year 12 when we came to office but it is around 80 per cent now, higher in some places. That is what we have done in education. When students have completed year 12 at school, most&mdash;and a significantly increasing number&mdash;of those students now have the opportunity of tertiary places at universities, TAFE colleges and other institutions of post-secondary learning. Thousands of youngsters are taking up those opportunities because they appreciate that the way to best have an opportunity in this new society&mdash;dramatically changed by a federal Labor government&mdash;is to exercise their opportunity for education so they can best participate in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for these educational opportunities to be picked up by youngsters and people of all ages in Australia. We have seen a huge change in education flexibility brought about by this government. Families love it on behalf of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth also suggests that we have falling living standards. Let me refer to an excellent article by Deborah Hope in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 3 June 1995. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Travers and Richardson, the living standards of the present have never been equalled in Australia. `This is true whether we look at real purchasing power per person . . . at standards of housing and extent of education, at the quality of medicine, the extent of support of people who have few resources of their own and at equality of opportunity'. Our social security benefits are well above the OECD average. Since the thirties, home ownership has grown from 55 to 73 per cent, and Australia has one of the highest life expectancy rates in the world. From the prosperous early seventies, real GDP per head has risen by 50 per cent, and Australia is ranked seventh on the United Nations human development index for industrial countries on literacy, longevity and per capita GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>It just depends on which piece of paper Senator Troeth wants to produce to convince Australians of her doom and gloom measure. After all, why on earth would people otherwise think of Mr Howard? He has nothing to offer at all. This government has something to offer and has made things so much better for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth mentions family breakdown and the terrible social cost of all these things that are going on in our society. The International Year of the Family gave us some hard data instead of Senator Troeth's myths about the family. What do we find? The family is not in crisis; the family is not finished; the family is not at risk of extinction; it is here to stay. Over 91 per cent of people think that the family is the most important thing in their lives. People are very pleased with the support they receive from their families. In return, they want to go on providing support for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About four million family households&mdash;86 per cent of the total&mdash;are couple families: 92 per cent of these are a registered marriage; and 50 per cent of all marriages last around 30 years, or until one partner dies. Ninety five per cent of couples with children are married. Within five years of the previous marriage ending, 69 per cent of men and 65 per cent of women have remarried. That is another set of myths that needs to be set aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that 79 per cent of children live with both their natural parents until the children are in their twenties; six per cent live in a blended two parent family; 15 per cent live in a sole parent family. Only three per cent of sole parent families have teenagers, and six per cent of sole parent families are headed by men. I hope Senator Troeth will ring her colleague in South Australia, Mr Rossi, and remind him of these facts about families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all that it has been challenged and is undergoing change, the family is doing very well. The family has been assisted very dramatically by this government through its commitment to families. We have the specific family agenda that brings together a number of items that were previously separated. People might not have put health and education together as one package for families. I certainly do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family agenda certainly increases that commitment when we consider the great maternity benefit and increased child-care arrangements, about which Senator Troeth was very disparaging. Senator Troeth could list only a few negatives that she saw in the child-care area. We have had a dramatic increase in child-care places and a dramatic increase in family day care opportunities. A huge number of people, particularly women, are either participating in the work force, studying or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government gave us educational opportunities and child care which allowed people to take advantage of these things. We have gone from 46,000 places to over 260,000 places in child care, and all of those are very affordable because of the child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate. I understand that those opposite, in a moment of weakness, said that they will make accreditation voluntary and do away with the requirement of quality in child care. All the assurance we have been able to give parents will be undone by Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish by picking up on a point that you made, Senator Troeth, that the working man in this country could take no comfort from life under Labor. You are wrong on those facts anyhow, but this government does not concern itself or restrict itself to the working man; we are concerned about the working woman too. We are concerned about women and we do not put policies for women only under the heading of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard put out a headland statement yesterday. It may be a headland statement, but it has nothing to say about non-English speaking background families, nothing at all, and nothing to say about women, except that they might be part of a family. This is from Mr Howard, who says that he has been liberated about families&mdash;and he was quoted as saying that, I believe, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> early this year. He might be liberated about families, but he still has a policy document that says nothing about women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, Senator, talk about the working man. What a pity! Perhaps it is because you have not come up to 1983. In the last 12 years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of women participating in the work force. We talk about working people in this country and the opportunities they have under Labor. Under this Labor government there are opportunities for those families that have made such a difference to the quality of their lives and the things that they now entertain for themselves and for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would you want to have a headland document that misses out on women altogether? We know that the changes for women make such a difference to the families in this country. To have a woman who is confident and assured as part of a family is to improve on what life was like in the past for families in which women did not have educational or employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do have opportunities under this Labor government. It has enormously assisted families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic we are debating today expresses concern about the impact of falling living standards, high unemployment and associated family breakdown and other social costs. It is implicit in this topic that it is essential there be an adequate system of welfare to assist and empower families that are under economic or social pressure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When cold economic reasoning becomes the main justification for policy making, compassion and caring are very much discounted. This is highlighted by the dismantling and tightening of the welfare system. If we acknowledge the difficulties faced by Australian families, it must be recognised that these difficulties apply all the more to those people who live in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I visited Mount Isa, Longreach, Winton and Cloncurry in north-west Queensland&mdash;an area that I lived in for five years in the late 1960s. While I was there I met with people from the Remote Area Families Service in Mount Isa, who work regularly with families throughout the north-west area of Queensland. The stories which these people tell highlight the extra difficulties faced by people in remote areas. It is in these regions that government neglect is obvious. Economic problems are more pronounced in many rural areas, adding to the problems of isolation and distance, and there are substantially fewer health services and other services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could give you statistics but it might be useful if I illustrated this point with the human face described to me by the Aged Care Service and Remote Area Family Service in Mount Isa. Those services spoke about the problem in many country hospitals of the government limiting such things as long-term beds. At Julia Creek, for instance, there is one long-term bed allowed, which is always full, while 14 other beds in that hospital remain empty. Recently, a woman in her 80s was sent to the Julia Creek hospital. The long-term bed was full so she had to go over 1,000 kilometres to Brisbane, where she died six weeks later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are gaps in our system and I urge both the government and the coalition to take account of them. In remote areas there is a great need for the education of children&mdash;a greater need for those on properties than for those in towns. We need to differentiate between rural and remote rural areas. For example, one of the problems faced by many people on remote properties is teaching their children. They need incentives. But there is no child-care funding or tax concessions for people who employ governesses. There is no credit given to graduate teachers who, being unable to get a job anywhere else, offer to do governessing for a period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between quantitative and qualitative care, which is often blurred by statistical support for submissions, is a problem that needs to be drawn to the attention of all. For example, a ridiculous situation exists whereby, to identify categories in statistical returns, postcodes are often used. There are properties in the Northern Territory which receive mail through Mount Isa. In statistical returns, the Mount Isa postcode is used while the properties themselves are hundreds of kilometres from Mount Isa. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

True, the individuals and families affected may not starve or suffer from lack of health facilities but they too frequently feel that nobody is concerned about them. Loneliness, isolation, and loss of self-esteem can be corrosive of the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If human potential is to be realised, we need to develop self-motivating people, strongly bonded in their family groups, with eagerness and initiative to strive, and with the opportunities to put their talents to successful enterprises. It is, of course, the duty of government to offer adequate assistance to the underprivileged and the aged poor; the nature of that government support should be such as to preserve dignity in the recipient. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The post-war era saw several decades in which Liberal governments sought to strengthen families with full employment, low inflation, and home ownership. As the government said in its agenda for families, the greatest help a government can give to families is a strong economy&mdash;that is from the government's own budget papers. Sadly, of course, by those criteria, the government has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were the decades, in the post-war era, when families did flourish and where the forgotten people were recognised. Today, many single parent families are suffering great hardships with great strain on both parents and children. Many of the newly developed suburbs, particularly in the south and south-west of Sydney, lack community facilities capable of bringing diverse backgrounds and languages together. The result is that loneliness and isolation are manifest. The many chronically unemployed transients, seeking employment or sometimes warmer climates and cheaper living conditions on the central and north coasts of New South Wales, are witness to this trend. Some schools in those areas face the challenge of almost 30 per cent transience in enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that this government sees its economic theories and policies as goals in themselves and has forgotten that economics, at its best, is an imperfect mechanism.

A genuine concern for people should be the focus of our debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian family is to be strengthened, if the problems of the low income and single parent families are to be minimised, if the elements of family dysfunction are to be identified and mitigated, the first duty of government is to restore the family as a viable economic and social unit, confident and secure in its future. By these criteria, it is very clear that this government has failed. </PARA>

Now, $8 might be dismissed by the government as being of no significance but, as my colleague Senator Troeth mentioned, $8 to a family which is counting every dollar is a lot of money. </PARA>

The family is no longer at risk of extinction&mdash;no words about nurturing, no words about support, no words about encouraging and strengthening&mdash;it is not at risk of extinction.

I point out that 60 per cent of 13- to 16-year-old students from low income families do not have literacy levels beyond the fourth grade. That is primary school literacy levels. This is something the government should be ashamed of. The government should be supporting families, not mouthing empty promises and rhetoric. It should get out there and make sure that the cornerstone of our society is truly strengthened. </PARA>

There is also housing services and payments of cash support, but those opposite can only see the cash support. They fail to look at the assistance given through Medicare. The majority of people in Australia like Medicare and bulkbilling. However, the opposition failed to appreciate that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of Australian social trends backs this up, showing greater income in equality, rising welfare dependency, greater family breakdown, the emergence of a working poor and an alarming surge in the suicide rate, particularly amongst young men. We talk about high unemployment; unemployment is currently running at 8.3 per cent, seasonally adjusted in April. This figure is alarming in itself. But we have to look at what is happening with government programs. The government is shifting people off unemployment benefits. Older people who are unable to get unemployment are being shifted to a mature age allowance. This government is fudging those unemployment figures and fudging the impact on Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the impact of unemployment on young people who are unemployed. Senator Troeth gave some examples of unemployment in rural areas in Victoria. She mentioned two in particular and I mentioned two others: the central highlands and the Wimmera area where unemployment is running at 31.8 per cent for young people; and the Gulbert-Ovens-Murray zone area where the unemployment rate is 36.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment affects young Australian families across the board. A while ago I had a phone call to my office from a grandparent desperate because her grandchild could not get a job. It does not just worry their parents; their grandparents also worry when they see that number of young people&mdash;40 or 45 per cent of young people in rural areas&mdash;unable to find a job. Senator Crowley was saying that the situation is good. That is the sort of statement that Mr Keating made to small business. Senator Crowley was telling us, `It doesn't get much better than this; you've never had it so good.' She has not even stayed for the debate. Australian families know that that is not the case. They have been hit by the previous policies of this government and they have also been hit by the current budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spend more on family breakdown than we spend on  keeping families together. If we look at the budget we spent on the Family Court and the Child Support Agency we see that we have spent millions and millions of dollars shutting the door after the horse has bolted. In 12 years this government has done almost nothing about families before they reach crisis point. One of the reasons which causes crisis in families is financial stress. In the recession that we had to have we saw families facing enormous financial stress with those rising interest rates. Those families are now the ones who are appearing in the family courts. That is the legacy of this government's policy&mdash;family breakdown. What else is a legacy of family breakdown? There has been an increase in the number of young people on the streets. In six years the number of homeless young people has doubled. That is the legacy of this government's policies. That is the legacy of the breakdown in families in Australia today. Those opposite stand in here supposedly proud of their record. I would be appalled and ashamed of the record if I were in their shoes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this budget done for families? Senator Crowley got up and talked about the maternity allowance. The maternity allowance is a broken promise of Mr Keating's. He promised payment for 12 weeks at jobsearch allowance rates and a payment of at least $1,800, double what he is actually giving out. The basic family payment for 16- to 17-year-olds is to be paid through Austudy instead of the family payments scheme. That does not tell people that families will lose a total of $64.20 a year as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measure after measure in this budget hits families. Mr Howard told us we would not need an increase in the Medicare levy. Do honourable senators know why we have an increase in the Medicare levy? It is because Mr Keating wanted Senator Crowley's vote and she was not happy with the co-payment. Mr Howard said that without a co-payment the Medicare levy would not have to go up. So in order to get Senator Crowley's vote, Mr Keating bought that. This is the price Australians are paying in this budget for Mr Keating being in government&mdash;an increase in the Medicare levy. How does that affect families?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to acknowledge that the government has taken some positive measures to assist low income families. Unfortunately, this has been at the expense of middle income families. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should really look at that. The taxation of families is of concern to most Australians. After the budget I issued a press statement pointing out that a one income family with two children on average weekly earnings is at least $26.77 worse off than they were in December 1982. The government has circulated a note, prepared by the Department of Social Security, which disputes that figure and says that my example was selected for maximum effect. The example I gave was not extreme. In fact, using the same methodology, between December 1982 and December 1984 a one income family with a spouse and four children has actually lost $37 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social Security also wrongly asserts that my figures were misleading because the level of rebates claimed for 1982 was too high. It wrongly used the `without child' level of spouse rebate, which was extraordinary. The extraordinary thing is that Social Security admits that there have been tax increases from 1982 to 1994, even on its own figures. It admits that family disposable income will fall in the year to December 1995. It is no consolation for any family to be told that although the government is taking a larger slice of the tax packet, it is still leaving enough not to make families worse off than they were in December 1982. The percentage increase in tax is still outstripping the percentage increase in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Social Security's approach, the government could argue that as long as disposable income of a family was at the same level as it was in 1901, there has been no real increase in taxation since 1901. It is not even true that the government is still leaving people better off. There is no genuine increase in disposable family income. Social Security has ignored employee taxes not reflected in the CPI. Fringe benefits tax and tax on superannuation amounted to $15.26 per week per worker in 1994-95. This alone cancels out the suggested gain in disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most extravagant claim was the Prime Minister's assertion that the best&mdash;this was made earlier this week&mdash;measure of living standards in Australia is real household disposable income and that between 1983 and 1995 real household disposable income grew by 40 per cent. However, the Prime Minister admitted this figure to be irrelevant as soon as he said it and said that because the population has grown since then, it is more relevant to look at the numbers per head. He then argued that the disposable income per head compared with the March quarter of 1983 had increased 19.8 per cent. This figure is equally nonsense as it failed to adjust for increased working hours by primary breadwinners, increased reliance by families on a second breadwinner and a smaller number of children per household. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people would be amazed to be told that if they work a 48-hour week instead of a 40-hour week and get 20 per cent more income, they are 20 per cent better off. That would only be true if you attach no value at all to sport, rest, worship or to be with your spouse and family. Most people find that working longer hours puts considerably more stress on families, personal relationships and their quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if family disposable income did increase by $12.55 per week, that gain would have been purchased by full-time employees working longer hours. They are working harder than ever to defend their families' living standards. ABS statistics show that full-time workers are now working an average of 43 hours per week rather than 38.2 in 1982. A bogus 2.8 per cent increase in disposable income will have been gained since 1982 at the expense of a 12.6 per cent increase in working hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody knows that families are working harder and harder to pay more and more direct and indirect taxation to the government for less and less.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is stated that "as Medicare did not operate in 1982 and average workers needed to rely on private health insurance, inclusion of an estimate for private health insurance payments for that year would provide a fairer comparison".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any comparison for the 37.2% (June 1994) of the population that has retained hospital insurance would show a far worse result. This is especially so because hospital insurance premiums have gone up in real cost because of:-</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the abolition of the Commonwealth subsidy to the hospital benefits re-insurance trust account:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the abolition of the Commonwealth subsidy to private hospital beds; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the abolition of the tax rebate for health insurance premiums (in 1982-83 a rebate of 30.67% was available for payments to a registered health insurance organisation).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government abolished the general concessional rebate for family-type expenses over $1,590, under which many, if not most, families would have been able to claim a 30.67% tax rebate on "out of pocket" medical, dental, chemist or hospital expenses. Because the general concessional rebate included superannuation, life assurance premiums and rates, many family taxpayers would have been able to claim the 30.67% rebate on almost their first dollar of health, dental, chemist or hospital "out of pocket" expenses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more limited medical expenses rebate now excludes the first $1,000 of medical and hospital expenses and applies a reduced tax rebate of 20%. Contributions paid to medical or hospital benefits funds or to other health insurance funds do not qualify for this tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this respect the comparison has been excessively kind to the Government's record. In 1983 in Victoria family HBA basic hospital contributions were $8.80 per week ($6.10 after the 30.67% tax rebate). In June 1995, they are $16.40 per week and there is no tax rebate. In Victoria HBA top hospital family cover in September 1983 was $13.50 per week ($9.36 after the 30.67% tax rebate) and in April 1995 was $35 per week with no tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to medical cover for doctors' visits, in June 1983 HBA cover for doctors' visits was $5 per week in Victoria ($3.47 after the tax rebate).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus the total after tax cost for basic medical and hospital cover was $9.57 per week in 1983, or $497.64 per annum ($892.43 in December 1994 dollars). The Medicare levy is now $529.88 per annum and due to rise to $589.74 per annum by December. The 37.2% of people who have retained private hospital insurance <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">are much worse off</EMPHASIS>; people who dropped private hospital insurance are better off (assuming waiting lists are not a problem) but are becoming less so. People who preferred to self-insure are worse off as they, like those with private hospital insurance, are being forced to pay twice, if they wish to have their doctor of choice. People who preferred to purchase cheaper risk-rated health insurance products are also worse off, as these insurance options have now been prohibited by law. Low income earners are unaffected as they are exempt from the Medicare levy and in 1982 they were eligible for free bulk billing for doctors' visits and free public hospital accommodation if they were classed as disadvantaged and thus had a pensioner health benefits card or a Health Care Card. Some 2.3 million people were covered by these cards at 30 June 1982 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Statements 1982-83</EMPHASIS> p 89).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It might also be noted that the Social Security analysis disputes the inclusion of the Medicare levy while arguing that disposable income figures in real terms (ie adjusted by the CPI) should be used. Since, however, the Statistician discounted the CPI on the introduction of Medicare, no objection can be taken by Social Security to the inclusion of the Medicare levy, if the CPI is to be used to compare disposable incomes over time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SOCIAL SECURITY COMMENT</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is asserted that "the table is misleading in other ways." It is asserted that "the amount included for income tax paid in 1982 indicates that a high level of deductions has been assumed for that year but not for 1994 and 1995". It is also asserted that "the level of rebates claimed for 1982 is too high as only Spouse, HCCA and low income rebates are mentioned."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSE:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the footnotes to my table indicated, the tax scales and rebate levels applied are those which were in force in the month of December. The new rate scale and spouse rebate levels ($1,030 for a spouse where there are dependent children) came into effect on 1 November 1982 and were "fully reflected in PAYE instalments from 1 November 1982" (see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Statements 1982-83</EMPHASIS> p 240). The December figures show the tax on a PAYE earner at that time. There is nothing misleading about looking at where a worker is at a point of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security table is also in error by using the lower $830 "without child" level of the spouse rebate. This $200 error plus its use of the full year rate scale instead of the December rate scale accounts for its Table 1 showing a lower level of tax increase (ie Social Security claimed the tax rate rose by 1.59 percentage points instead of 3.69 percentage points).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SOCIAL SECURITY COMMENT</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security's Table 2 to their Attachment B attempts to minimise the significance of tax increases by asserting that "the disposable income of the sample family has increased slightly</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in real terms over the period". It is suggested in a handwritten note that such a family will be $12.55 a week better off by December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extraordinary thing is that Social Security admits that there have been tax increases from 1982 to 1994 and 1995, even on their own figures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security also admits that, on their methodology (which looks at changes in disposable income in absolute dollar terms rather than the dollars lost by increased effective tax rates), the disposable income of the family will fall from $31,122.15 to $30,924.66 per annum in the year to December 1995. In other words, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">even Social Security admits that a one income family on male earnings with a dependent spouse and two children will be $3.80 per week worse off by the end of this year.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Social Security's methodology also needs to be questioned. It is no consolation for any family to be told that although the Government is taking a larger slice of the pay packet, the Government is still leaving enough not to make the family worse off&mdash;the percentage increase in tax is still outstripping the percentage increase in income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Social Security's approach, the Government could argue that as long as disposable income of a family was at the same level as it was in 1901, then there has been no real increase in taxation since 1901. That is a nonsense and taxpayers are concerned about how much of their families' incomes are being taken in taxation&mdash;they don't see why all their productivity gains or extra work effort should be appropriated by Government. But, in fact, it is not even true that government is still leaving people better off. There is no genuine increase in disposable family income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Social Security paper concedes, the effective tax rate has risen. However, the Social Security analysis does not really address the additional impact of other Federal taxes and increased State and Federal indirect taxation. While some of these taxes are reflected in the CPI, many (such as broadened sales tax) would have a differentially more severe impact on families. Families would also suffer relatively more from the disguised increased taxation involved in water and electricity dividends paid to State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, if tax collected from fringe benefits and superannuation funds are distributed evenly per capita over the PAYE workforce the average increase in the tax burden is $793 per annum or $15.26 per week in 1994-95. (Fringe benefits tax was $2,720 million and super funds tax was $1,900 million; $4,620 million in 1994-95. The number of employed wage and salary earners was 5,823,500). These taxes are taxes on employees and were intended to be so, just as much as PAYE income tax. These taxes alone cancel out Social Security's suggested gain in disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another hidden tax is the 6% compulsory employer superannuation contribution. It can be described as a tax because it is a compulsory contribution made out of foregone wages and imposed under sanction of the superannuation guarantee levy. The employer and employee superannuation contributions are to be compulsory payments made in lieu of wages. They will be akin to a 12% flat rate income tax surcharge. A major purpose of the compulsory superannuation scheme is to force people to save themselves out of the age pension, as evidenced by the figures in Table I of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving for Our Future.</EMPHASIS> If the current 6% employer contribution is included as an income tax surcharge the figures are far worse for the Government's record. It is as though 6% of a worker's income is subject to a 100% tax rate and is gone before he even sees it. This quasi-tax is not reflected either in taxation statistics or the CPI. While it may be argued that it is better for people to save now rather than rely on taxing other people's children to pay them age pensions, one should not lose sight of the fact that today's workers are being forced to take a cut in disposable income compared to their predecessors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to indirect taxation, total indirect taxes in the December 1994 quarter were $15,203 million or 19.2% of household disposable income versus $5,650 million which was 17% of household disposable income. The increases in the petrol excise and in the basic sale tax rate since 1993 have not been insignificant in their effect. A surcharge of 2.2% taxation on household disposable income is equivalent to an income tax surcharge of another 2.2*(1-.1777) or 1.81%. This is equivalent to a loss $684.70 per annum or $13.17 per week. While various indirect taxes are reflected in the CPI, the CPI does not reflect the differentially more severe impact on families of many indirect taxes. The CPI is based on all consumers, young, single, old as well as families with children. This was why the average price effect claimed for the 15% GST prior to the 1993 election was subject to such scrutiny. The same scrutiny may usefully be applied to Social Security computing family disposable incomes using the CPI where there are changes of indirect taxes over a period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even in Canberra which is better off than most of Australia, indirect charges can look large compared to Social Security's alleged gain. For example, a worker in Canberra city now has to pay $25 per week for car parking where it was free in 1982. That non-tax deductible cost of working is alone double Social Security's alleged gain in household disposable income. There are, of course, miscellaneous other charges which would bear more heavily on families eg "voluntary" public school contributions or pre-school fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of reduced Commonwealth funding for the States has also had an effect. States and Territories have been forced to put up their charges and squeeze dividends out of public utilities through rigorous adherence to user pays principles. As noted by the Australian Automobile Association (January 1995) "The commercialisation and privatisation of Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) such as communications, electricity, water and sewerage has been accompanied by State and Federal Treasuries transferring existing funded public assets to GBEs at replacement value and imposing spurious `dividend' requirements on GBEs which must in turn be recovered by `user charges.'  The result has been a recent meteoric rise in indirect taxation in Australia disguised as `user charges' This form of tax has increased by 650% since 1987/88 from $400 million to $3 billion" (in 1993/94). None of this hidden taxation shows up in official taxation statistics. While such charges are reflected in the CPI they bear more heavily on families than other consumers on average. The failure of governments to pass on to consumers the savings from labour shedding in public utilities means that family taxpayers are having to pay taxes to support these displaced workers while getting little reduction in utility charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has asserted (Hansard 1 June 1995 p 902) that "the best measure of living standards in Australia is real household disposable income" and that between 1983 and 1995 real household disposable income grew by 40 per cent. The Prime Minister himself admitted this figure to be irrelevant as soon as he said it and that "because the population has grown since then, it is more relevant to look at the numbers per head". He then argued that disposable income per head in the last March quarter was $3,568 compared with the March quarter of 1983, an increase of 19.8 per cent. This figure is equally a nonsense as it fails to adjust for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increased working hours by primary breadwinners;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increased reliance by families on a second breadwinner; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a smaller number of children per household.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As national income economists, such as the late Professor R I Downing of Melbourne University have long recognized, it is absurd for anyone, including the Prime Minister, to talk about increased national or household income when labour market patterns are changing. As Professor Downing pointed out, in World War II many wives went to work in factories and "if in peacetime a large number of housewives decided to take paid jobs and to employ housekeepers, national product would include not only the paid work done by housewives, but also the paid work done by housekeepers. Yet to the extent that housekeepers were doing exactly the same work previously done by housewives, there would have been, on that account, no true increase in national product." (Downing,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> National Income and Social Accounts</EMPHASIS> 12th Edition, 1969, pp 47-48).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people would be amazed to be told that if you work a 48 hour week instead of a 40 hour week and get 20 per cent more income, you are 20 per cent better off. That would only be true if you attach no value at all to time to rest, sport, worship or to be with your spouse and family. Most people find that working longer hours puts considerably more stress on family and personal relationships and their quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The apparent gain in disposable income per head is thus doubly bogus. Even if family disposable income had increased by $12.55 per week, that "gain" would have been purchased by full time </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">employees working longer hours. They are working harder than ever to defend their families' standards of living. ABS statistics show that full time workers are now working an average of 43 hours per week rather than 38.2 in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their disposable incomes should be 4.8/38.2 or 12.6% higher than in 1982 if taxation burdens had remained unchanged. A bogus 2.8% increase in disposable income has been gained at the expense of a 12.6% increase in hours worked. Everybody knows families are working harder and harder simply to pay more and more direct and indirect taxation to Government for less and less&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">the Government, on its own figures, is seizing 78% of the extra work being put in by wage earners.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures given on the social wage for low income earners really prove the point since the Social Security note admits most "assistance to families" is targeted. This means that, almost</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by definition, the average earner is being cut out of what he pays for. In other words ordinary Australian families are getting a raw deal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not deny that low income large families have gained from social transfers. But it is entirely misleading to describe such social transfers as a "social wage" when so many families are being systematically means tested out of any social recognition of the horizontal equity issues raised by their support of dependants. The situation is not like it was in the 1940s when workers sacrificed wage claims in order to fund a universal child endowment scheme which benefited every worker's family. You might call that a "social wage" but you cannot legitimately pretend that means tested welfare is some sort of social supplement to the earnings of most workers whose families get little or nothing out it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If one takes the Government's 1994-95 Budget figures, most of the social transfers in the family payments area are going to low income and sole parent families (see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Statements 1994-95</EMPHASIS> p 3.99 Table 4.4). As far as most ordinary one or two income families go, basic family payments are going to fewer of them and shrinking in relative size. They have got very little or nothing from the so-called "social wage" since December 1982 and many have lost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is wrong to assert there are improvements to the social wage while with the next breath admitting that the Government has been doing its best to give less to middle income families. For most families the social wage in 1982 included schools and hospitals just as it does in 1995. They are paying more for what they used to have anyway and being left with less of their incomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in opposition to Senator Troeth's matter of public importance today which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's neglect of Australian families, demonstrated by falling living standards, high unemployment, family breakdown and associated social costs.</PARA>
<PARA>What we see here today is the result of Liberal Party strategy, based on their Republican advisers advice. The advisers who gave them push polling are now bringing this American strategy of appeal to the family and battlers to the Australian debate. The difficulty which they are going to have with this particular line is, firstly, that they are not particularly well-connected to those people in Australian society and do not have very good links into their concerns and issues. Secondly, the premise on which this approach and today's discussion are based is a false one. It is based, firstly, on an assumption that living standards are falling, and that is clearly not the case. While there is debate about the various statistical analyses, there is no evidence to suggest that living standards are falling. In fact, quite the opposite: they are on the rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second assumption made by the matter of public importance is that unemployment is high and it implies that it is worsening. In fact, unemployment is falling and the general employment situation is improving quite considerably. I think the third assumption has been adequately dealt with by the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, and Senator West. It goes to the range of government programs which are trying to deal in a positive way with family breakdown and associated social costs. Those two speakers spent a great deal of time expounding the range of social, wage and other initiatives of this government that have sought to help families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before looking at a couple of those economic issues I want to attack what I think is the other assumption which underlines this matter of public importance; the assumption that somehow families are some distinct subgroup of Australian society and that they are not exposed to the general economic and social conditions that impact on their lives, that they experience, say, as workers, as recipients of social security or as members of community organisations. Families are not some subset removed from the rest of our society and community. People who are members of families are impacted on by all government policies. I think it is rather trite to say, `Let's look at family policy,' without looking at everything which impacts on Australian citizens, because they are members of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point that I wish to make is that the 1995-96 budget was about families in the sense that it was about continuing a high growth, low inflation and improving employment economy. That is good for all Australians. If it is providing jobs, protecting people's investments, savings and wages through low inflation and providing growth in the economy, that is good for all Australian families. As the Liberal Party and others continually lecture us, growth in the economy is the key to employment and a range of the other social objectives that we all share. So rather than trying to isolate some of the statistics we have heard today to try to prove some sort of case that the Labor government is anti-family, we must look at the big picture and at what we are doing. The starting point for that must be employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is the greatest blight on families and individuals in our society. We have taken a very serious attitude to trying to tackle what are unacceptably high levels of unemployment. The April figures showed that nationally unemployment had fallen to 8.3 per cent. That is the lowest figure since December 1990 and should be welcomed by all Australians. Employment grew by 90,000, and 80,000 of those were full-time jobs. It is equally the case that the participation rate was up to 63.7 per cent in April, so we had falling unemployment, employment growth and a high participation rate. Those are all very good indicators of employment growth and the fact that we are tackling the major problem that affects Australian families&mdash;that is, unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a tribute to the Working Nation strategy adopted by this government, a strategy is delivering jobs and it is also delivering jobs for the long-term unemployed, the persons who otherwise would be left behind in any economic recovery. That strategy has now been endorsed by a range of countries as an example of what should be done as one comes out of recession to make sure that the long-term unemployed benefit from growth in the economy and growth in jobs. When you are talking about families you have to start with that employment context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things one ought to talk about is mortgage rates. We have heard the opposition talk a lot about mortgage rates in the past but now that the budget has delivered downward pressure on mortgage rates in the Australian community, it is less keen to talk about it. We heard no mention today of what the downward pressure on mortgage rates means for families. What it means is that they are not suffering from increased mortgage payments and the high cost that that places on household budgets. Families look like benefiting in the short term in terms of reduced mortgage interest rates. There have already been some encouraging signs of reductions in rates by a couple of lenders in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has a major impact on families because, along with wages and taxation, mortgages are obviously a big factor for a large percentage of the Australian population in terms of their disposable income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is very interesting because it highlights the fact that the government has spent $200 million of taxpayers' money over the last five years promoting itself to the Australian community; $200 million of taxpayers' money is the subject of this audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the audit are startling as well. For example, in the appendices, there is a series of sample advertising campaigns commissioned on behalf of the government. One of the findings was that in the sample advertising campaigns chosen by the Australian National Audit Office not one of the departments set a performance target for the advertising campaign before commissioning it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have an advertising campaign on which we are going to spend millions of dollars, but the department which commissions the campaign does nothing to measure the effectiveness of the campaign against its supposed objectives. I believe that there is a very good reason for this. The very good reason is that many of the advertising campaigns which have been commissioned by this government have simply been launched for political purposes rather than for anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In appendix 6 on page 48 of the report we see the heading `Medicare Hospital Entitlements Campaign', a campaign on which the Department of Human Services and Health has spent $3.3 million. It is interesting to see that the minister is in the chamber. One of the stated reasons for the campaign is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To increase the proportion of Australians who are aware of their entitlements under the Medicare health system, including free treatment in public hospitals</PARA>
<PARA>Another reason was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To increase awareness of initiatives to improve public hospital service and the benefits these improvements will provide</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this report is going out there to promote how wonderful the government is because we have got Medicare. That is really what it is all about. It is nothing but a very blatant, very unsubtle media campaign to bolster the government's electoral fortunes&mdash;funded with $3.3 million of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the minister sitting on the other side of the chamber making all sorts of faces, as well she might. The fact is that, at the same time that the government was saying that we ought to increase private health cover&mdash;</PARA>

As far as I know, nothing more than a grave frown crossed my brow. I think it is rather silly for you to start abusing me. I think that the standing orders in this place suggest that you stick to the debate and stop being so personal in your attack. You are wanting to argue&mdash;incorrectly&mdash;about the Medicare documentation, yet you are not arguing the Medicare issue, you are arguing about me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the minister never has a point of order&mdash;she never has a point, actually. This $3.3 million of taxpayers' money is being used to bolster the electoral fortunes of the government, and the government has been caught out. It has been caught with its fingers in the till. At the same time that the government was spending $3.3 million to say what wonderful people its members were because they were providing the Medicare system, they were running around saying that we need to keep 40 per cent of the community with private health cover. In other words, this advertising campaign&mdash;I almost made the Freudian mistake of calling it an electoral campaign&mdash;was working directly against the government's stated interest of ensuring that 40 per cent of families in the community had private health cover. So it starts to look increasingly like a biased, blatant political exercise to spend $3.3 million to bolster the electoral fortunes of the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through each one of the appendices&mdash;I do not intend to do so&mdash;and point out that none of them had performance targets set; and, in fact, I cannot see many that have attempted to monitor the long-term key campaign results. Only one, relating to illicits and amphetamines&mdash;an entirely commendable area of concern&mdash;seems to be `monitoring target audiences' behaviour towards illicit drugs and other Drug Offensive campaign issues.' That is great, but that is the only one where there is any long-term measuring of the advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you well know that, if you are a business in the private sector which spends money on advertising, you monitor the results of the advertising. If you do not monitor the results of the advertising, you do not know whether you are throwing your money away or whether you are getting some benefit for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a very clear reason why the government has no interest in monitoring the results of the advertising campaign. It is because the real reason for the advertising campaign is different from the reason which is stated in the report. The reason for government advertising as stated in the report is to inform people of their obligations and their rights. The real reason for this government spending so much money on advertising is to bolster its electoral support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If proof is needed, I refer honourable senators opposite to the fact that the Auditor-General in this report again refers to the National Media Liaison Service as being part of the government media mechanism&mdash;the means by which the government chooses to advertise. We know that in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No. 19</EMPHASIS> of 1994-95, the Auditor-General was highly critical of the National Media Liaison Service. In fact, he said that it was a loophole through public accountability, and reference is made to it again in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Media Liaison Service issue will not go away. The government can stick its head in the sand as much as it likes, but the truth is that everybody out there knows that the government has a group of flunkies whose job is to monitor members of the opposition and feed the information back to the ministers' offices so that the government can make direct attacks on members of the opposition. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber know that everywhere they go, they are being watched. They know that every word they say on radio is being monitored, and anything the government does not like attracts immediate criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that members of the National Media Liaison Service, led by Mr Epstein&mdash;even though he pretends he is not the Director of the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;are also spending a large chunk of their time circulating throughout the press gallery upstairs on the second floor and spreading documents on members of the opposition which are highly defamatory. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill) has seen that sort of conduct; he has been on the receiving end of that sort of conduct.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now go to the detail of this report. It is reasonable to point out that some of the advertising is of very high quality. As the Auditor-General points out, Commonwealth campaigns have won numerous advertising awards in recent years. One reason for this is that price is no object. The Auditor-General expresses concern about this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.price does not enter into the consideration of the competitiveness of creative agencies' strategies.</PARA>

<PARA>I also wonder whether it goes to a few mates. However, that issue is not entered into in this audit.

I am intrigued to know what all those other considerations are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the interjection from Senator O'Chee. It could well be Labor Party affiliation. I understand that the ANAO has not gone down that track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, the Auditor-General has concluded that a register, such as OGIA's register of consultants, is an efficient and effective method of identifying the most appropriate creative agency for a given campaign. But he considers that alternative management arrangements should be examined with a view to making it more cost effective. I say amen to all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I underline Senator O'Chee's point that there is very little effective measurement of whether these very expensive advertising campaigns are meeting any of the objectives. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departments have not evaluated the success of campaigns against stated campaign objectives. In some instances, Departments did not fully understand the consequences of using certain evaluation techniques. Inadequacies in evaluation cast doubts on the claims for the success of some campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about peanuts; we are talking about $200 million of Australian taxpayers' money. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.with the exception of Defence, none of the campaigns' objectives derived by departments was expressed in quantitative terms. Campaigns typically do not include reference to performance measures. By not setting performance targets departments are not able to determine whether the campaign is likely to give value-for-money or at what stage it becomes uneconomic to undertake or continue the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>This is absolutely damning from the Auditor-General. The report says that the government is spending many millions of dollars and does not know whether it is worthwhile to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the question of whether the advertising is always correct. It is very disturbing to note in the Auditor-General's report a matter relating to advertising by the Australian Taxation Office. The Auditor-General considers that material to be disseminated should be accurate, comply with any applicable legislation and abide by advertising industry standards. He points out that two superannuation guarantee print advertisements, as put out by the Australian Taxation Office, were found by the Advertising Standards Council to be in breach of the advertising code of ethics. He says that, in the first instance, which was essentially a procedural problem, the Australian Taxation Office commenced its advertising for the superannuation guarantee campaign before the enabling legislation had been passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that it got caught by this. Quite frankly, I am sick and tired, as I am certain the Senate and the people of Australia are, of legislation by decree. The government says what it will do. Months and months later, the legislation eventually comes up before the chambers. In this case, the Australian Taxation Office subsequently had to withdraw the advertisements. The problem arose because of a clerical error associated with the passage of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departments may sometimes find themselves in a position where the introduction of Government initiatives is affected by delays or changes resulting from the legislative process or other circumstances beyond their control. It is recognised that these events may have an effect on the advertising content and campaign timetables.</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation is only legislation in effective terms after it has passed this chamber and received&mdash;I will continue to use these words&mdash;`royal assent'. It is not legislation just because some jumped-up lackey of this government says that it is. It is disgraceful that we have advertising campaigns undertaken before the legislation passes the chambers, which have a duty to turn it into effective law. It is about time that the government stopped pre-empting the parliament and wasting taxpayers' money on advertising laws that have not and will not come into effect because of clerical mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element is worse. In the second breach of the advertising code of ethics, the Advertising Standards Council ruled that another superannuation guarantee print advertisement was misleading and deceptive. That is a good description of the government. It is very disappointing to see that as a description of an advertisement put out by the Australian Taxation Office in relation to a superannuation guarantee campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned to read this Auditor-General report. It is phrased in very restrained language. I am also concerned about some other elements of it. For example, the Auditor-General says that some of the target audiences are a bit strange. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET justified its use of television by stating that it wanted to reach the campaign's secondary target audience, `the general community'. However, without specific market research&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Auditor says&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to establish the extent to which secondary target audiences influence primary target audiences, DEET ran the risk of wasting a significant amount of resources on this campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>A significant amount of resources in this case adds up to a fair few dollars. The DEET campaign was either $2.4 million or $0.5 million. The superannuation guarantee campaign cost something like $9 million. That is the one that did not meet the Advertising Standards Council requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also notes that errors in central advertising system data indicate a weakness in OGIA's management of creative agency expenditure and its recording system. The Auditor also found this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.departmental Annual Information Plans . . . do not perform their intended function;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.OGIA's creative agency shortlisting process may not always result in the Commonwealth achieving the best value-for-money. Nor, at the time of the audit, did OGIA document the shortlisting process.</PARA>
<PARA>I raised the next matter earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.price does not enter into the consideration of the competitiveness of creative agencies' strategies . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.contracts are not used to appoint creative agencies to government advertising campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA>The Ministerial Committee on Government Information and Advertising requires departments to prepare and submit portfolio annual information plans for consideration. Annual information plans contain summaries of each major information activity that a portfolio intends to undertake in the coming financial year and each major activity undertaken in the past financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office questions the value added by AIPs at present because they were not considered by the MCGIA between September 1991 and 1994. A significant number of departments submit their AIPs well past the due date. Nearly 60 per cent of planned activities are not undertaken, and nearly half of the major activities actually undertaken are not recorded as planned activities on AIPs. The whole system is a farce.

It is only normal for opposition parties to be disturbed when governments spend large whacks of taxpayers' money on so-called information campaigns. I am sure in Victoria and Western Australia, where we have Liberal state governments, that the opposition criticises those state governments about information campaigns on a regular basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a society where the parliament must scrutinise government expenditure, it is very important to ensure that we are not moving into an Orwellian era where the government controls matters of information and tells the people what is good for them for political purposes. There is a very genuine need for governments at all levels to spend money, and sometimes considerable amounts of money, on education campaigns, particularly in relation to new government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reasons why I have always been amused by advertisements telling me how good Medicare is and how important it is that I am enthused about Medicare. The first reason is that I am not sure what my choice is if I do not like the product. In some respects I do like the product. It is very handy to have Medicare there when you have a couple of young children who continue to get earaches, runny noses and everything else. You can go to the doctor without worrying too much about the expense. The second reason is that people such as the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)&mdash;who is at the table and who has a smile on her face at the moment&mdash;the Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence) and a number of other government ministers over the year reassure us about how popular Medicare is, how well received it is and how important it is to so many Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be non-partisan and objective about it, a reflection of that is that Medicare and bulk-billing have become out of bounds as far as political tampering is concerned now. Of course, my leader, John Howard, made that quite clear in his speech last night when he committed the coalition to Medicare and to retaining bulk-billing. That is a very fair assessment of how well people understand Medicare and how attached they are to it. I do not know whether or not people are well aware of their entitlements under Medicare, because neither I nor the government have market tested it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the assumption we could fairly make, even based on the fairly broad measure that all political parties in this country will not tamper with Medicare or bulk-billing, is that people understand Medicare pretty well and those who seek to tamper with bulk-billing or Medicare are very concerned about suffering the political ramifications of that. I think it is fair to say that in the last election the coalition did suffer. There were many people out there who were concerned about having their access to bulk-billing and some of the benefits of Medicare taken away. So that is a broad market test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament and all parliamentarians should be concerned when Commonwealth taxpayers' money is used for blatant political purposes ostensibly disguised as an information campaign. I was concerned when I turned to page 48, appendix 6, of the report&mdash;and I commend all journalists on the second floor of this building and our friend in the gallery today&mdash;and saw the amount of money spent in a month on that Medicare campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If your objective were to `inform Australians as to their existing entitlements under the Medicare arrangements', you would expect that it would be an ongoing campaign. You would find out who did not understand what their entitlements were. There may well be some target groups, such as people from non-English speaking backgrounds. The target group may indeed be young people who have not had much access to the need for Medicare or medical service, because young people are generally fitter, and who may need to be informed of this. There may be all of those sorts of target groups and you would think that that campaign would go on for months, if not years, as a regular information period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But clearly the Department of Health, which decided to run this campaign, made a decision that in about January and February of 1993 there was to be this massive need to ensure that we all knew how good Medicare was for us. It may only be a coincidence that the election was in March 1993. Out of the $3.3 million, I think, that was spent on the entire campaign&mdash;and 39 per cent of that was spent on the creative side of it, which is not unusual; it is important to have good advertisements before you spend the money putting them on television&mdash;and it is a bit hard to read between the lines, something in the order of $2 million was spent in the weeks before the 1993 federal election. And if we look at the graph we will see that it was only a matter of weeks. It is fair to say that the coalition and all other parliamentarians who are concerned to see the government spending taxpayers' money wisely could be a little cynical about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee has referred me to page 45. I presume we have another little blimp in the graph. I did look at that, Senator O'Chee. I would give the government almost the benefit of the doubt. Senator O'Chee refers to expenditure under a Commonwealth employment service marketing campaign operated by DEET. I toyed with the idea of criticising the government for that. But to be generous to the federal government, which is not my nature, that money was spent towards the end of 1992, again just before the federal election, and you would have to say that that is a period of the year when a lot of young people do come onto the job market and would need information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to be slightly less generous, unemployment was extremely high in late 1992 and early 1993, but it was almost equally as high at the end of 1993 and at the end of 1994. If you look at the graphs you will see that nothing like the $1.4 million spent just before the last federal election was spent during those other times. Clearly the government decided that the young people did not need to know so much about the great services of the Commonwealth. I have been generous, but one could be cynical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare campaign is an absolute ripper. Looking at the graph, and it is not very descriptive, it seems that the need to spend nearly $2 million fell almost entirely in the six weeks before the federal election. Kerry Packer, Rupert Murdoch and the other television station proprietors around Australia must have thought, `This is great. Let's have more elections. This is fantastic.' We must watch the share prices of the listed television companies. Since we are on broadcast day, these might be considered as Senator Campbell's share market tips&mdash;early election speculation: `Buy media stocks, because the government will spend up big with your money.

It was conducted about three weeks ago. It was to judge the effectiveness of the Working Nation statement initiatives. There has been a very high profile and, I suspect, an expensive campaign featuring Bill Hunter asking employers to employ young people under the Working Nation initiatives. My office surveyed 100 small businesses in that area of Perth. Only 37 per cent of them had heard of Working Nation. I remind honourable senators that this was two or three weeks ago. Only two small businesses had taken any action as a result of those advertisements. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. Successive Governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. While the Budget as a whole is anticipated to be in surplus in 1995-96, there is a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of about $2.1 billion. The difference between the two estimated outcomes arises because appropriations from the CRF include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1995-96 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and, if necessary,  to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the Loan Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $9.7 million for 1995-96, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the Parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, it is nice to be able to get on to some sort of program. The time we have taken to get to this reflects the absolutely appalling mismanagement by this government&mdash;it has been going on for weeks and weeks and weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill amends the principal Qantas Sale Act 1992 to increase the foreign ownership limit for Qantas from 35 per cent of issued capital to 49 per cent and restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than a combined 35 per cent of the issued share capital. This increase in the access of foreign investment is a manifestation of the bill's intention to increase the foreign ownership limit to facilitate an appropriate return to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It should be pointed out that, currently, Qantas is already 25 per cent owned by British Airways. And the bill, I might say, is very regrettably necessary because this Labor government has plundered the savings of all Australians to the extent that we are not capable of buying Qantas at a price which would not be achievable without increased levels of foreign equity. It enables Qantas to widen the market so that an achievable price can be obtained. It would not be necessary if we did not have among the lowest savings ratio in the world. Certainly, compared with South East Asia, our savings ratio is very low indeed. Anyway, this is the sorry state of affairs in which we find ourselves. One must be realistic and, for this reason, the opposition will not be opposing the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation of Qantas is a move that the coalition supports for different reasons to the government. The government simply supports it because they want the money. The shifting of Qantas into the private sector, however, from a coalition point of view will enhance the competitive edge that Qantas has been successfully developing. The Qantas float will provide Australians with an opportunity to invest their savings into a genuine Australian business proposition as opposed to just the ALP's narrow and doubtful futuristic compulsory superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will no doubt argue that it is promoting savings through the superannuation scheme. But I would make the differentiation that the government is pushing them into survival savings; it is not talking about net investment savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the coalition is in agreement with the purpose of the legislation, the sale of Qantas has been a very sorry exposition of Labor Party incompetence, mismanagement and the subject of budgetary deception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Qantas has now been on the last five budgets. And in every single one of these budgets the prospective sale of Qantas has played a cosmetic role&mdash;it has simply been there to fool the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, through its now legendary mismanagement of the economy, has exploited the prospectus of various Commonwealth assets to cover its misdeeds and consequent predicament with the deficit. After years of grand expenditure from this tax and spend government, the ALP has created a budget deficit that has posed a threat to their re-election. The prospective Qantas float has been utilised to create a spurious budget surplus among other asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opinion that the decision to increase foreign ownership in Qantas will increase the value of the float by some $300 million&mdash;the estimates given in some quarters&mdash;constitutes the motive of the government in perpetrating its budgetary fraud, the fraud that the government has been responsible with its fiscal policy and has delivered a budget that has ensured the health of the Australian economy. Everyone knows how transparent that is. There is no budget surplus this year in real terms; it is a budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's track record on privatisation is by no means impressive. When you look at the facts, the proceeds from privatisation since the ALP have been in government have been below budget estimates by $5.1 billion&mdash;$5,100 million!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government should stop exploiting asset sales to suggest that it has been in charge of an economically judicious administration&mdash;privatisation does not whitewash years of electorally expedient fiscal irresponsibility which has become the hallmark of the Keating Labour government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of Qantas, whilst an intrinsically virtuous policy, has been cynically recruited by the government into a meretricious budget which has a bottom line deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas privatisation has endured a tortured and sclerotic evolution. This becomes apparent when you have a brief look at its history. The timetable for the float has been progressively delayed by the government from beginning to end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 Qantas and the former Australian Airlines were faced with uncommercial debt to equity ratios and therefore reasoned with the government about the possibility of greater access to equity capital. One of the few rational people who addressed this was ex-Senator Walsh who took the view&mdash;I think this is expressed in his recent book, for those who have taken the trouble to read it and, if they have not, they should&mdash;that it seemed fairly silly to him that year in, year out taxpayers were putting money into a commercial operation which could well have been done in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government finally responded to this call in September 1990 by deciding to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas. In April 1991 the government announced that the float of both airlines would be done as a trade sale. In June 1992 the announcement came that Qantas would be able to purchase Australian Airlines for $400 million and with 100 per cent rather than 49 per cent. In fact, interestingly, we have more icons of the old Labor Party thundering down, not because of any change in philosophy but simply because of the fact that, due to their own economic mismanagement, they want the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas articles of association were designed to safeguard the national interest. The most salient of these national interest protecting articles of association was the 35 per cent foreign holdings restriction on which the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These safeguards are important to maintain the basic character of Qantas, as well as to ensure that Qantas's operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not put under threat. Once in legislation, these safeguards will not be subject to the whim of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>He said they `will not be subject to the whim of the government of the day' when those opposite fixed the lid at 35 per cent. But they have been creeping up on the old lefties like Senator Burns, year in year out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the moveable feast of the Labor Qantas sale, the ALP threw away the cookbook a long time ago. It has been making it up as it goes along. After making this supposedly iron clad announcement, it is now allowing foreign ownership to go up to 49 per cent. The government did that because it needed the money. Probably more importantly, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this government over a period of 12 or 13 years has plundered the savings of Australians through our taxation system, not only in the direct taxation system by way of income tax, not only by way of indirect taxes which have risen so enormously in the past 12 years, but by there being a penalty on people who save and invest. Until that is addressed, we will not fix the incredible problem we have with low household savings in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does question the commitment of the Labor Party to the intrinsic reason for privatisation as a sound economic restructuring policy, as opposed to an instrument of its budget. It is clear from remarks made by various members of the Labor Party&mdash;members of parliament on the other side and, I think, some senators here&mdash;that the Labor Party is far from any ideological consensus on the subject of the privatisation of Qantas. In fact, there is no Labor commitment to the intrinsic value of the Qantas float; the commitment is simply to cook the books in the budgets we are given by this government year in, year out. This has been going on for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's whole program of privatisation has been as disingenuous as it has been a manifest example of maladministration. There is no doubt that markets in Australia have been freed up and, as has been said over and over, that is a good thing. It has made us competitive in some areas. But what has not happened is that the Labor market has been freed up. We cannot have one section of the market freed up and the other not, because one will counter the other. That is what is happening in this country. We know why. The people who write the laws for this government are part of the unelected ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the government's program of privatisation is that it has been disorganised and disorderly, careering around in a ramshackle fashion, making up a new direction on every one of its whims. Qantas is a serious international business that requires the vision and discipline of a forward looking government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a long association with Qantas. I suppose there might not be anyone else in this place who first flew with Qantas when I did. If my recollection is right, it was around October or November 1941. That is a long time to be flying with Qantas. I have seen that airline grow. My state has a close affinity with Qantas, shown by the very name: Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services. We have been very proud that its origins were in Queensland. It must be remembered that when Qantas started it was a privately owned company. It was only when Labor governments started thinking they should own airlines that this position changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose the bill. The reason for the bill, as I pointed out, is that there are not sufficient domestic savings in Australia to maximise revenue from the sale. The savings of people from other countries have to be included in the equation, in order to maximise the return. I do not dispute that there should be a fair market price for Qantas shares. That is very important, bearing in mind all the moneys put into Qantas over the years. It is only right that when the sale is made it should be done in a way that maximises that return. I am also aware of the fact that the reason for the increase in foreign ownership was to enable Qantas to broaden its market, because the market in Australia, in respect of funds available for investment, was too narrow. Again, that re-emphasises the point I made earlier, that this Labor government has plundered the savings of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, through its policy, has really stripped Australians of their savings. Under Labor, there is an in-built disincentive to save. I read comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) the other day. He was complaining, `The trouble with Japan is they save too much.' I think he then referred to `Australia' but he may well have said `the United States' when he said, `Australians spend too much.' The question of why that occurs has never been addressed. We do not have to do a survey and employ a consultant to find that out. The reason is that if people are frugal, put money aside and wish to invest it, they will be paying income tax at the highest marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though one would have expected&mdash;with the decrease in the inflation rate from the high figures of the mid-1980s and so on&mdash;there to have been more of an incentive to save, that has not happened because of the attitude of this government, `If you save you must be rich; and we will tax you.' But most people are not rich and this attitude is now coming home to haunt us. The only way we can be sure of maximising a return on the sale of the balance of Qantas is to look overseas to get more money in the pot, thus creating a bigger market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation recognises the state of our affairs. The majority of Australians&mdash;I am one, for sure&mdash;would prefer to see a great company such as this totally in the hands of Australian shareholders. There is no doubt about that. However, we cannot get away from the real world. As I have explained a number of times in the second reading debate, we do not have sufficient investment capital in this country to ensure a maximum price. Therefore, we have no option but to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Qantas Sale Amendment Bill seeks to do two things. First, it seeks to increase the total level of foreign ownership in Qantas from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. Second, it seeks to prevent the sale of more than 35 per cent of the airline to foreign-owned airlines. The government tells us that this will bring the ownership in Qantas in line with the general rules governing the ownership of Ansett. Those rules are already inserted into the Air Navigation Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at the reasons why the government has chosen to increase the foreign ownership level of Qantas. That increases the number of potential bidders, thereby increasing the total potential price. At one level, this is a very grubby revenue raising exercise. The principle that the national carrier should be nationally owned has to be abandoned. We would say as Australian Democrats that in some respects that has been sacrificed at the altar of the finance department, which runs revenue maximisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we need to go off-shore to maximise the return on selling Qantas? Senator Parer has talked about that; and I agree. We do not have the capital in this country&mdash;and those who do, do not always choose to invest in Australia. We should not overlook the fact that the federal government and the state governments are at the moment selling so many publicly owned assets that they are probably in danger of swamping the local financial market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next three years the federal government alone is proposing nearly $9 billion of asset sales. At the same time, the states are gearing up to sell off banks, TABs, water authorities, power stations, the right to build roads, and so forth. This new living, breathing entity called the Australian financial market is not an unlimited drip of money. With our low rate of national savings there is only so much money that can be found in this country to buy privatised bodies. Inevitably, money will be needed and it will come either by Australians borrowing overseas to fund their purchases or foreigners investing directly from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to stabilise our huge foreign debt the government, in our view, has rubber stamped a massive swap of debt for equity. As a nation we are still living beyond our means but, instead of borrowing the money, we are selling off the silver to pay the bills. What a choice we have! In the past 10 years the total level of foreign ownership of Australian assets has increased from $36 billion to $156.8 billion. In 1987, profits paid overseas accounted for just two per cent of our income from exports. Now it is over eight per cent and growing rapidly. The item, repayments on foreign investment, is one of the fastest growing items on our huge and deteriorating current account deficit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and growing. The Australian Democrats are not opposed to foreign investment but, as pointed out by Mr Vince FitzGerald, servicing of equity is usually more expensive&mdash;and more long term&mdash;than the servicing of debt.

At the moment it still seems to be assumed as a matter of faith that all foreign investment and ownership achieves this. I do not think we have asked enough questions. I do not think we have tested the faith on this sufficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask: have any of these sales achieved any of the export or productivity goals that Vince FitzGerald talks about? Could these goals have been achieved by other means? This has not been tested, particularly since 1986 and the then Treasurer Paul Keating's decision to change the test for approving foreign buyouts from one of having to prove net economic benefit to Australia, to the test of `not contrary to the national interest'. Around the same time, the `opportunities test'&mdash;that is, checking whether there was an equal Australian bid on offer&mdash;was also abandoned. This is particularly relevant in the recent public debate in this country on the sale of Fairfax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economists will tell us that also included in any test of the benefit of a foreign sale should be where the Australian funds and resources released by the sale are next employed. This is difficult, if not impossible, to measure. But it does appear that resources, instead of being reinvested in other productive enterprises, are going into three areas: private consumption, non-productive investment and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, foreign investment must be a partnership of measurable benefit to the nation. I would want to argue most strongly that national interest goals can still exist within a rapidly globalising world economy. The balance can be achieved, but I am afraid that it is something in which this government has, over the last decade, demonstrated a complete lack of interest. </PARA>

Foreign investment policy should fit into this overall strategy and not consist of simply opening the door and putting a `for sale' sign on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Foreign Investment Review Board has totally failed in its vitally important role of ensuring that foreign investment decisions are not contrary to the national interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time I considered asking the opposition to consider delaying the passage of this bill subject to the government's response because it seems to me to be quite irresponsible of us to say, `Don't worry about what happened with Fairfax. It will not happen again with the sale of Qantas because the Foreign Investment Review Board is a reformed body now. It really listens to what is said'. We have had no government response. I have no confidence that anything has changed and that the national interest in the sale of Qantas will be treated any differently from the national interest in the sale of Fairfax. That is why I prepared the second reading amendment which I have circulated in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular act requires any new owner to keep the name Qantas. What will it be attached to? The buyers of Fairfax told the Foreign Investment Review Board, `We will have an Australian chief executive officer'. It did not, and it does not, and nothing has been said or done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator parer on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995. At the risk of repeating what has already been said, the coalition will not oppose the bill. This bill amends the Qantas Sale Act 1992 and is going to increase the foreign ownership limit of Qantas privatisation from 35 per cent of issued capital to 49 per cent and will restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than a combined 35 per cent of issued share capital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should look back at the Qantas Sale Act 1992. In 1992 this government announced, after a lot of toing-and-froing, that 100 per cent of Qantas would be sold. The community's interest was said to be protected by a number of national interest safeguards. Senator Kernot has shown a lot of concern about that aspect here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other provisions included: the total foreign ownership was not to exceed 35 per cent and no single foreign interest could exceed 25 per cent; Qantas's operational base and headquarters was to remain in Australia; the name Qantas would be preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services; the company would be incorporated in Australia; and at least two-thirds of the Qantas board would be Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in the Qantas Sale Act 1992, the chairman of the board was to be Australian and the directors were to be provided with broad powers, including the power to deny registration or to force the disposal of shares held by foreigners to ensure that foreign ownership limits were not breached. The 1992 act also imposed a restriction to prevent votes of substantial foreign shareholdings, defined as being more than 15 per cent of voting shares in Qantas, being counted in any vote to appoint or remove more than one-third of the directors of Qantas at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to be changing the 1992 act. Mr Willis, in his second reading speech on 4 November&mdash;and I think Senator Parer must have been looking over my shoulder when I put my speech together because he quoted the same thing, but I will just say it again&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These safeguards are important to maintain the basic character of Qantas, as well as to ensure that Qantas's operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not put under threat. Once in legislation, these safeguards will not be subject to the whim of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>The whim of the government has changed, as we would expect. It is whimming here; it is whimming there; and it is whimming all over the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about the whim of the government, I will just remind the Senate that the 1992 One Nation statement announced an open skies agreement with New Zealand, which by November 1994 would allow Air New Zealand to compete in the domestic Australian market and open up the New Zealand market for Australian players. The government found out last year that this agreement would not benefit Qantas and, in fact, would have a substantial negative impact on its profitability. Then we found the Keating government re-enacting the underarm bowling incident and reneging on the agreement at the eleventh hour. I can tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the New Zealand people that I speak to, whether they be parliamentarians or ordinary people, have not forgotten the underarm bowling incident and keep reminding me about what happened with this supposedly open skies agreement. So Australia, once again, through the efforts of this government, has had to hang its collective head in shame at these embarrassing antics and whims and philanderings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know why the whim of the government has changed. It wants to prop up its shonky budget and con the Australian people once again. The only reason the government wants to increase foreign ownership is to get its grubby little hands on more cash, and the quicker the better. This government needs more cash to fund its budget, to finance its supposed surplus. It wants an extra $200 million to shore up this fudge-it budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard about this here yesterday in question time. The Keating government's surplus is nothing like the real surpluses of real economies like New Zealand's. The New Zealand government surplus is a real surplus which is going to pass on real tax cuts&mdash;not superannuation contributions that some people might be lucky enough to get from 1997 onwards. In this particular case, as has been said by two previous speakers, it is like selling the family home to buy the groceries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, like my colleague Senator Parer, am very proud of our national carrier and believe it must remain a part of the Australian identity. The flying kangaroo signifies a lot of things to a lot of people&mdash;getting home or the big trip away. I remember very well that in the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rain Man</EMPHASIS> it meant a lot to Dustin Hoffman, who was playing the part of rain man. When he was asked which was the safest airline in the world, he said, `Qantas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has a great tradition, but a lot of people are going to be disappointed. The reason they are going to be disappointed is that, for the wrong reasons, the government is selling off this airline at a time when we have the highest interest rates in the OECD; at a time when we have the highest sales taxing government in our history; and at a time when the value of the Australian dollar is dropping. I will tell you what&mdash;anybody from overseas buying into Qantas will be buying in at a bargain rate because of the price of our dollar at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, we have heard all this before, of course&mdash;this new-found privatisation ethos of the government. We have seen what has happened with the Commonwealth Bank. The government was not going to sell half of that, but ended up doing so because it wanted some more money for this so-called surplus that it is creating. It sold off the other half of the Commonwealth Bank, which it was never going to do, to the point where Mr Willis put out a false prospectus. Because he is the Treasurer and it is the government doing it, nothing will happen, but if you or I did that, we would end up in gaol or be heavily fined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at some of the other problems being faced by the privatisation program of this government. The government does not seem to know how privatisation works, and we only have to look at the proposed sale of the ANL to see that. So it is no wonder the government, when it considered selling Qantas, had to get in the Rowland Company to implement a communications strategy to encourage widespread public participation. It is no wonder it had to get Ernst and Young Registry Services as a share registrar. It is no wonder it had to get Reark Research to conduct a qualitative and quantitative research to gauge investor interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, we find that it is going to spend $20 million through the John Singleton Advertising company's ALP campaign. I noticed an article this week which said that high fliers were helping to get the Qantas float off the ground. The article mentions people like Kate Ceberano, Mandawuy Yunupingu and Paul Mercurio. I just hope they have enough money to be able to invest in Qantas. If they have spent their money investing in the Commonwealth Bank and a few of these other areas that the government is going to privatise, as Senator Kernot pointed out, there might not be too much money left around to invest in anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the government then turn around and spend $20 million on this campaign? There have been some serious doubts raised about this advertising campaign. Questions could be asked on another day about why the favoured tenderer for this particular campaign was John Singleton, but I will not go into that today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask ourselves what is privatisation really all about? What is real privatisation&mdash;not the phoney sort of privatisation for all the wrong reasons that this government is going on with. The coalition, on the other hand, has had a long history of support for privatisation. Our support is a philosophical one and so far different from the attitude of government. Our belief in privatisation starts with the ability of the private sector to provide the same goods and services more effectively and efficiently. That is one of the reasons why we privatise&mdash;to allow the private sector to provide those services in a more efficient manner. The community service obligations of government must be part of the private sector management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main aim of privatisation is that any proceeds of these sales must, and I repeat `must', be used to reduce our public indebtedness. Australians, as we all know, must increase their private savings, and Senator Kernot raised that matter quite strongly. The coalition sees privatisation as a way of increasing the number of Australians who are investing in Australia. But, if there is not a national savings policy, there will not be enough people with enough money to invest in all these enterprises that are being privatised. The only view that we get from the government is this very narrow view that, as far as national savings is concerned, its idea is compulsory superannuation. It thinks that is the only way to increase the private savings of Australians. It is a rather blinkered approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other ways. Senator Parer mentioned the Japanese and their savings. They have had a compulsory savings scheme since the war, since the rehabilitation of Japan. It is through that scheme that they have had so much capital with which to expand into investment, manufacturing and the like. The same goes for Singapore. But in this country we have never had a decent national savings scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few general comments about privatisation. For a long time, privatisation was a dirty word as far as particular sections of the Labor Party were concerned. There were a lot of doubts about there being any advantages to privatisation. But there is international evidence that privatisation works, particularly in higher or middle income countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank estimates that, around the world, 15,000 separate state owned enterprises have been privatised since 1990. The same research demonstrates increases in domestic welfare and productivity as a result. In most cases identified by the World Bank, consumers have benefited or, at worst, were no worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that privatisation does not come easily to a Labor government. It certainly transgresses the political ideology of the Left wing. This has led to some division and resentment within the party. It has also meant that we have inherited an ad hoc approach to privatisation rather than a detailed strategic plan for privatisation over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot said, we have something like $9 billion worth of possible projects that will come onto the market in one big hit. I have already mentioned the problems with the Australian National Line. That is a fair indication of this government's failure to understand how privatisation works. The Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, has already indicated publicly that ANL is in such a bad condition that the government could not give it away. That is a bit of an indictment on the government's attitude to privatisation and the way in which it runs those enterprises. The debate over the sale of the Federal Airports Corporation has also left the community wondering where the government is heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to look at some decent examples of privatisation, it need go no further than the Port of Auckland in New Zealand where privatisation has reduced running costs by 43 per cent in real terms. In England, when the Tilbury docks were privatised as part of a management-staff buy-out, shareholders saw the value of their shares increase from #1 to #11 in only 2 1/2 years. That is the way you do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some successes in Australia&mdash;I am not going to be all negative&mdash;such as the privatisation of the coal loaders at Port Kembla, which has already proven its worth. Costs have fallen by 22 per cent in the first year after privatisation in 1990. I just wonder when we are going to see action on some of the other waterfronts. We have seen a bit of action in Western Australia but it has been the wrong sort of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we are privatising for the wrong reasons. The government is desperate for cash. It looked at Qantas and said, `Gosh, it has been on the shelf for five years. We had better dust it off, change the act and get some more foreign ownership in.' It is a bit like a used car that you have had sitting in the yard for three or four years trying to flog it. You spend a bit of money on it, you tart it up&mdash;put some mag wheels on it and a stripe down the side&mdash;and hope you will get rid of it. That is what the government is doing with Qantas. It is making it more attractive by allowing more foreign ownership so it can get a better price for it. But in the scheme of things, that is not the way it should have been done. It has been done for all the wrong motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition will not be opposing the bill, our ideas and beliefs on privatisation are in total contradiction to those of the government. The government's motives are sneaky and shoddy. It is trying to prop up the fudge-it budget. It is only interested in the money, not in gaining real benefits for the country, which is what we should be looking for. We need to reduce our foreign debt. We need to apply the benefit of privatisation for the good of all Australians. Unfortunately, this measure is being rushed through to allow the government to portray this budget as a budget in surplus when, as we all know, it has been a smoke and mirrors trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that by bringing money from overseas it will not help our foreign debt situation. As Senator Kernot so ably said, the servicing of equity is far more expensive than the servicing of debt. All in all, while we do not oppose this sale of Qantas we believe that the government has shown once again that it is not capable of privatising correctly let alone running the country in the way it should be run. It certainly cannot present the sorts of budgets we need. </PARA>

I am probably a bit sadder than most people in this place about the passage of this bill because, as I have mentioned before in this place, I was an employee of Qantas for six years in the 1970s. That was a time when the employees of that organisation were very proud of our standards of service, not just the on-board standards&mdash;the flashy giveaways, the frequent flyer points, and so on&mdash;but the standards of training and the standard of service provided to the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fight to retain a national airline is already lost. Qantas will be privatised. In spite of many community objections to privatisation, it has already gone. In some sense, as with other government business enterprises, it was lost as an effectively publicly owned enterprise operating in the public interest when it was corporatised. To a certain extent, Qantas has always operated in a mode quite different from the Public Service. It was always working within a competitive environment which, with various levels of industry deregulation, has become more and more cut-throat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you do not see are the bits behind the front of an airline. They include such things as pre-flighting, which I do not think exists so much any more. Pre-flighting means preparing for the flight, actually making sure that those booked were going. We did not have the situation of regularly overbooking and hoping those people did not turn up. It also meant preparing for people with medical problems, for children travelling alone, making sure they were looked after. I cannot tell you with any certainty how Qantas operates now in relation to pre-flight but I can say it was one of those areas on which there was a lot of emphasis in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the point of corporatisation the government effectively said that public interest was no longer its prime consideration in operating the national carrier. It would be just as if the Commonwealth had shares in a normal company: the company would not pursue non-commercial community objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate at this stage that the Greens will be supporting the second reading amendments of the Australian Democrats. We believe that any measures that try to make sure that public interest is incorporated into the sale and privatisation of Qantas should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what about this bill? We still have concerns that cost cutting by privatisation will mean that Qantas will lose its status as the safest airline in the world. We are still concerned that Qantas, on its domestic routes, will make commercial decisions not to fly the less heavily loaded routes and, in the process, eliminate air transport to smaller and more isolated parts of the country. Will this bill make that more likely or make things worse? I cannot say that positively. I am fairly certain that giving greater control to foreign shareholders will not make things any better in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will not improve anything. There is no reason that we can see to support it, and we will not. There is no reason to pass more control of any interests overseas. The government keeps some impression of Australian control by setting foreign equity at a limit of 49 per cent. What a joke! Anyone who knows much about corporate control knows that effective control does not require absolute control through 50 per cent of share ownership. The effect of dispersing shareholding in Australia through selling to many shareholders is to increase the relative power of larger shareholders. A more effective mechanism of maintaining a measure of national control could be to demand that at least 50 per cent of foreign ownership be through small share sales on foreign exchanges, rather than allowing British Airways to get 25 per cent and another foreign airline to get 10 per cent, with the remaining 14 per cent potentially held in the hands of one or two `foreign persons', which I assume include foreign companies other than airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, what we see here is the passage of another icon, along with Vegemite and most of our other processed food companies, to overseas hands. We move one step closer to turning Australia into a company town in which we are all tenants. This is not a plug for nationalism; it is a plug for community interests. Australia was one of the first countries in the world which had an airline because of the distances in Australia. We need to look at our transport routes and what we will do with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that today is a very sad day. I am pleased to see the opposition recognise the cynicism associated with this bill, but it is sad to see that, whichever way it goes, however badly it is organised, it will still support the bill. I would like to think that there will be some mechanism by which all government business enterprises can answer to public interest, even though there is a greater level of privatisation. I have yet to see any evidence that the government has the mechanisms or the political will to enforce this. I have yet to be convinced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support my colleagues Senator Calvert and Senator Parer in their remarks on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995. This is an important bill. It is certainly an important bill for the government. It is rendered necessary through the government's desperate lack of cash and the need to find some money to bridge the huge gap between its expenditure and its revenue before taking assets sales into account. A final figure for the float of 75 per cent of Qantas is not specifically known as yet and will not be known until the proceeds are in. According to the Department of Finance in the Senate estimates process, it is envisaged that the float will take place in the next couple of months. We could see the proceeds in August if, for once in the government's history, it gets the handling of this bill right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year when the Qantas amendment bill was debated, it was said that the 75 per cent could be worth somewhere between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. The fact that this bill is extending the permissible amount of foreign ownership presumably will mean that the government expects to get some more money as a result. If we stick another couple of hundred million dollars onto that, we could well be looking at proceeds of $2 1/2 billion. That will be a major contribution towards the $5 1/2 billion of assets sales that the government has planned in this budget to meet the gap between its expenditure and its revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that the government is using the proceeds of assets sales to meet recurrent expenditure. But the only legitimate financial consequence of assets sales is to reduce the public debt. The fact that the government will be using the proceeds of the Qantas float only to meet its recurrent expenditure is a tragedy. In essence, it means that the government is selling off its prized assets so that it can pay for its groceries. That is what the government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have debated the sale of Qantas for a long time. In preparing some of the background notes for my contribution, I went back to an urgency debate that took place six years ago yesterday, on 6 June 1989. The opposition moved a matter of urgency; namely, the need for the government to ensure the future of Qantas and Australian Airlines by their sale to the public as suggested by the Minister for Transport and Communications and supported by the Prime Minister. The reason we moved that urgency debate in June 1989 was that we believed the only way to get real efficiency and competition and to maximise the resources and asset of the airlines was to privatise them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy at that time was that the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, and the present Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, along with Senator Button and Senator Peter Walsh, agreed with the coalition about the need to privatise Qantas. They were rolled by the left wing of the Labor Party at that time. They were rolled on several other significant occasions after that before they managed to break the deadlock that existed within the Labor Party at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a progressive breaking of the deadlock, and it is only in the last couple of years that we have seen the government agree to the sale of 100 per cent of Qantas. It is only in the last month that we have seen the government prepared to make such provisions in relation to foreign ownership so that the sale might proceed expeditiously with proceeds being appropriately received. The purpose of the bill before us today is to increase the foreign ownership limit that presently exists from 35 of issued capital to 49 per cent, to restrict the individual foreign airlines' holdings to no more than 25 per cent of the issued share capital&mdash;that is what the present act does&mdash;and to restrict foreign airlines in their holdings of the percentage of issued capital of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will increase the total foreign ownership limit for issued capital from the existing 35 per cent up to 49 per cent. It will restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than 35 per cent within that 49 per cent and it will restrict any individual foreign airline from holding no more than 25 per cent of the issued capital of Qantas. The government has put that proposal forward. The opposition is not opposing the bill. Indeed, we support the bill because it accords with the principle that we have always had in relation to privatisation&mdash;namely, that if you really want to have an efficient airline and get the greatest benefit from the very expensive and extensive assets that are tied up in airlines, privatisation is the way to go. There is no reason whatsoever for governments to be in the business of owning and running airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very significant difference in our approach to the rationale of this matter compared to that of the government. There is only one reason why the government is proceeding down this privatisation path. That is because it want to get its hands on the cash that it can raise from the sale of Qantas more quickly than might otherwise be the case so that it can try to fill the gap in its budget. In any case, in my view it will have a hole because the prospect of the government meeting the forecast that it has set itself in the budget for expenditure and revenue is very unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's track record on privatisation over the years is quite appalling. In the year concluding at the end of this month it budgeted for asset sale proceeds of about $2.7 billion. Indeed, it may have been a little higher. The actual expectation of proceeds from asset sales in this financial year is now $55 million. In other words, it has raised virtually nothing compared to the several billion dollars that it planned when it formulated its budget last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year the government came to us with yet another Qantas amendment bill. The purpose of that bill was to extend the date for possible completion of the sale into the 1995-96 budget year. In the course of that debate we said two things that have proven to be totally correct. Firstly, we said that the government could have difficulty finding sufficient local take-up of the float and therefore it may have to return to the parliament to seek further change to the Qantas Sale Act in relation to foreign shareholdings&mdash;in other words, to increase the foreign shareholding permissible. That is precisely what this bill is doing. I do not want to  say, `I told you so' but that is the case if we look at the debates of 30 November 1994 on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Senator Cook is handling this bill at the moment for the government. That is good because I wanted to point out to him the second thing that we said that has proven to be correct. During the debate on 30 November last year I raised the question&mdash;Senator Cook attempted to belittle me on it&mdash;of what would happen to the government's budget for 1994-95 if the sale of Qantas was not completed within the 1994-95 financial year. I also asked what contingency plans the government may have to fill the hole in the budget that would therefore have arisen. The response I got from Senator Cook was that the concern that I had raised about a hole being created in the 1994-95 budget `would not arise.' The fact is that a hole did arise. The sale will not be completed by the end of 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It now looks as if at long last the sale of Qantas, which has been in the government's budget for the fourth successive year, will actually proceed to finality. We certainly hope it will because the government's handling of this issue, going back many years, has been quite appalling. As a result, I believe the government has missed many opportunities that should have been taken for the sale. Ministers were originally talking about the need for the sale of assets such as Qantas as far back as 1989. If we checked the record we would be able to go back further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last six years we have seen a tortuous situation and for the last four to five years we have seen the tortured situation whereby the government has been trying to do things to sell the airline but has handled it so appallingly in a variety of policy areas that the sale has not been possible. We have seen the government chopping and changing its transport policies. The government was involved in tremendous difficulties and backflipping within its own ranks on the whole question of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had the appalling situation where with less than a week's notice the Transport Minister, Laurie Brereton, pulled the pin on air navigation rights and agreements with New Zealand&mdash;a most distressing debacle in terms of relations between our two countries. It has gone on and on and the government has been unable to get its act together in any shape or form. Fortunately it now appears that the circumstances have arisen whereby we may at last see finality in this matter. Certainly from the coalition's point of view, we hope that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons and the rationale behind the government's sale of Qantas is very different from the coalition's. The government wants to get its sticky fingers on some cash. That is really the only thing driving the government's sale of Qantas, which compares very starkly with the reasons why we on this side of the chamber have always supported and argued for the sale. It has been our policy for many years to sell Qantas for very good and proper reasons. There are three main reasons. Firstly, we want to privatise Qantas because we believe that the path of privatisation is the path that leads to the most effective and efficient use of the nation's assets and the maximisation of the benefit to consumers that efficient utilisation of assets brings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as I said before, we believe that the proceeds of privatisation should be used almost exclusively for the retirement of public debt. That is not the case with this government. Indeed, we have seen over the last five years the government's outstanding public debt absolutely skyrocket from a figure of $25 billion to $30 billion to a figure now of about $95 billion. None of the proceeds of the Qantas sale in 1995-96 are going towards the reduction of that very dangerously high level of debt. It is such a high level of debt that the interest bill on it alone exceeds what the government spends on defence and is of the same order as it spends on education. As a result of that squandering by the government, the taxpayers are having to meet interest bills that exceed the total defence budget in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason why we go down the privatisation route&mdash;we regard it as a very important element in any privatisation&mdash;is that we want to increase private savings through the introduction of employee share ownership schemes. I do not know whether the government has any plans which are able to be announced in relation to share ownership schemes. When I asked that question of the minister last year during the debate, he said that no decisions had been taken on share ownership schemes and that decisions were still pending. I hope that in his reply to the contributions by coalition senators to the second reading debate that will be one of the important matters that he takes on board. Indeed, I hope it is a very positive response because if there are no adequate employee share ownership schemes involved in this float, that will be a very significant factor missing from what is otherwise required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to make those points in the debate. As has been said by my colleagues, the coalition supports the bill. We hope that at long last we are nearing the end of this tortuous route towards the final sale of Qantas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on this matter because it is an area of public policy in which I have taken a long interest, probably spanning back to about 1983 or 1984 when I invited to Australia Dr Madsen Pirie from the Adam Smith Institute, who did a lecture tour of Australia. I am not sure whether Senator Cook was actually in the parliament by then but the Labor Party at that time spent a lot of its campaign funds hiring people like Graham Kennedy to lampoon the coalition's nasty idea of selling off the silver to pay the butler and selling off the national jewels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am genuinely pleased that the government has seen, as Senator Short said, both the fiscal imperative of privatisation and the bigger benefits to the economy. Importantly&mdash;and it does not come out in debates about privatisation very often but it should&mdash;if you ensure that you get a higher return on the Commonwealth's own assets, if you have an efficient economy and an efficient public sector economy, of course, the government, as a part of the economy as a whole, is better able to direct its resources and its policy towards helping those who need greater assistance from the Commonwealth government than others. Certainly, that is a very important part of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government would argue&mdash;and I am sure it has been argued at national Labor Party conferences on the last couple of occasions&mdash;that there is no great community benefit derived from the Commonwealth owning an organisation like Qantas and that the money is better spent in other areas. The massive capital injections that are required for a business of the nature of Qantas create a drain on the Commonwealth demand for funds which could be better spent in other areas; the government might even get a better return in other areas. I welcome the shift in the Labor Party's policy in this area. Certainly, we support the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of specific points I want to make about this bill. I want to put on the record something that should be there in relation to the benefits of privatisation and the motivations behind the government's privatisation in this current year's budget, of which Qantas forms a part, as it has in many previous budgets. The Qantas privatisation looks like an aeroplane waiting in one of the long queues at Sydney airport; it is finally going to make it on to the main runway from the taxi runways and it might actually lift off this time. We will give a big cheer when she takes off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable senators on all sides of the chamber&mdash;or just about all sides&mdash;will say to Qantas, James Strong, the employees, the passengers and certainly the shareholders of Qantas, that we hope it will be a very successful float and that Qantas will continue to be one of the great airlines of the world; that it will indeed be a profitable privatised entity; and, importantly for all Australians, that it will be a company and a service which will bring many people from all around the world to our shores so they can spend lots of money in our shops on Australian produced goods, thus improving our current account and allowing our small businesses to flourish as a result of Qantas providing its passengers with a good service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the impact of the proceeds of the privatisation, the government is making much play of the fact that the budget has been put into a $700 million-odd surplus this year; that it will actually reduce demands on Australia's capital markets and therefore reduce pressure on interest rates. It is certainly something that Senator Cook has said in public statements. It is certainly something that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has sold during his selling spree of the budget on radio stations around the country. When people say it will not have any impact on interest rates he says, `No, we're reducing the Commonwealth's call on capital markets by these billions of dollars and therefore the pressure on interest rates will go down.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those who look closely at these things know that privatisations do not necessarily do that. I am actually about halfway through reading former Senator Peter Walsh's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Confessions of a Failed Finance Minister</EMPHASIS>. On Sunday night on the plane I read page 109 where he refers to the effects of privatisation. He puts it in the very crisp, clear and simple language that he is renowned for putting complex economic arguments into, so that even mugs like me can understand. I want to quote it at this stage because he makes the point that just by privatising something you do not necessarily reduce the burden on the capital markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the capital markets need to provide the capital for whoever buys it. I presume, even though I did not do much economics in my tertiary education, that the higher the foreign investment, the lower the call on Australian capital markets. To that extent, this bill might minimise that effect. I quote from former Senator Peter Walsh's book in relation to this matter as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This does not necessarily mean the asset sales are wrong per se, but the argument that they lessen pressure on capital markets and interest rates by reducing the Budget deficit is fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess Peter is calling the Prime Minister, and anyone else who is running that line, fraudulent. I am sure the Prime Minister would not take great offence; I am sure Mr Walsh has called the Prime Minister and previous Labor prime ministers worse than `fraudulent' in his time. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net effect on capital markets of government borrowing to fund a deficit, or private borrowings of the same amount to buy government assets is zero&mdash;or close to it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that point needs to be made. I am sure that that will not feature highly on any discussion of this, but it needs to be understood that the vast bulk of the asset sales in this government's current budget will have very little effect on the demand on Australian capital markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the days since the budget was announced, we have heard in the Senate and in the other place that pressure has come off interest rates as a result of the budget. I would welcome, as I am sure all members of this parliament would welcome, any reduction in the pressure on interest rates, because those people who are most affected on a day-to-day basis&mdash;those people who are repaying their home mortgages, and small businesses which are paying for their working capital&mdash;are indisputably paying some of the highest real interest rates in the world. The latest figures I saw were in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine of about a month ago where an analysis of real interest rates in OECD nations showed that only Canada was pipping us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Cook, since he is in this chamber and is obviously going to respond, that he was wrong when he said in the Senate&mdash;I think it was last week&mdash;that interest rates were higher under the previous Liberal government than they were and are under the Hawke and Keating governments. I ask him quite earnestly to go back and look at the figures for himself. I have had a good look at them both in nominal and real terms. Unfortunately, the ABS figures go back to only 1978, so if the years of 1976 and 1977 distort the figures, then I will stand corrected, as I hope the minister will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, you will find when you analyse real interest rates, as determined by the deflated business lending indicators&mdash;which the parliamentary library will provide you with&mdash;that under the previous Liberal government, real interest rates averaged 4.08 per cent. Under your time in government, real interest rates&mdash;the effective interest rate that affects the competitiveness of our businesses in Australia&mdash;were about 8.8 per cent. That is roughly twice the interest rate burden on business in Australia. I would be very happy if you came back to the Senate and corrected me if I am wrong. I would be even more happy if you came back to the Senate one day and apologised for misleading the Senate about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very important to Australian business. An important consequence of privatisation should be to reduce the Commonwealth's longer term debt burden. As Senator Short said, we believe that the best way to do that is to reduce its recurrent need to fund that debt burden, and use the proceeds of privatisations, such as Qantas, to reduce that public sector debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisation&mdash;this is where I started and this is where I will end&mdash;should always be considered a policy that is not driven by ideology. It was painted as that by the Labor Party in the early 1980s for its political motives. I am glad that it has found other reasons and motives for privatising Qantas&mdash;it needs the money; in this case, to make it look like it has achieved a surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in September 1990 I addressed this issue of  privatisation, particularly the issue of the quantum, or the percentage, of an asset that the government might sell and the effect it would have on the sale price. At that stage, I think that 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank was going to be sold, and 49 per cent of the airline was going to be sold. It struck me at that time&mdash;and I had been around the place for only a few months in September 1990&mdash;that the Commonwealth was probably going to significantly affect the income it would receive from the sales by its decision to sell those small amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the political imperatives on the government: it is easier to go to the national conference and say, `We are just going to sell a little bit of the bank and we will never sell the rest.'

Would he also agree that many of the nations in the South East Asian region have been making rapid progress with privatisation, leaving Australia years behind? Finally, will the doctrinaire, anti-privatisation mindset of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party ensure that Australia misses the opportunity to develop comparative advantage in services, or will the Government pursue a privatisation program to expand opportunities for Australians to develop world competitive service industries?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a different question as to what ought to be done about privatisation issues in Australia. That is the subject of a different debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Commonwealth level, there is still a lot of privatisation, a lot of contracting out and a lot of efficiency gains that can be made. I was most alarmed by what was said at a hearing of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, which met in the suburb of Liverpool some weeks ago to discuss service delivery in the Commonwealth. Witnesses from the Community and Public Sector Union were there.

The more efficiently the public sector is run, the more opportunities this economy will provide for those who do suffer disadvantage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. I think it is an important bill; indeed, in many ways it is quite an historic bill. I would like to record a few remarks and observations. There are a couple of aspects that I would like to draw attention to. It is intriguing to note that Chifley's heirs&mdash;to use the phrase that Mr Hawke used in about 1988&mdash;were not going to privatise the great government authorities, such as Qantas, Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Bank. This bill shows just one of the many rapid changes in philosophy that the Keating Labor Party has had to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the start of the 1980s, things like privatisation, smaller government and lower taxes were totally anathema to the Labor Party. It was interesting that today the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) felt he had to pick up the argument and say how much in favour of smaller government and deregulation the Labor Party is. He beat his chest on that front. Enterprise bargaining was a very dirty concept with the Labor Party in the early and latter parts of the 1980s. Look at the ideas which govern how the economy is managed. Hark back and think about where these ideas have all sprung from. Have they sprung from the bowels of the Labor Party? Have they come from the trade union movement and the philosophies expounded at federal conferences of the Labor Party? The answer is that they have not. The Labor Party, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), was vehemently opposed to privatisation, smaller government and deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What philosophic contribution did the Labor Party make during this period to the economic management of the economy? The only thing that Senator Cook could point to is the accord. It is not so much an innovation and help in policy making but something that effectively represents an area where the Labor Party tried in some ways to cloister the labour market from fully-fledged reforms. It is interesting to speak about the fact that the Labor Party has brought before this chamber a bill to privatise Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brief remarks I wish to make involve a number of issues related to Qantas. I have brought them forward before this chamber in recent years. I am a Victorian senator. What has intrigued me about these great mergers which Mr Keating has driven&mdash;the merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines and the merger of the State Bank and the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;is that there has been a steady stream to my door of former employees or prospective former employees of these institutions. I have said to them on a number of occasions, `I am happy to assist you, but don't you have a trade union movement? Don't you have trade union leaders who are concerned about the particular issues that you raise?' I will not use the exact description that these trade union members have given of their union leaders; it would not be appropriate in a distinguished chamber like this. However, it did lead me to think just how different the Labor Party and the union leaders have become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the old days, the union leaders used to represent employees to the government. In other words, if employees felt they were being put on by their employers and the government, the trade union movement would very strongly make representations to the government. Something very interesting has happened that I wish to record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in relation to the employees and former employees of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank is that trade union leaders represent the government to the employees. In other words, it is the role of the senior trade union officials to attempt to explain to employees why they should support government policy. As a result, the employees who are being displaced&mdash;sometimes in a quite callous way&mdash;as a result of government policies are really finding that they have no-one to speak for them. The very last thing the government and the trade union leaders want is for these employees to cause any problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from Victoria. There have been marches in the streets by the trade unions over the voluntary retrenchments that have been made in the Public Service by the Kennett government. There has not been one march or protest by the trade union leaders over the massive retrenchments by the Commonwealth Bank. About 8,000 individuals are involved, and that number is rising. One journalist spoke to me about this. I said, `Do you have any comments on the trade union leaders and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association?' Apparently they did not wish to comment. It is not that they wanted to march in the streets; they did not even wish to comment. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas are being forced to look elsewhere for people who can provide them with assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something rather important has happened. The Labor Party has dumped all its old philosophy. So it should have; it was from another period. In the old days, the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) and Senator Cook used to get up with their Karl Marx and read the odd extracts. They would feel that this was making a contribution to an understanding of the wider world. That has all changed. We understand that. Good on them; I am all in favour of it. The other big change has been in the trade union movement. The last thing that trade union leaders want to do is lose the government grants, government appointments to jobs and all the perks of office. They do not worry about the trade union members because they are seen as being expendable. Quite a number of trade union leaders do fulfil the traditional role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in two areas&mdash;the Qantas area and the Commonwealth Bank area&mdash;the employees who have spoken to me believe that they have received no comfort from the trade union leaders. In the old days, the trade union leaders were concerned with protecting the employees and, in the case of Commonwealth authorities, representing them to government. Today the situation is different. Trade union leaders have a job to represent the government to the employees and to make sure that the employees do not cause any trouble or embarrassment, particularly in the lead-up to an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something rather important has happened, the full effects of which are being washed through the community. Why are so many people refusing to join trade unions? Why are the trade unions losing members when they have had a government in office for 12 years that has given them every aid and comfort? The reality is that the employees no longer feel that many trade unions are prepared to represent their political interests. I put that on the record, because it is a tragedy when, in relation to a number of these government authorities, very real issues with employees could have been better handled had the trade union leadership been more vigorous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the further example of Comcar. The TWU was on a promise from the government that it would not make any changes to Comcar. Apparently, that promise was junked within four weeks of the election. We have now had fairly widespread retrenchments of Comcar drivers. Many are pending in the next few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcar drivers have spoken to me. I have asked, `What is your trade union doing? What is the TWU doing? It is on a promise from government to protect your jobs.' Frankly, it is questionable whether such a promise should have been made. I have asked, `Why is it not making a fuss in the press about this?' The reality is that the job of the top people at the TWU is not to represent the interests of Comcar drivers to the government but to tell Comcar drivers to keep quiet and do what they are told. They say that they have made the best possible deal and that, for heavens sake, the drivers should not make a public fuss about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I bring to the attention of the Senate those three particular government bodies in which I have had some contact with the employees. In each case the employees are fed up with the trade union leaders. My final and concluding comment is that I have attempted through Senate estimates, questions on notice and other processes to follow just what is happening with employees in relation to Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I will speak briefly in relation to this document. This document is in relation to article 19 of the ILO constitution. The Australian government is required to submit the text of new conventions and recommendations to the competent authority&mdash;the Australian parliament. So this is one particular area&mdash;that is, the International Labour Organisation&mdash;where there is an automatic submission to the parliament before adoption. For adoption there must be two-thirds majority of the tripartite International Labour Conference. The purpose of this convention is to provide protection to part-time workers so that their working conditions are the same as or at least equivalent to those of comparable full-time workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic importance of part-time work and the need for employment policies to take into account the role of part-time work in facilitating additional employment opportunities must be recognised. This is from the text, but it is extremely important in relation to Australia's situation. The Australian position in relation to this convention so far is that the ACTU has indicated that the government should support ratification of the convention. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has presented a preliminary view that there would be no obstacles to the ratification of the convention. However, it is looking at the complexity of some of the matters and it is still considering its options. I would like to think that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry does, out of principle, support the fact that part-time workers do deserve some protection of their standards of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an overview presented of the current trends in Australia and it would not take much to see that there is a growth in the part-time work force. The major impetus has been mentioned to come from a combination of the intensification of competitive pressures, special demand and working conditions and the introduction of new technology. We know that there are lots of areas, our service industry in particular, where we go in and find that there are people specifically employed, for instance, for lunchtime only. There is no carryover. They do not necessarily work through the day. They are employed specifically to service customers at lunchtime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say that growth in the part-time work force assists the government in helping to fudge unemployment statistics. Often it means that the government can talk about the number of jobs. People might be in part-time jobs to survive or to pay their mortgage. Some people might have to have two or three jobs. The reality is also that, when you have a greater percentage of people on part-time jobs, you are not necessarily talking about an increase in welfare across the community. You might be talking about a part-time job which a person may, under such things as case management, be forced to take which does not actually increase their financial circumstances to any great degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part-time work is of particular importance to women, who make up the majority of part-time workers and workers with family responsibilities. There is a high participation of women in part-time work. This is a major factor in women's lower average earning compared to men. This is one factor which must be taken into consideration later when we are talking about the implications of compulsory superannuation contributions. What will be the impact in the long run of superannuation benefits once a person has retired? If the statistics clearly show, as we know they do, that women are much more likely to be in part-time or casual work, then it is obvious that the benefits of superannuation payments will be less. Of course, this is made worse by the fact that the government's contribution is less, depending on how much you are earning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a regulating framework, but there is a problem sometimes in implementing this. The limited availability of permanent part-time employment under awards is mentioned. It is quite difficult to actually get a recognition of permanent part-time work. There is a failure of some awards and agreements to confine casual employment to employment which is short term, irregular or seasonal. There are relatively high weekly hours, a requirement for permanent part-time employment in some awards and agreements which may have forced some employees into casual employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been, however, a number of developments during the 1980s and 1990s. It seems that there are some improvements. However, casual employment has important disadvantages which may justify award based or other limitations on its use. It is a very insecure form of employment and it is not generally associated with many of the award benefits which are associated with other forms of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see in Australia, according to the report, is large scale and long-term casualisation combined with limited scope for movement into the permanent work force which could threaten the achievement of objectives such as improving the overall level of skill in the work force, encouraging lifelong skill acquisition and promoting equal employment opportunity. It should be worked in for the fact that most people on this type of work are less likely to be members of a union because of the nature of the work and, therefore, are doubly disadvantaged. It is very necessary for Australia to ratify this treaty and I trust that there will at least be some debate about the benefits of doing so. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to continue a speech which I began last week and which concerns the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and its lack of care in the preparation of materials that it put on the Australian market and which were used for the treatment of large numbers of human patients. Tonight I wish to speak about the disease CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This is a disease with a spontaneous incidence of about one per million of the population. In the approximately 2,600 people who have received pituitary hormones prepared by the CSL there have already been four cases of CJD. As this is a disease with a very long incubation period, it is almost certain that other cases will appear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Knowledge of diseases of this general class began to appear in the 1930s with knowledge of the transmissibility of scrapie, a disease of sheep. In 1934-35 a vaccine prepared against another disease of sheep, louping ill, was used in the United Kingdom to vaccinate sheep. The vaccine was prepared from the brains and spleens of sheep and was treated with formalin to sterilise it and to ensure that it did not transmit any disease. This was and still is a standard procedure. While the sheep that received the vaccine were protected from louping ill, some 18 months to 2 years later they began to develop scrapie. In short, a vaccine which had been correctly prepared, in which the active agent had been successfully killed and which conferred proper immunity as intended nonetheless transmitted another fatal neurological disease in an unexpected manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1936 French research showed that scrapie could be transmitted from sheep to goats. Thus, 30 years before CSL put human pituitary hormones prepared from human pituitary glands collected at autopsies into the marketplace, we began to collect knowledge of a class of infectious neurological diseases which were transmissible, which were caused by a presumed virus and in which the infectious particle was resistant to formalin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the disease of `kuru' has afflicted some of the tribes in New Guinea. The work of Gadjusec and others in Australia in the late 1950s and early 1960s showed that this was also caused by what came to be known as a slow virus. Kuru was transmitted through the eating of human nervous tissue. There was a long latency between the eating of this material and the appearance of the symptoms, but once these appeared there was a steady and inexorable progression of mental deterioration leading to death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1958 Gadjusec was working on kuru in Australia. He visited England and saw some of the work on scrapie. He published work on kuru in 1959 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS>. By 1963 kuru was shown to be a transmissible disease and the agent responsible for its transmission was shown to be resistant, not only to formalin but ultraviolet light, phenols and autoclaving. Recognising that CJD in humans caused very similar changes in the brain to both scrapie in sheep and kuru in humans he placed CJD in the same general class of diseases. Some of the work on kuru was done in the CSL laboratories. CSL scientists at the time were therefore well aware of the work going on kuru, the infectious nature of the causative agent and the nature of the disease process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1966 CJD had been shown to be a transmissible disease and by 1970 CJD had been transmitted in the laboratory to a range of other primates.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sets the background against which CSL entered the business of preparing human pituitary hormones for the treatment of human diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the early 1960s it was known that there was a group of transmissible infectious agents, affecting nervous tissue, brain and spinal cord, and in which the active disease appeared many years or decades after first infection. Moreover, the agents responsible for these diseases were very resistant to all the normal sterilising agents and there was no treatment for any of these diseases once they manifested themselves. The diseases were then fairly rapidly progressive with death as the inevitable result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was extremely likely that there would be other diseases discovered which would show similar characteristics. One can never be sure that all the diseases of a particular class have been discovered and characterised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1963 CSL was asked to investigate the manufacture of pituitary hormones. These had been made on a small and experimental scale by individuals working out of university laboratories. Three of the many pituitary hormones were of particular interest: growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. The latter two are responsible for stimulating the formation and ripening of the Graafian or egg follicle in the ovary and the formation of the corpus luteum which maintains a pregnancy. The use of these two had been shown to be effective in treating some cases of infertility in women. Growth hormone had been shown to be effective in stimulating the growth of stunted children. Once the effectiveness of treatment with these hormones became known there was a push by both doctors and patients to make them generally available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work at CSL was undertaken. The bulk production of these hormones involved the collection of pituitary glands from human cadavers, the making up of a batch of such glands, and the extraction of the hormones from these batches. As it turned out some 1,300 glands were combined before the extraction process was applied. Thus it was likely that the inclusion of a single gland which was infected with one of the slow virus agents would have infected the whole batch. Also, it would be essentially impossible to sterilise either the batch or any of the separated hormones. And by the very nature of these agents it was impossible to tell whether any particular pituitary gland was infected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all common sense and does not depend on the wisdom of hindsight. As a consequence of this commonsense conclusion a prominent scientist advised the Department of Health in 1965 not to allow CSL to proceed with the preparation and distribution of hormones from human pituitary glands. Nonetheless, CSL went ahead with the blessing of the Commonwealth department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must now turn to the method of preparation of the hormones from the batches of pituitary glands. After maceration and other steps the separation of the three hormones of interest was achieved by chromatography, specifically by gel filtration. This involves applying the mixture to the top of a column of gel and allowing the material to run through the gel. The different fractions run through at different rates and emerge from the bottom of the column at different times. These different fractions can thus be collected. Now it was known that the virus fraction would run through the column the quickest and would be the first fraction collected. It seems that CSL assumed that the separations would be so complete that the later fractions, which contained the hormones of interest, would therefore be virus free. But no separation by column chromatography is so complete and it is quite clear that some virus would remain attached to the gel and the glassware, thus contaminating every fraction which emerged from the column later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again in 1965 a prominent scientist advised the Department of Health that because viruses would elute first every later fraction collected from the column would be contaminated and that therefore sterility of any of the hormones used for hormone injection could not be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary then we had a situation in which no pituitary gland could be guaranteed free from the carriage of slow viruses, which we now know to be prions; even smaller and more difficult to detect than viruses. We know that at the time of the start of CSL's large scale manufacture of pituitary hormones we had good knowledge of several `viruses'&mdash;prions&mdash;capable of causing severe rapidly fatal neurological disease but with a long latency and we knew that these infectious agents was remarkably resistant to all the usual sterilants used in the preparation of vaccines and other biological products for injection into humans. And we know that some scientists had put these fact together and advised against the manufacture of human pituitary hormones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The making and distribution of pituitary hormones began in the mid-1960s and continued to the mid-1980s. The company went ahead despite the warnings and despite the commonsense conclusion that should have been drawn regarding the risks based on the evidence available at the time. It also seems that no microbiologist was employed on the production line of the human pituitary hormones. Is it surprising that we have now seen cases of CJD appearing in the recipients of these products? Of course it is not!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL has now been sold. The sale was accompanied by a prospectus and an indemnity regarding past actions. Did the prospectus reveal the possibility of legal action against CSL? And how far does the indemnity protect CSL from actions which many, one might say most, would regard as not just unfortunate or unpredictable outcomes of actions taken in good faith and with proper precautions given the state of knowledge at the time, but actions which were negligent and well below any reasonable standard of scientific and medical care given the knowledge that was clearly available at the time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL was not observing a code of good manufacturing practice. But more than that, it was ignoring the risks to the recipients of its products, risks which any reasonably competent scientist working in this field could reasonably have foreseen. The risks were foreseen, the Commonwealth Department of Health was advised not to proceed with the preparation, yet the department and CSL went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal challenge to CSL and the government is being prepared. It is quite unfair that private litigants should be saddled with the whole expense of sorting out the role of government and government agencies in this mess to say nothing of the possibility that the present privatised CSL still carries some of the blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole episode goes to the very heart of the proper responsibility of government, of the proper discharge of that responsibility. It must be investigated by a Senate committee. I shall be moving in that direction shortly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise some concerns that the Australian Democrats have and which were placed on the record this morning in our dissent to the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the Competition Policy Reform Bill. That bill raises a fundamental issue of process as well as a number of substantive concerns. The competition policy agenda incorporates a radical rethinking of the role of government and government services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rethink has occurred within a narrow ideological framework based on the concept that competition, just like greed, is good at all times. There has been inadequate public debate on what this agenda means, where it is leading and why this narrow framework should be imposed on the provision of community services, the furthering of ecological sustainability, improving consumer protection, health and safety or the promotion of social equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues were not being adequately debated, in public or in parliament, before the COAG agreement was signed. Most of the detail of the government's agenda is contained in the three agreements signed at COAG in April. The Democrats foreshadow that, in an attempt to broaden the debate over the impact of the implementation of the government's agenda, we will be moving to set up a parliamentary inquiry to look at the agreements and how they will be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters in the Competition Policy Reform Bill raise particular concerns and amendments concerning these matters are under consideration. I will address them briefly. The first is the definition of public service. Clause 75 of the bill seeks, in proposed section 2C, to define what government activities do or do not constitute a business activity. This section may need to be amended to further clarify what is or is not business to ensure that core services such as health, education, welfare, employment and environmental protection programs are clearly excluded. Otherwise, we could be legitimising heading down the Victorian local government road, in which everything from library services to swimming pools is regarded as a business to be run on a user pays basis, without regard to the public benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern is about the access regime. Proposed part IIIA establishes the access regime for infrastructure. However, in establishing a right to access for private providers, it fails to guarantee the provision of quality services to all users of the infrastructure. With cherry picking of the most profitable aspects of the facility for contracting out, the public sector provider could be forced to provide unprofitable services at higher costs to the taxpayer and to the disadvantage of consumers who are apparently to be deprived of cross-subsidisation and community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is clearly unsatisfactory and provision needs to be made to avoid such developments or, at the very least, to address the consequences of the action proposed. This applies in particular to people living in regional and remote areas and to measures needed to protect Australia's natural environment, a need which is likely to be ignored or neglected in a situation of free-for-all competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue I wish to address is local government. While it is represented at COAG, the local government sector is not party to the agreements. There remains a serious and legitimate concern in local government that competition policy will be implemented by the states to the detriment of the local government sector. Those in Victoria would be familiar with the cavalier treatment meted out to local government in that state. The federal government must require the states to adequately consult with local government, with a view to reaching agreement, before implementing any aspect of competition policy reform. The bill may have to be amended to ensure this. Finally, there is the issue of representation. The proposed composition of the National Competition Council is in need of review. At the very least, provision needs to be made for the inclusion of a consumer representative. </PARA>

That is the company involved in the chaotic and disastrous redevelopment plan for part of Sussex Street. It is involved in that plan with the AWU-FIME, which also has financial problems, and the Seamen's Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I outlined the fact that eventually, after breaching the ASC requirements, the Labor Party's subsidiary had come out with its financial accounts for the 12 months to December 1993&mdash;about six to eight weeks ago&mdash;and revealed a deficit of shareholders' funds of $2.2 million, with current liabilities of $3.8 million and total assets of only $1.6 million. When these financial accounts were filed about eight weeks ago, the group also filed the 1991 and 1992 accounts&mdash;almost three years late. That also is in breach of Securities Commission requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These accounts were filed only when the Securities Commission began undertaking deregistration action against the Labor Party's subsidiary for failing to meet the requirements of the law. The problem seems to start from the very top. The piggery companies of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could never meet the requirements of the Corporations Law. The New South Wales ALP is incapable of meeting the requirements of the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned this morning that Mr John Della Bosca wrote to the Australian Securities Commission saying that the financial data could not be provided earlier as no commitment could be given to sign the accounts because, ultimately, the control of the company rested with the voluntary officials.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992 the ASC had written to Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd saying it wanted to know whether the company was still in operation because the ASC had not received any reports, reports that were required by law. Mr John Della Bosca, on 15 September 1992, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are currently experiencing administrative difficulties affecting the company's accounting and secretarial functions. We are addressing these issues but I believe it will take six months to be in a position to lodge annual returns.</PARA>
<PARA>Those secretarial difficulties certainly lasted a long time. The financial accounts did not come in in six months time, in the middle of 1993, but in the fourth month of 1995. I am intrigued by this persistent breaching of the Corporations Law. This Labor Party subsidiary did not have an annual general meeting as required by law. We do not know whether the accounts it did file had been audited. There is no indication that they had been, although the company said it had appointed an auditor. Apart from those messes, what is intriguing is the ALP's Sydney building in Sussex Street. It bought the disaster in 1990 for $3.8 million. Property experts, accordingly to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a couple of days ago, now value it at around $1.5 million. </PARA>

The financial report released by a former FIME official recently revealed that the union had debts of over $17 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the New South Wales Labor Party is technically bankrupt and is being kept afloat by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&mdash;for one reason or another which I have never been able to work out&mdash;and the Commonwealth Bank, as I understand it, has paid off $10,000 a week just to meet its interest bill. But what about the financial situation of the AWU-FIME with this huge debt? I understand that in Queensland, in particular, various employees of the union have been advised that the union intends to divert funds that have been provided for the future benefit of retiring employees, particularly by way of long service leave, into paying some of the current operating debts of the AWU-FIME. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the federal Labor Party would not like to see that sort of thing happen to its industrial wing. I wonder what sort of control the Department of Industrial Relations has over this kind of diversion of what are supposed to be future benefits for retiring employees by way of long service leave. Is it possible for the department to prevent this money being diverted by this union?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it the union appears to be plundering the future retirement benefits of employees to pay what I understand is $3 million as part of the union's huge debts. I understand that many of those debts consist of telephone and credit card bills which have been run up by the union's head office in Sydney. The Queensland employees of the union are not too impressed by anything south of the border&mdash;particularly rugby league teams&mdash;and are certainly not impressed that, because the amalgamated union of the AWU and the FIME is apparently incapable of running itself officially, their retirement incomes are being put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know if any minister is specifically in charge of these matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen many instances where employees of unions have had to take action in the Industrial Relations Court against their employers. We have a fascinating situation where perhaps some of the worst employers are union officials. We have already seen that the piggery of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was a terrible employer in that it breached award wages on at least three occasions. It seems to me that the Labor movement's industrial or political wing cannot meet the industrial relations law or the Corporations Law. It is consistently in breach of ASC requirements.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Albatrosses spend the bulk of their lives at sea, returning to land only to breed. Twelve countries, including Australia, have jurisdiction over the breeding grounds but the migratory range of albatrosses includes the territorial waters of many other countries and the high seas. There are world-wide reports of a sustained decline in many of the albatross populations (eg. Weimerskirch, H. and Jouventin, P. (1987) Journal of Animal Ecology 56:1043-1055; Croxall, J.P. (1991) Reproductive Constraints on Albatrosses 20th International Ornithological Congress. 1:281-302; and Garnett, S. (1992) The Action Plan for Australian Birds. Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service) and capture on the baited hooks used in longline tuna fishing is considered the major cause (eg. Brothers, N.P. (1991) Albatross mortality and associated bait loss in the Japanese longline fishery in the Southern Ocean Biological Conservation 55:255-268; and Croxall 1991).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Direct mortality in association with commercial fishing has been documented for 12 of the 14 species. It is this fisheries-related mortality that has been implicated in the decline of albatross populations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understanding the nature and magnitude of albatross bycatch associated with commercial fisheries is in its early stages. In 1989, it was estimated that the Japanese component of the Southern Bluefin tuna fishery worldwide had incidentally taken 44 000 albatrosses per year. Since then fishing effort has virtually halved and mitigation measures have been introduced, although the initial analysis has not been repeated. There are no data regarding high seas or domestic tuna longline fisheries of other nations (eg Indonesia, Korea Taiwan or the USA) although each of these fisheries is reported to "catch birds" in association with tuna longline activity. There are no data available on the incidental catch of albatrosses by the Australian domestic tuna longlining fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other threats to populations of albatross include ingestion of plastic particles at sea, oil (leading to loss of thermoregulatory ability), threats to breeding habitat (eg by trampling, predation of eggs and chicks&mdash;particularly cats and rats), tourism, extreme climatic conditions and the avian pox virus (Gales, R. (1993) Cooperative Mechanisms for the Conservation of Albatross Australian Nature Conservation Agency, Project No. 148). There are no data to indicate what percentage of the decline in albatross numbers can be attributed to these causes although anecdotal evidence suggests that these threats are likely to be insignificant compared to longline fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Generally, the area from 3 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles offshore (known as the Australian fishing zone) is the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The management of Commonwealth fisheries falls within the Portfolio of the Minister for Resources. Commonwealth fisheries are administered by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) and policy matters and international fisheries access arrangements are negotiated on behalf of Australia by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the States and Territories have fisheries responsibilities for inland waters and for waters between the low water mark and 3 nautical miles offshore. Under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement it is possible for one Government to have responsibility for the management of a total fishery (outside the jurisdictional areas described above) in order to rationalise the management of that fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Over their entire geographic range, population declines have been demonstrated for six of the fourteen species of albatrosses (Gales, 1993). The species for which this has been documented are: Diomeden exulans (Wandering Albatross), D. nigripes (Black-footed Albatross), D. melanophris (Black-browed Albatross), D. cauta (Shy Albatross), D. chrysostoma (Grey-headed Albatross) and Phoebetria fusca (Sooty Albatross). These species are considered to be threatened. Two species are considered to be endangered (D. albatrus and D. amsterdamensis). The population status of three species is unknown (D. bulleri (Bullers Albatross), D.chlororynchus (Yellow-nosed Albatross) and P. palpebrata (Light-mantled Sooty Albatross)). Direct mortality in association with commercial fishing operations has been documented for 12 of the 14 species (nb. D. irrorata (Waved Albatross) and D. albatrus (Short-tailed Albatross) are not recorded as being associated with tuna longline fisheries).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australian waters Garnett (1992), in the Action Plan for Australian Birds, recommends listing D. exulans chionoptera (Wandering Albatross&mdash;Macquarie Island sub-species), as endangered and D. chrysostoma (Grey-headed Albatross) as vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Federal Government is undertaking a range of cooperative measures to address this problem. I have asked the Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) to ensure continued funding for research into measures to address the documented decline in albatross numbers due to tuna longline fisheries. ANCA is currently providing the second year of funding for a three year project to the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Heritage. Dr Nigel Brothers and Dr Rosemary Gales are working jointly on this project to investigate the conservation status of albatrosses in Australian waters and the nature and the extent of the albatross-fishery interaction. Their work includes development of mitigation measures and cooperative links to encourage use of these deterrent devices both within Australia's fishing zone and, importantly, on the high seas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past three years ANCA has allocated some $270 000 to this work. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) has contributed over $300 000 from the Bilateral Japan Australia) Access fee and industry contribution, and the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Land Management has contributed some $50 000, as well as the full time resources of Dr Brothers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Antarctic Division, within my Portfolio will co-host the first International Conference of the Conservation of Albatrosses in August 1995 in collaboration with the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Land Management. Delegates will attend from South America, South Africa, New Zealand, North America, South America, United Kingdom, Japan and Australia. A workshop to examine the interaction between albatrosses and tuna longline fisheries will be held immediately following the Conference to discuss the global issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its last meeting in Hobart the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) adopted a new Conservation Measure which will require mandatory mitigation measures to be used to reduce the incidental mortality of seabirds during fishing operations in CCAMLR waters (south of 60 degrees S). This Conservation Measure became binding on all Parties (with the exception of France and South Africa who entered reservations) on 7 May 1995. Australian scientists contributed significantly to the development of these conservation measures and were active in pushing for its adoption during the Conference of Parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Convention on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, a trilateral treaty between Australia, Japan and New Zealand ratified in 1994, establishes an Ecologically Related Species Working Group which will examine, among other things, the issue of incidental take of seabirds by tuna longline fisheries. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has the lead in these negotiations and seeks input from AFMA, ANCA, other Government Departments and non-government organisations in preparing its position. Australia has been pushing very strongly for this group to consider experimental testing of the effectiveness of various mitigation measures which will reduce the incidental take of seabirds by tuna longline fisheries operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From November 1995, the use of bird scaring devices (tori poles) will be made mandatory in the Australian fishing zone for all Japanese tuna longline vessels fishing south of 30 degrees S.
