The ban was in response to the security problems posed by the very large number of demonstrators moving around the building on Thursday of last week. The Speaker and I directed that visitors to the private areas of Parliament House should not be issued with unaccompanied passes. The direction has since been rescinded.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Despite claims by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Resources and you that the fault lies with the states that the national forest policy statement has not been implemented, is it not correct that since 1993 the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Fahey, has written to the Prime Minister three times and the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, twice requesting guidance, to no avail, in the formulation of the environmental criteria necessary for the states to undertake regional forest assessment? Doesn't this correspondence from these state governments confirm Senator Collins's view that the fault lies with the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories? What is your response to this?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of the increased emphasis on regional forest agreements in the Prime Minister's announcement, the release of a Commonwealth position on RFAs is a very high priority. In fact, the paper has been developed over the last 18 months by the relevant Commonwealth departments. It is a matter of just days until this paper is released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that, although release of the paper has been delayed, that in itself is not an impediment to progressing RFAs with the states. The fact that RFAs have not been progressed represents and is caused by the attitude of the states themselves. The government has expressed a very keen desire to work with the states to develop regional forest agreements. The Commonwealth can only become involved when it is acted to participate. To date, only Queensland has invited the Commonwealth to participate in comprehensive assessments of south-east Queensland with a view to progressing a regional forest agreement for that particular region. Where a state has expressed an interest in negotiating an RFA for specific regions, as has Victoria with the Central Highlands, the Commonwealth, of course, has responded. Discussions have been going on with Victoria at officer level to reach agreement to proceed to a regional forest agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to progressing regional forest agreements and also the necessary assessments that will need to be put in place to underpin regional forest agreements. The collection of data and assessment of forest values&mdash;such as old-growth, national estate, biodiversity values&mdash;are preliminary steps that provide baseline data for the negotiation of RFAs. But really and truly, the most recalcitrant of the states has been New South Wales, and I believe that is recognised not only by the Commonwealth but certainly also by the other state governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Boswell's question is: no, that is not the case.

I believe that you will see those who are interested in protecting Australia's native forests and have a commitment to conservation supporting this process, as will the industry, the unions, the community and other stakeholders.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hon. Paul Keating, MP</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your recent letter concerning the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS). You have asked whether the New South Wales Government will fully back the establishment of the policy advisory body, as agreed in the NFPS, and whether it will continue to support the NFPS generally. You have also noted that funds have been made available to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to assist the States in the assessment of forests for conservation values, including old growth and wilderness, under the NFPS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Government endorsed the NFPS on the basis that it would provide a framework for consultation between the States and the Commonwealth on issues affecting the ecologically sustainable use and management of forest resources. My Government will continue to support the NFPS on the condition that it fulfils this function. Accordingly, on this condition, the New South Wales Government supports the establishment of the policy advisory body as agreed under the NFPS. This advisory body should provide a means for stakeholders to convey their views on forestry and conservation issues to governments within that consultative framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as you have noted, there are some concerns regarding the Commonwealth's intentions with respect to the NFPS. I share these concerns and suggest they may threaten the continued support of my Government for the NFPS if not resolved. In particular, I am concerned at the prescriptive and unilateral manner in which the NFPS has been invoked by your colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories in her undated letters to my Ministerial colleagues. I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Conservation and Land Management, the Hon. G.B. West, M.P., that your Minister's request for a moratorium on wood production activities in areas she contends have a high conservation value would affect some 1.4 million hectares of forest in New South Wales, resulting in a 52% reduction in the annual sustainable timber yield from State forests. This would have unacceptable consequences for the timber industry and rural economies. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, I am advised by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, the Hon. C.P. Hartcher, M.P., that the list of areas of forests likely to have high conservation value old growth or wilderness is misleading and overstates reserve requirements. For example, I am advised that several of the areas included have already been examined by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service for wilderness values and have been found to be unsuitable for declaration as wilderness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, my Government seeks clarification from the Commonwealth on its intentions with respect to the NFPS objectives dealing with the protection of old growth and wilderness forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that NSW already has in place measures to ensure the protection of the conservation values of forests, including old growth and wilderness values. In particular, the Timber Industry (Interim Protection) Act 1991 places a moratorium on logging in old growth forests identified in the New South Wales Government's 1990 Old Growth Forest Strategy pending the completion and determination of environmental impact statements (EIS) under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act also excludes logging from wilderness nomination areas which had not previously been the subject of an EIS. Further, the Wilderness Act 1987 provides for the nomination and assessment of areas for wilderness values and NSW is currently involved in the assessment of a number of wilderness nomination areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will also be aware that the NFPS contemplates the accreditation of State processes under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE) and that the Commonwealth is to give full faith and credit to the results of accredited State processes when exercising its own responsibilities under the NFPS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, as a matter of urgency, my Government seeks accreditation by the Commonwealth under the IGAE of the State environmental assessment processes provided for under the Timber Industry (Interim Protection) Act 1991 and the Wilderness Act 1987 for the purposes of the NFPS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the matter of Commonwealth funding to assist the States in the assessment of forests for conservation values, my Government is prepared to negotiate with the Commonwealth on funding arrangements for forest assessments. However, such arrangements should not pre-empt the orderly implementation of the NFPS. Specifically, funding arrangements should be made in the light of your Government's consideration of the accreditation of the above mentioned State processes. Further, as agreed by governments under the NFPS, the commencement of any new assessment processes for the purposes of the NFPS is contingent upon the satisfactory agreement by the Commonwealth and the States on criteria for the assessment of the conservation values of forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to raise with you the status of the 1990 Commonwealth/State Agreement on the South East Forests in the context of the NFPS. As you will be aware, this Agreement provides for the dedication by my Government of some 55,000 hectares of conservation reserves over State forests and other Crown land on the basis of the results of a joint Commonwealth/State scientific report on the region. In return, your Government is to provide resource security arrangements and industry restructuring assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand the Agreement has been the subject of officer level negotiations between the Commonwealth and NSW and my Government is now ready to proceed to finalise the Agreement at Ministerial level. However, I was concerned to note that areas listed for exclusion from logging by your Minister included areas which had been determined as available for wood production under the Agreement. This threatens the very basis of the Agreement and risks undermining the cooperative and consultative spirit adopted by both our Governments in negotiating the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, my Government also seeks confirmation from the Commonwealth that the assessment procedures and proposed dedication of conservation reserves under the South East Forests Agreement satisfies the requirements of the NFPS for that region in terms of the establishment of a "comprehensive, adequate and representative reservation system" for publicly owned old growth forests and forested wilderness.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to inform you of my Government's views on how best to progress the implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the NFPS acknowledges the importance of a comprehensive, adequate and representative network of dedicated and secure nature conservation reserves for forests and reserves for the protection of forested wilderness. The signatory Governments have agreed to review the appropriateness of the existing reserve system and determine whether any further action is required to complete its development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this commitment, the Governments have agreed to a strategy to ensure the existence of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for areas of old growth forests and forested wilderness ("the CAR reserve system").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the first step in this, data needs to be collected and assessments made on the old growth and wilderness values of forests. In accordance with the provisions of the NFPS, the assessments are to commence after Governments have reached agreement on reserve assessment criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NFPS also provides for a comprehensive regional assessment process for forested areas involving the collection and evaluation of information on environmental and heritage aspects of forests in a region ("the CRA process"). This process would provide the basis for a regional agreement relating to Commonwealth and State obligations for forests in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NFPS does not explicitly provide that the review of the CAR reserve system and the CRA process be jointly progressed. However, in order to reduce duplication and uncertainty, it would clearly be sensible for this to occur. This joint procedure should involve the following steps:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to begin, data collection activities for the purposes of reviewing the CAR reserve system would proceed jointly with data collection for the CRA process;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.next, this data would be evaluated for purpose of the CRA process&mdash;part of this evaluation would be the assessment of values of old growth forests and forested wilderness to review the CAR reserve system;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the CRA process would then produce an intergovernmental regional agreement including, inter alia, decisions on the CAR reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already written to you on the need for socio-economic considerations to be taken into account in the review of the CAR reserve system. Under the National Ecologically Sustainable Development Strategy, our Governments agreed that all values, including environmental and socio-economic values, must be effectively integrated into decision-making on land and resource use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am, however, concerned that the CRA process as provided for under the NFPS appears to be limited to environmental and heritage values and does not incorporate socio-economic values. This would make it difficult for the ensuing agreement to accommodate all Government obligations, such as obligations relating to regional employment and investment. Accordingly, the CRA process in its totality, and not just that component relating to the review of the CAR reserve system, must explicitly incorporate socio-economic considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As already mentioned, the first action in implementing the above is the collection of data on all values of forests on a regional basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are aware that my Government has established the Natural Resources Audit Council (NRAC) to collect information on all of the values of public land and natural resources on a regional basis. This information will assist the Government in making land and resource use and allocation decisions, including decisions relating to forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NRAC is therefore well placed to be the State's data collection agency for the purposes of the CRA process, including coordinating data collection activities for old growth and forested wilderness for the review of the CAR reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my letter of 16 September, I invited the Commonwealth to participate in the development of the regional data collection procedures to be followed by NRAC. It is hoped that this will facilitate the accommodation within those procedures of Commonwealth responsibilities, including obligations relating to forests, from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, in the interests of ensuring that Commonwealth responsibilities are met, my Government has requested the Commonwealth to accredit NRAC's processes under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have given NRAC, as its first reference for a Regional Audit, the Upper North East of New South Wales. As part of its Audit, NRAC will collect information on all of the values of forested public land. This will include the coordination by NRAC of data collection on the old growth and wilderness values of forests on public lands in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The data collected by NRAC could form the basis of assessments of values of old growth forests and forested wilderness for the Upper North East region for the purposes of the CRA process. As outlined above, those assessments would be used for, amongst other things, decisions on the review of the CAR reserve system in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sequence of events&mdash;whereby NRAC collects data, which is then input into the old growth and wilderness assessments for the CRA process, which then result in decisions on the CAR reserve system&mdash;would occur first in the forests in the Upper North East region of New South Wales. This is appropriate, given that the greatest need for forest data exists in that region. This sequence of events would be repeated across the State as NRAC progressively conducts further Regional Audits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, the assessments and decisions for the purposes of the review of the CAR reserve system will not be able to be made until the reserve assessment criteria are agreed by Governments. Nevertheless, some data collection activities for the Upper North East region can proceed immediately, to feed into the NRAC Regional Audit and to advance the objectives of the NFPS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand from your previous correspondence that the Commonwealth has offered funds to NSW to carry out data collection activities as required under the NFPS. I have directed the relevant State agencies to now apply for those funds, to be used initially in the Upper North East as part of NRAC's first Regional Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I anticipate that some of the funds will be used to finance surveys of the old growth values of the North East forests. These surveys will further refine and verify the methodology developed by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to identify and delineate old growth forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I wish to draw your attention to provisions in the NFPS which require Governments to take interim measures to "avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high  conservation value." These interim measures would remain in place until the completion of the assessment of forests for conservation values, which, as discussed earlier, should proceed in conjunction with the CRA process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the NSW Government has already halted logging in specified areas of old growth forest under the Timber Industry (Interim Protection) Act 1991. This Act places an interim moratorium on logging in old growth forests identified in the Government's 1990 Old Growth Forest Strategy pending the completion and determination by the Minister for Planning of environmental impact statements (EIS) under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Timber Industry (Interim Protection) Act also excludes logging from wilderness nominations which had not previously been the subject of an EIS. The Government is currently involved in the consideration of a number of wilderness nominations under the Wilderness Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be remembered that the NFPS provides that "Australia will continue to use old growth timber for many years". The Statement represents an attempt to balance forest conservation and development considerations in accordance with the principles of Ecologically Sustainable Development. Indeed, as your own Ministers Cook and Evans have now acknowledged, the NFPS was never meant to impose a moratorium on logging in all old growth forests and forested wilderness areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Government will continue to avoid logging activities in certain old growth forests and forested wilderness areas which are likely to have high conservation value pending the completion of assessments of forests for conservation values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the above clarifies the NSW Government's views regarding implementation of the NFPS.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA  ACT  2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing concerning the need for progress on the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and regarding your letter of 15 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your statement placed importance on the need to negotiate Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs). You will be aware that the preparation of RFAs is predicated on completion of comprehensive regional assessments (CRAs). There are, however, significant impediments attributable to the Commonwealth, preventing meaningful progress with undertaking CRAs. The most notable of these relates to the absence of an agreed methodology for the required CRA survey and analytical work, and doubt about the status and prospects of accreditation of existing State processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CRA process has been the subject of considerable correspondence between the Commonwealth and NSW, including an exchange of letters between us. Before States can initiate work which would contribute towards the CRA process, an agreed methodology needs to be available, as does advice on the accreditation status of existing State environmental assessment processes and data bases. This point was made clear, as early as my letter of 16 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 8 June 1994, the Acting Premier also wrote to you in response to an invitation to comment on the Commonwealth's discussion paper on CRAs. He indicated that it was not acceptable for the Commonwealth to prescribe the terms of CRAs and not seriously address the issue of accreditation of State processes or respond to significant concerns raised about the methodology proposed for future surveys or analytical work. Advice received from NSW Government agencies indicates that the Commonwealth, through your Department, had planned to circulate a revised methodology paper for CRAs prior to Christmas. I am informed that this did not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lengthy time delay has frustrated the desire of NSW to progress this matter so that mutually acceptable CRAs can be completed and RFAs drafted. To a large degree, these delays are attributable to the tardy performance of those Commonwealth agencies involved in the CRA process. This State remains committed to implementing the provisions of the National Forest Policy Statement, including the completion of CRAs and the preparation of RFAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, in recognition of the need for substantial progress on these issues, I propose that a Joint Commonwealth-NSW CRA/RFA Officials Implementation Committee be established, as a matter of urgency, to formulate a timetable and priorities for progress on these issues. NSW is keen to resolve the process, accreditation and methodology issues associated with CRAs and RFAs as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the context of RFAs, you will be aware that, in 1991, the then Prime Minister and Premier negotiated the draft South East Forests Agreement. The Agreement, which added substantial additional areas to the regional reserve system and prescribed levels of timber production, was signed by the Commonwealth and NSW Government in December 1993. There are significant implications for States arising from your policy statement on woodchip exports. In NSW, for example, the Government has a Long Term Wood Supply Agreement with Harris-Diashowa Australia Pty Ltd for the annual supply of a prescribed volume of pulpwood. This agreement runs until the year 2007.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Government has been working to give effect to the various requirements of the South East Forests Agreement. Therefore, I ask that you confirm that the South East Forests Agreement constitutes a RFA within the context of your statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of reserve criteria, I believe that there is a strong need to address the key strategic issues, particularly the impacts which such a reserve system may have on matters such as the timber industry. Accordingly, there is a need to establish a clear understanding of the impacts of such a reserve system for all jurisdictions, prior to the proposed criteria being finalised. Such an assessment will need to be undertaken before Governments commit themselves to specific criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the need to progress these matters, I would appreciate a prompt response to the approach which I have suggested and the issue regarding the South East Forests Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dr. Keating,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accreditation of the Land Conservation Council, and comprehensive assessment of the Central Highlands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a letter to you of 20 September 1992 Victoria requested that its Land Conservation Council (LCC) process for planning the use of public land be accredited by the Commonwealth under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the LCC was engaged in a study of Victoria's timber-rich Central Highlands. Accordingly Victoria also sought joint work and cooperation in order to maximise consistency between the LCC's recommendations on land use and the Australian Heritage Commission's listing of National Estate, and provide a common basis for resource use decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It transpires that the joint work which is now proceeding in the Central Highlands does not qualify as a "comprehensive assessment" under the National Forest Policy Statement signed late last year, since no formal request for such an assessment was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth and State officers discussed these matters at a meeting in Melbourne on 9 August. On accreditation, it was noted that this would mean simply that the work of the LCC was an adequate basis for the Commonwealth's decision-making. It was recognised that the LCC was more likely than almost any other arrangement in Australia to accommodate the Commonwealth's interests. Your officers suggested that the aim should probably be to accredit the LCC with some limitations specified, and that the general LCC process might be accredited first and then studies in particular areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was agreed that the Commonwealth would list its interests, including the information level it required, so that Victoria knew the criteria for accreditation; and that in order for the Commonwealth to find out more about the LCC there would be a presentation in Canberra, with the focus on the Central Highlands as a current example of the LCC's work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the Central Highlands it was decided that the Canberra meeting would be an opportunity to discuss whether in fact the current joint work was comprehensive or whether there were gaps.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the proposed meeting is not able to take place until 20 October, I am in the meantime writing to confirm the Victorian Government's interest in having the LCC process accredited.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dr Keating</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REGIONAL FORESTS AGREEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Associate Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Roger Beale, recently sent me a copy of the paper "Regional Forests Agreements&mdash;A Commonwealth Position".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After considering the paper I have concluded that at both Commonwealth and State levels we need to revisit the objectives of the National Forests Policy Statement. My recollection is that the concept of comprehensive regional assessment and regional agreements was based on the desire to reduce fragmentation and duplication in the land use decision making process, and to achieve agreed and durable land use decisions so that the community obtains a balanced return from all forest uses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these objectives in mind I was greatly concerned at the proposed process for arriving at an agreed position on forest management and use. It appears to be extremely complex, open-ended, and resource-intensive. In addition, the scope and nature of Commonwealth involvement are not well defined, particularly in relation to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) legislation. As you and I well know, an intergovernmental committee is an unwieldy mechanism, and would be unlikely to reach agreement on the interpretation of the assessments demanded by the process, let alone successfully negotiate the intergovernmental agreement along with the detailed forest management guidelines and plans. The process would never end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implicit in the proposal would seem to be a requirement that Victoria re-visit many of the processes and procedures that are either on-going including old-growth studies and forest management planning or which have been completed for the foreseeable future such as the identification of regional sustained yields or public land use decisions following assessment by the Land Conservation Council (LCC). This would be an example of the very duplication of effort which I understood we were trying to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that I wrote in September last year (copy attached) expressing concern that commitments by our two Governments to co-operate in natural resource use planning may be failing to produce worthwhile results. In particular I formally requested:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an identification of specific gaps, if any, in the joint work being carried out in Victoria's Central Highlands forests, in terms of its adequacy for the Commonwealth to come to a firm determination on use of those forests; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commonwealth's criteria for accreditation under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on the Environment along with a summary of where, if at all, Victoria's Land Conservation Council (LCC) process is considered to fall short.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am still waiting for a response on these two points. I am aware that at the recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development on 30 March a very preliminary paper on the Commonwealth's proposed approach to accreditation was discussed, however, I understand that there was little real progress on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view consideration of a process for achieving Regional Forest Agreements would be assisted if we could see what the implications were in practice. I suggest that to get a practical focus both the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments commit to an attempt to reach agreement on forest management and use in the Victorian Central Highlands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step Victoria and the Commonwealth should move to solve any outstanding issues with respect to accreditation of the LCC process so that the work done for the Melbourne Area 2 studies can be taken into account. In my assessment the LCC process meets the Commonwealth broad criteria as presented in their recent paper. Therefore the Commonwealth should, as I suggested in my earlier letter, specifically identify any deficiencies in the LCC processes so Victoria can consider how these might be overcome. Any extra work is needed in the region over and above that already done by the LCC and the Australian Heritage Commission should then be specified and completed so that negotiation of the Regional Agreement can proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the Forest Management Plans, I would like to suggest that detailed management plans be prepared by officials experienced in this work in the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources once the broad terms of the Regional Agreement are settled. Commonwealth officials would then be given the opportunity to make comment and negotiate amendments if the plans do not meet Commonwealth requirements. A time limit not in excess of six months should be set for negotiating this final agreement with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that unless an attempt is made to actually finalise an agreement, discussions will continue at the non-specific level and we will make no progress on an issue of fundamental importance to this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. The United States of America is the world's largest economy and has traditionally been and remains a critically important market for Australian exporters. In 1993-94 the United States represented our second largest export market, after Japan, with exports totalling $5 billion.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for the question. It is true that on Friday I announced a review of Australia's trading relationship with the United States for the purpose of examining what scope there is to lift our trade performance in the United States. There is an apparent deterioration of our trade performance in relation to the US, and it is important that we address it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McKiernan said, the US is and remains the world's single largest import market. Imports have been growing at the rate of about 7.3 per cent per annum over the past decade. It is a market offering immense opportunities for Australia, and there are some areas in which we are succeeding quite well. We do not want, in looking at the overall picture, to lose sight of the successes. Our services exports to the United States are growing. Other important areas, such as computer equipment sales, seem to be increasing quite strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the three years of 1991, 1992 and 1993, our exports to the US fell. That exacerbated the trade deficit that we have always had with the US to the point where, in 1993-94, our trade deficit was $9 billion&mdash;obviously, a very substantial proportion of the deficit for that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some critical questions that we need to address. What can we do to address this situation? What do we need to do to strengthen our trade performance there? We need to look at the pattern of investment as well as trade. Overwhelmingly, we need to look at what we can do better to improve our performance in the United States&mdash;that is No. 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also address the barriers to Australia's trade with the United States. The United States, like Australia, is mainly an open market, but there are some barriers that continue and they affect our exporters directly. We want to look at that in the context of that deficit. We also want to look at the international trade policies of the United States and the implications they have for our trading position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of their international trade activities are substantially to Australia's benefit and we need to realise that, as well as address those which are to our disadvantage&mdash;some of which have had publicity recently. We are going to try to do a balanced review, try not to blame others for things that are of our making, look at our own performance and address some of the broader structural questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of possible reasons for the decline in our share of the US market, and they are not necessarily all problems. It may be caused by the fact that we are running into capacity constraints because of the diversion of trade to the Asian market. Our exports overall might not be falling. It may be&mdash;</PARA>

From 1973 to 1983, our market share globally fell significantly; we fell from 12th to 22nd. From 1983 to 1993, we maintained that relative position. Our share of world exports and our relative position in world exports have been the same in the last decade. So we are doing well in some markets and badly in others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before getting into the detail of this question, let me make it clear what the purpose of this grant was. I was challenging the conservation organisations to provide substantiated evidence about their claims of the conservation values of forest areas. I did not want unsubstantiated advice that had been made available in previous years around the time of the licence renewal process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agreed to provide them with funding to ensure that the information they provided was of the highest possibly quality. The advice they provided was an input&mdash;and only one of a number of inputs&mdash;into the preparation of my portfolio's advice to Minister Beddall. The grants were made from a departmental program dedicated to the implementation of the NFPS. It was stressed to the conservation groups that, whoever the conservation councils engaged in their work on this exercise, they must have the appropriate skills and that close cooperation must be maintained with the department to ensure that the public moneys were fully accounted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated before, the conservation organisations were required to sign an agreement setting out the terms and conditions of the grant. The agreement, which was signed by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, Environment Victoria and the Conservation Council of Western Australia, required the conservation organisations to produce three reports&mdash;an informal progress report, a draft final report and a final report. Those conditions were met. The conservation groups were asked to give priority to identifying old-growth forest and wilderness areas likely to be of high conservation value and likely to require interim protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the methodology, in the course of undertaking the grant the people contracted by the conservation organisations met with officers of my portfolio on the three occasions I mentioned. The methodology was set in the first meeting, with reports by the conservation councils on old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforest, endangered species, biodiversity and cultural values. The methodologies focused on the definitions used in the NFPS and the methods state agencies had used at various times to map those values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second meeting continued the discussion on the methodologies and thresholds to be used in examining old-growth forests and wilderness and discussed the level of substantiation that my portfolio would require.

In that context, he made some remarks. I should say that it has always been the intention of the government&mdash;it has been typified by our performance in previous budgets&mdash;to frame the most appropriate budget. It has sometimes been the case that measures in the budget are resisted in this chamber. Ruminating out aloud, as he was on that program, the Minister for Finance threw up some ideas about how this might be best dealt with in the current climate. I might underline that this climate is exampled by the disgraceful behaviour of the opposition in saying prior to a budget coming down that if there are any changes to taxation in that budget it will prevent the government from governing and resist such a budget measure in this chamber. That is a disgraceful example of opportunism. As the Minister for Finance said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, it is an example of a party that does not know the meaning of the terms `stable' or `long-term' and a party that has had three leaders in eight months.

Does the minister agree that a properly implemented carbon levy could complement both a no regrets policy and an integrated legislative and policy framework on greenhouse emissions? Can the minister give us an assurance that there will be real and effective measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention is to give the stakeholders input to the range of policy measures which the government could consider implementing to enhance our response to the level of greenhouse gas emissions. The consultations in themselves are a significant indication of the government's intention to develop a serious response to the challenge of the level of greenhouse gas emissions, which is a very serious global environmental problem. The process follows Cabinet's reaffirmation in December of the need for an effective and ongoing response to climate change and a clear message from the national greenhouse inventory that with our current enhanced greenhouse measures Australia would not meet its targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically in response to the second part of Senator Margetts's question, as the government considers options and discuses them with interest groups, a properly implemented small greenhouse levy could be considered as part of a broad ranging integrated package of measures.

Is it a fact that Air New Zealand has no significant engineering facilities in Australia and that the airline has no experience in handling such advanced engines? Is it a fact that this decision will cost the jobs of 57 workers at the Hawker de Havilland plant in Melbourne, where the engines were built and where they have been serviced since 1983? Was this decision based on the relatively favourable currency exchange rate with no consideration being given to factors such as quality, experience or Australian jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the purposes of contracting work out, New Zealand and Australia are taken as one industry. That is as a result of the Anzac ship treaty, closer economic relations and closer defence relations. On many occasions Australian firms have benefited from that by winning contracts in New Zealand and doing the work in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAAF had to be absolutely certain in letting this contract that all companies that put in had the technical expertise to do so. It spent a lot of time establishing and checking that each of the bidders&mdash;there were more than two, as you probably know&mdash;had that expertise. Having established that fact, the question then came down to who would win the tender. The New Zealand firm won the tender, and won it overwhelmingly, and therefore was awarded the work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The just recently published white paper made the point that New Zealand and Australia as a market in defence areas would be considered as one. I did not hear anyone from the opposition objecting at that particular point to its being one market because the benefits go both ways. In this case, the New Zealand firm won fair and square and by a very substantial margin. On other occasions Australian firms will win work for New Zealand defence products and will employ people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whilst I regard it as a matter of regret that an Australian firm in this case was not competitive&mdash;it was competitive in the contract for helicopter engines that was awarded at about the same time&mdash;it was not a question of favouring any other firm. It was simply a question of letting the tender processes go. Each company entered that tender process knowing that the lowest price, if all other things were equal, would apply, and so it occurred.</PARA>

Further to the question of maintenance of RAAF aircraft and other defence force aircraft, is it a fact that 24 of the army's fleet of 38 Blackhawk helicopters are currently grounded because of cracks, corrosion and shortage of spare parts?

On that particular point, I have to say that Senator Woods is right to be critical, as I am critical, of the performance of the army on the availability of Blackhawk helicopters. But it is impossible, right across the whole spectrum of defence equipment, not to have problems at some stage. Those problems are now being addressed. It was found that the Blackhawk, operating in Australian conditions, have a much higher requirement for spare parts than Sikorsky ever contemplated. We are now in the process of getting into the spare parts pipeline and putting more money in to make sure we have adequate spares. It is a criticism. It is not one related to the first part of your question. I accept the criticism of the performance in this area. It is an area we need to improve in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for his question. He is from Victoria and it is well known that he has a great interest in these issues of employment and unemployment. He is also noted for his ability to point out the deficiencies in the Kennett Liberal government vis-a-vis employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, it is true that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has produced a monthly brochure on the quarterly labour market developments for around 60 Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force regions. Today, of course, some further figures came out which indicated further job growth in Australia. The ANZ job advertisement series released today indicated an increase of 0.5 per cent for January 1995, which the ANZ said pointed to sustained job growth in 1995. That is welcome news for job seekers in Australia, but possibly not so welcome by those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> article. What the article failed to note was that the trends evident in the figures indicate that the benefits of the economic and jobs recovery are broadly spread across almost all regions of Australia. In other parts of Victoria there were substantial employment gains made over the year to December 1994, with the north-eastern Melbourne, south-eastern Melbourne, the Barwon-western and all Gippsland regions experiencing employment gains in excess of 10,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also encouraging to note that almost all of the ABS labour force regions in Victoria recorded a reduction in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate fell in all 14 regions, with very sharp falls in Gippsland, down 7.4 per cent; Central Highlands-Wimmera, down 6.7 per cent; and Mornington Peninsula, down 5. 5 per cent. However, the government is aware that some regions of Australia, such as the western suburbs of Melbourne, continue to have high long-term unemployment levels&mdash;structural changes being one of the causes. As a result, we are addressing those issues affecting the western suburbs of Melbourne in the Working Nation statement of last year, which provides over a period of four years for nearly $10 billion worth of labour market reform programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that those programs, particularly the job compact specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed, are the best ways to deal with the long-term unemployment in the western region of Melbourne. To further show that, we would point out that we have already spent $3.7 million in the central Melbourne and north-western suburbs since 1991, and we will be spending a further $1.1 million in these regions to help the labour programs in this area of long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article, I want to point out, does state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The west's losses reflect the lopsided pattern of job losses in Victoria, which have been exacerbated by the Kennett Government's crusade to wipe out 20 per cent of jobs in the Victorian public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no information directly from the survey that can identify job losses per region in Victoria as a result of the Kennett government's policies. However, it is well known that the Kennett government, since it has been in office, has got rid of 50,000 public sector jobs, 207 schools have closed and 11,000 teachers have had their jobs retrenched. That is an indication of Mr Kennett's concern for the long-term unemployed and job prospects in Victoria.

<PARA>In moving to take note, I would draw the Senate's attention to the damage that the lack of procedure, lack of rules, lack of decency and lack of proper management has caused to the timber industry in Western Australia, particularly to the company Whittakers. In doing so, I would note also one particular aspect of an answer given by Senator Collins; that is, he made the observation that 1.5 million cubic metres of hardwood timber are produced in Australia at the present moment. What he did not say is that there are 100,000 cubic metres of hardwood timber imported primarily out of the South-East Asia rainforest. Of course, if the extremists in this argument continue to get their way and proceed down their line, it will mean that the whole of that amount will be imported into this country out of the South-East Asian rainforest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular point I would make here relates to the company Whittakers, the lack of procedure and how this has been done on the back, I might add, of the Australian Heritage Commission-CALM agreement. That is, there was a regional assessment done in 1992, there was an agreement signed and, on the basis of that, Whittakers invested some $25 million in a variety of activities in the timber industry. Of the 66 particular coupes identified in Western Australia, we find that there are 12 wherein with the process that was adopted, in fact, there was the situation where 60 per cent of their supply of karri and 40 per cent of their supply of jarrah were included. Not having access to that particular timber in itself makes that particular company unviable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator Faulkner is now leaving. Senator Faulkner, this is what your processes did to this particular company. Your processes have been put in place to ensure that this company would go broke; they would lead to an immediate loss of 250 jobs. But, more importantly, Senator Faulkner made mention in his answer&mdash;I think to the supplementary question&mdash;to downstream processing. Let us have a look, in relation to that $25 million, at what has occurred in downstream processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whittakers put $8 million into developing an activated carbon project to use the sawdust generated from its mills. For those who do not know what `activated carbon' is, it is a product used for filtering water and filtering air&mdash;taking the nasties out of them. As Senator Collins, who is now leaving the chamber, would agree, it is a very important adjunct to the timber industry. It is one which allows the industry to be profitable while it continues to properly manage the forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, while taking note of downstream processing, the other project being put at risk is downstream development. That has put at risk all hardwood plantations which have been developed by Whittakers in the Albany region in Western Australia. Once again, what is being affected are investments which have been made since 1992 on the back of the AHC-CALM agreement. In terms of value adding and value development, an enormous amount of damage is being done to Australia's chances of ever becoming a competitive nation by having a government which is bereft of policy and just wants to grab political opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other points which I want to raise are, in my view, equally important in the downstream processing; that is, the development of softwood timbers in the Whittakers plantations in the Greenbushes area, the activity that is going on there and the development of a productive industry in Australia. It is interesting to note that some of that work&mdash;the development of veneer board, chipboard and a whole range of other things&mdash;is done in the Swan electorate in Western Australia by the factories of Whittakers and also Bunnings Wesfarmers. What this decision, the lack of process and the unjustness have done is put all these projects severely at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to the Chairman of Whittakers, Mr Bob Bunning, on Friday. He said that Whittakers is in a precarious situation at this time, and he asked me to bring it to the attention of this chamber and the government. If its log supply runs out within two weeks, and it has not been guaranteed a supply, it is most likely that all of these projects&mdash;the activated carbon project, the hardwood plantations at Albany, the pinewood plantation developments, plus the flow-on from those things&mdash;will collapse. As far as I am concerned, I believe that the best that we can say about Senator Faulkner in this debate is that he is no more than an economic and environmental vandal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell raised a question when he waved a few letters around and said, `Here are the letters from Premier Fahey and others that have invited the Commonwealth to identify its criteria.' I would like to read briefly from the national forest policy statement. It goes to the question of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. That is another important factor in all of this, because the national forest policy statement deals with not only industry security and long-term industry viability but also care for the environment. I hope you lot on the other side are not advocating, because it appears you are, the total destruction of this country's forests. I will read to you from the national forest policy statement. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment provides for the identification of the interests of both the Commonwealth and State Governments in land use decision making and the accommodation of those interests where there are joint responsibilities.

<PARA>In response to a question from Senator Margetts, Senator Faulkner indicated that the government was committed to trying to reduce greenhouse emissions. As usual, the response is in the form of a levy or a tax. We went through this with superannuation. The first reform to superannuation meant getting an extra billion dollars out of people's superannuation savings. The second consideration was the prudential controls. The government is using the same tack in relation to greenhouse emissions. It wants to tax first, get extra revenue for the government and then look at scientific measures to reduce greenhouse emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I also want to make today is that this is akin to a GST, but it has worse features than a GST because it falls very heavily on the productive costs of Australian industries. In addition, not only does it feed on to those costs; but also it feeds on to the costs of ordinary consumers. The sorts of people who are going to be hardest hit are those on fixed incomes and pensioners. For example, if you tax coal&mdash;coal is an essential ingredient in firing the furnaces for the generation of electricity&mdash;then those electricity costs will feed into ordinary consumers. Where is the offset to the industry which applies in the case of a GST? It is certainly of no benefit to consumers. People on fixed incomes, particularly pensioners, will be adversely affected by a carbon tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give one example to illustrate the very extensive damage that a carbon tax will do to Australian industry. In recent years the cement industry has undergone tremendous restructuring. We have now four or five very large and viable producers of cement in Australia. However Australian production is always under threat from imports. You may recall that during that restructuring there was talk of clinker coming in and competing adversely with Australian production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the environment minister, who is not here, that the problem with a carbon tax is that it will add significantly to the cost of producing cement here in Australia. It will add to the costs of the Australian cement producers, but at the same time the costs of the overseas suppliers will not be increased one iota. We have an additional imposition on Australian manufacturing which is taking jobs away from Australian people, reducing the efficiency of Australian manufacturing and making it competitively advantageous to bring that cement in from overseas. What sort of government do we have here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just heard an eloquent response from Senator Murphy about protecting the jobs of Australian workers. He had the temerity to suggest that the opposition has no idea about protecting jobs of blue collar workers or protecting Australian industry. I put it to Senator Murphy and the government that this carbon tax will have a detrimental effect on jobs. We are warning you: the main issue at present appears to be how high that carbon tax should be, but the argument should be about putting into effect appropriate controls to ensure minimum emission. That is what the emphasis should be on&mdash;not raising revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue seems to be about raising additional taxes and using protecting the environment as an excuse for doing that. But I say that you should turn around your priorities. Don't do what you did in superannuation&mdash;raise the $1 billion or so first and then look at the prudential controls. Look at the real environmental issues that will make some contribution to reducing greenhouse emissions. Don't just add taxes for the sake of it. If you do, you will reduce employment, reduce Australian competitiveness and add to the cost of consumers when they cannot afford to pay it. </PARA>

Firstly, the major question that we have to consider in relation to using economic instruments in any way is: if the real cost of much of the environmental damage that takes place as a result of economic activity is not included by way of taxes or levies, who does pay? How equitable is that? Is it the workers who pay? What about the people who are going to suffer from the negative impacts of climate change?</PARA></TALK.START>

Unfortunately, it is not. It is happening here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had frequent debate about the impacts of drought. We know that we can expect more of these occurrences due to climate change as time goes by. It is not, as the National Farmers Federation suggests, something that will happen in a nice regulated way that will mean that some areas will get more rain and some areas will get less. We know the evidence is that it is associated with damaging weather patterns and disrupted weather patterns. There are economic and social costs as well as environmental costs. I want to know who the heck the opposition thinks is going to pay and when that payment should take place. We are talking perhaps about billions of dollars worth of damage that may take place even in our primary sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What kind of damage to human lives are we seeing take place now in Europe? Who should pay? Should the future pay? Should the kids pay? Should the environment pay? Should the species pay? When there are slightly increased temperatures in water currents, various species do not turn up at all. This is already happening. We should be able to model the effects of increasing numbers of El Nino events and when these will be likely to happen as a result of climate change. In such cases, entire fish species do not turn up or breed, entire bird species do not breed for three years in a row and animal species that are part of this change do not survive or, when they do&mdash;and others do not&mdash;they take over to create an imbalance in the system. Who pays for that? Who does the opposition suggest should pay for that? Often the farmers end up paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was really interested when Senator Watson suggested that what he thought appropriate&mdash;I wrote this down&mdash;is putting in appropriate controls. I agree that not one thing will do it. We talked frequently about no-regrets policies. I have talked about them on a number of occasions because not even a no-regrets policy is being implemented in Australia. They would mean that we would have no regrets and the ability to both benefit the economy and improve greenhouse performance. We have not been doing even that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember clearly one day giving details of how this might be implemented. Members of the opposition were standing up and asking, `Yes, but who will pay the bill?'. I said, `I don't believe this.' One can present information that is clearly available through studies that have been done. It is convenient to close one's ears and believe that it is not happening. So there is a no-regrets policy that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the possibility that the real cost of economic decisions should be shared around, because in the end the future, the kids and the environment will end up paying. I agree that putting in appropriate controls is also important. But I cannot remember one time recently when the opposition has even agreed to having appropriate controls put on industry to make sure that it improves its environmental performance. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example, which occurred in discussions about lead in petrol, involved improving or even keeping to the standards that this government said it could achieve. In the end, both major parties voted against that amendment, which said, `We will keep to these standards that we have promised to keep to.' In the end, when the buck stops here, what will the opposition agree to that would improve environmental performance? So far I have not seen anything. I guess that it has to show its credentials a bit better before it gets any support from us on this issue. </PARA>

However, increasing the costs of carbon based fuels because they are causing environmental damage is sound, but that money should be channelled back into alternative technologies, in which there will be a great deal more employment and economic activity. At the same time, it is in that area where the money is spent that the main reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson used a rather silly argument in relation to the GST. Senator Watson is entirely wrong in that argument. The opposition wanted to increase tax on goods and services at the point of consumption. If that is not increasing the costs of goods and services to consumers, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correct way of imposing such a tax&mdash;and this is one of the points the Democrats were making all along&mdash;is to put the tax on the resource inputs to production, such as coal and oil, so that those costs would be carried through as a moiety in the final cost of goods and services. You do not tax the labour component, nor do you tax the value added component of good and services. I am surprised that Senator Watson is so wrong in that respect. We do not want to tax value adding and we do not want to tax the labour component at a time when we have 800,000 unemployed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go much further than the government's targets in relation to greenhouse. I have in front of me a document from the Institute of Engineers, no less, in which they draw attention to a 1993 report of the Victorian government which says that they could achieve not only a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Part of the way of doing that, they identify, is by taking that tax on carbon base fuels and channelling it back into things like house insulation, better house design, solar hot water services, better transport and more public transport&mdash;a whole range of things&mdash;all of which would stimulate Australian industry, all of which would provide employment and none of which would have any of the adverse consequences to which Senator Watson referred to a moment ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The present state and federal governments have a plan to build a national electricity grid. Nowhere in that plan have we seen a proposal that electricity should be made a great deal more efficient in its use. Picking up the last point that Senator Watson made, he assumes that a given amount of electricity has to be used for a particular purpose. That is absolute nonsense. There are enormous opportunities for saving electricity. One of the ways to bring about those improvements in efficiency is to impose on the electricity utilities a requirement that they supply end-use energy services and not electricity. If you make that simple change you will see an enormous improvement in the efficiency with which electricity is used. You will see a reduction in the amount of electricity used and, despite an increase in the unit cost, you would see a reduction in the overall absolute costs of energy. </PARA>

I am particularly concerned that this is an area of Australia which now has the highest levels of unemployment. In recent years this area has had very high levels of unemployment and has also seen a dramatic improvement during that time&mdash;a drop from about 22 per cent to 15 per cent. That figure is in itself highly significant but is still, in my view, not nearly good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned that public attention be drawn in this parliament to the occasions where actions are being taken by various levels of government which undermine the levels of economic prosperity of groups of Australians and within the Commonwealth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fundamental constitutional proposition that there be no discrimination against people from one particular region over another. However, we see in the state of Victoria quite clear evidence of discrimination. The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), in his answer to a question asked today, indicated that he had no information on the disproportionate effect of unemployment in Melbourne particularly as a result of the Kennett government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put to the Senate some information which perhaps draws to public attention the real impact of policy changes that have occurred in Victoria and particularly look at the area of education. Discriminatory policies are being undertaken which have a direct bearing on traditional Labor areas such as the north and the west of Melbourne. Policies of revenge, policies of vengeance, are being expressed against people who tend to vote for the Labor Party through and through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, for instance, to the issue of school closures. These have a bearing on people being prepared to go into the work force and for life in terms of being able to deal with the great difficulties that confront citizens of this country from time to time. In the first round of school closures in Victoria in December 1992, the rate of closures for secondary schools in Labor-held seats was four times that in Liberal-held seats. Twelve of the 22 schools closed were in the north and west of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the issue of the abolition of special needs for people in this region, we see once again issues in terms of immigration, in terms of English as a second language and in terms of social disadvantage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you see in education is a clear case where up to 1,700 students have dropped out of the system as a result of these closures in schools. We have seen staffing levels cut dramatically in these regions. The school at which I personally used to work, the Box Forest Secondary College in Broadmeadows, has been allocated 100 teachers less under the Kennett government. This has a direct bearing on the capacity of students of this region to cope with very basic issues relating to preparation for work and for life.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 1 December 1994 concerning the Health Insurance (1994-1995 General Medical Services Table) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1994 No 362.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I appreciate the concerns raised about orthodontists and dentists, I must point out that a move to disallow the General Medical Services Table would have severe consequences for all patients seeking medical services (including prescribed (dental) medical services):</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">under Sub-section 4(6) of the Health Insurance Act a regulation lapses after 12 months and 15 sitting days (of the House of Representatives) from date of Gazettal</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if a new regulation is not in force Medicare benefits are not payable</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where a regulation is disallowed the previous table could be reactivated but only if the 12 months and 15 sitting days have not passed</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reactivating the old table would of course still create difficulties as old fee and rebate levels would apply</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the previous regulation came into force and was Gazetted on 1 November 1993. If not repealed this regulation would automatically cease as from close of business on the second sitting day in 1995 of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must therefore ask that the Committee reconsider its decision to seek to disallow the Health Insurance (1994-1995 General Medical Services Table) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Medical Benefits (Dental Practitioners) Advisory Committee (established under Section 136 of the National Health Act) considers applications for the accreditation of orthodontists under rule 21 of the Health Insurance (1994-1995 General Medical Services Table) Regulations and makes recommendations to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering applications, the Committee has regard to the fact that a dental practitioner must be a State registered orthodontist or a practitioner not having specialist registration but can demonstrate to the Committee that they have qualifications or experience as well as competence in the field of orthodontics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee in its deliberations, considers the qualifications and experience of practitioners together with any statements advising the State Dental Board that they have restricted their practice to the referred practice of orthodontics or any evidence that they are a State registered specialist in orthodontics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any practitioner who is not accredited by the Advisory Committee may appeal that decision to the Medical Benefits (Dental Practitioners) Appeal Committee. There have been no appeals to the Appeal Committee in the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been 15 dental practitioners accredited by the Committee during 1994. No practitioners who applied for accreditation were declined during 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rule-maker stated in the body of the instrument that he was making it as delegate of the Civil Aviation Authority. The rule-maker signed the instrument, however, for and on behalf of the Civil Aviation Authority. These designations do not appear to be consistent. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on who was the rule-maker in this case and whether the inconsistency has any implications for validity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument does not indicate the day on which it was made, although the explanatory statement advises that the Authority issued an exemption number BKFO/59/94 to Impulse Airlines Pty Limited on 8 September 1994. The instrument is also expressed to be effective from 8 September 1994.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument in question was a disallowable instrument as a result of the operation of regulation 5A of the Regulations. You will recall that regulation 5A was recently inserted into the Regulations in accordance with my undertaking to your Committee to amend the Regulations to ensure that documents which affect the operation of Civil Aviation Orders are subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that Regulation 5A, which came into operation in June 1994, in fact reversed a practice which had been in operation for several decades and imposed new formal requirements on instruments of the kind in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation Authority advises me that, in this instance the instrument was issued only a few months after the new requirement came into operation and the District Office issuing the instrument had overlooked the need to have it cleared by the Authority's legal drafters in order to ensure that it complied with the new statutory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you correctly pointed out, the instrument was defective because it did not comply with these requirements. I share your Committee's concerns that legislative instruments of this kind which are subject to Parliamentary scrutiny should be prepared so that they comply strictly with the requirements of the enabling legislation and are also in accordance with the principles enunciated by your Committee in its regular reports to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have made it clear to the Authority that it must ensure that any legislative instruments that are subject to Parliamentary scrutiny must be vetted by the Authority's legislative drafters in order to prevent occurrences of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to this particular instrument it should be noted that, if it had been validly made, then it would have ceased to have effect on 31 October 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I explained in my letter to you of 10 January 1995, Instrument No 45 of 1994 seeks to correct an error in Instrument No 24 of 1994.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Donald of the Repatriation Medical Authority gave an assurance that deletion of the phrase "of the pancreas" would not disadvantage someone retrospectively, purely because it is medically impossible for someone to suffer from, or die as a result of, gastro-oesophageal reflux of the pancreas. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease does not originate in, or affect, the pancreas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of including the words "of the pancreas" is to require that death be caused by gastro-oesophageal disease of the pancreas which, as I have pointed out, is a medical impossibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave notice last Thursday that, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I would withdraw notices of motion of disallowance today in respect of two instruments of delegated legislation, namely, Instrument No. 45 of 1994 made under subsection 196B(3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and an exemption under Regulation 207 of the Civil Aviation Regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of these instruments were subject to a motion of disallowance of which I gave notice on 15 November 1994. The committee terms such notices as `protective'. They are protective in the sense that the notice allows time for the committee and the issuing authority to resolve matters about which the committee has concern regarding a particular instrument or group of instruments. Once the protective notice is given, 15 sitting days of the Senate can elapse before an instrument is deemed to have been disallowed due to the passage of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unusual for the committee to give notice of disallowance where it is not satisfied with some aspect of an instrument and it is clear that the matter cannot be resolved within 15 sitting days of the tabling of that instrument. After that period of 15 sitting days has elapsed and no disallowance has taken place, it is not possible to take any action in relation to a delegated instrument. A protective notice of disallowance therefore must be given within the initial 15 sitting day period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has usually corresponded with the relevant minister before placing an instrument under a protective notice of disallowance. Informal discussions often take place after the initial correspondence is forwarded to the minister. Those discussions, when necessary, can lead to a resolution of matters of concern to the committee. The committee believes that this is the most appropriate way for it to discharge its responsibility to the Senate. It is preferable for the committee to resolve problems with delegated legislation, if that is possible, rather than concern the Senate with actual motions of disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the committee operates in the way which I have outlined, it has not considered it necessary to recommend disallowance of a delegated instrument to the Senate since 1988. On the other hand, the committee will not hesitate to recommend disallowance to the Senate if it deems that course of action to be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the committee to operate as it does, it requires the cooperation of the agencies responsible for delegated legislation. The committee should not be placed in the position of giving notice of intention to withdraw a notice of disallowance, pending the receipt of a satisfactory response before the next sitting day. This is what occurred in relation to the two instruments to which I have already referred, namely, Instrument No. 45 of 1994 made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and an exemption under Regulation 207 of the Civil Aviation Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday morning, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances had not received satisfactory responses in relation to either of these instruments. The last day for resolving the motions of disallowance, however, was today. It was for this reason, on behalf of the committee, that I gave notice of my intention to withdraw each notice of disallowance. I made it clear on Thursday, however, that if satisfactory replies had not been received by today, I would not proceed with the withdrawal. The instruments would thus be deemed to be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the former instrument, a response had been received by the committee, but the committee required further clarification. That information was not available by Thursday morning last. If the agency concerned had been more prompt in its initial response, the situation may not have been reached where the delegated legislation risked the possibility of lapsing because of effluxion of time. In this regard, my original correspondence to the minister was forwarded on 10 November 1994, but the minister's initial reply to that correspondence was dated some two months later on 10 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the latter instrument, on behalf of the committee, I wrote to the minister on 18 October last outlining the committee's concerns. Not until Thursday of last week did the committee receive any written response, despite reminders from staff of the regulations and ordinances committee and finally by me direct to the minister's office. The blame does not lie directly with the minister, but the committee would expect he would inform his officers that correspondence from the committee should be answered promptly. For officers to do otherwise is treating the committee and the Senate with disdain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both responses were received by Thursday afternoon and I withdrew the protective notices some few minutes earlier today. It appears that the latter instrument is invalid, but as the time for its operation has now expired, nothing would have been gained by proceeding to disallowance. It may be necessary, however, for the committee to allude to this instrument further in its annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind agencies that although the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is a multi-party committee, politics do not intrude in its examination of delegated legislation. Its examination is confined to the principles as outlined in the Senate's standing order 23(3). That part of Standing Orders reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee shall scrutinise each instrument to ensure:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the busniess of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 1326 standing in the name of Senator Ian Macdonald for this day, relating to an order for the production of documents by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) concerning the assessment of forest areas for their conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is obviously running for cover and taking every opportunity to obstruct the Senate looking properly at the documents, the advice and the assessments that have been given. I will use part of my very limited five minutes to answer Senator Coulter's question. The answer is this: I do not think the amendment that Senator Coulter wants to add to my motion, strictly speaking, fits in with it, but I have no  objection to it being added if we are able to get it through. His amendment is along the lines of making this government accountable&mdash;making it account for its actions. Whilst, technically, I do not think it is correct, I am quite happy to add it on if the Senate is disposed to including it in my motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion simply asks the government&mdash;and the government has given no indication as to why it opposes this&mdash;to provide us with those assessments that have been done. I might answer Senator Sherry's objection in advance; he will no doubt say that it will take up a lot of resources. The resources would simply involve photocopying the assessments that the government has already received. If Senator Faulkner's office is not staffed to do that&mdash;even with the hundreds and hundreds of people employed&mdash;I will volunteer my office to photocopy those assessments so that they can be made available to the Senate. I do not want to hear any rubbish about not having resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think this is urgent and needs to be dealt with today because, all of last week, we heard from the government about these 1,300, 509 or 511 coupes which have been assessed by the conservation councils at a cost of over $100,000 to the taxpayer. They were talked about all week. This Senate should be entitled to have a look at those assessments. There cannot be any secret in them. They were done by conservation councils&mdash;so-called public bodies. To do those assessments, they received many thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money. For that expense, we should at least be able to see what they have come up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why the government is opposed to having us look at them. It has transpired in the last week that, of those assessments apparently conducted by the conservation societies, we have found five coupes that they assessed that do not even exist. We have found other coupes where there is not a single tree; instead, there are roads running through them and airfields on them. So I can understand why the government will do everything possible to keep us from looking at those assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the whole conservation value process has been put in jeopardy, belittled and made to look foolish because of the way the government has gone about it. The money that has been spent and the legality and regularity of this process have been called into question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Sherry to explain to us what he and Senator Faulkner have got to hide about these assessments. Why won't they let us look at them? It is pretty obvious that they have been done in a very shoddy way and that people have received money for doing them. Natalie and others&mdash;we still do not know who Natalie is&mdash;have received money for doing them. I think the Senate and the public of Australia should be entitled to see the work that Natalie and others did for the very large amounts of money that they were paid, and I would like Senator Sherry to explain to us why that is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Senate to the last line of my motion, which asks that acquittal reports also be disclosed. Under the contract signed between Senator Faulkner and these various conservation groups, they had to put in acquittal reports showing how the more than $100,000 of taxpayers' money which was given to these conservation groups was used. They have to acquit properly and in an audited fashion how they have spent the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can be wrong with the Senate and the public of Australia being aware of how those moneys were spent, who got the moneys and whether we have got value for our money?

<PARA>I will speak to this motion only briefly because I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time. I think it is important that the government be required to account for the assessments that it has received from these so-called public bodies, the conservation groups. We received last thing last Thursday four contracts between the government and the various conservation agencies which indicated that over $100,000 had been paid to them for assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see just what we get for our money. We would like to see the manner in which the conservation groups did in fact do their assessments and what precision, learning and expertise was put into those assessments. Importantly, we also want to see who received those moneys that were paid. The contracts provide for acquittals to be tabled. Senator Faulkner mentioned, when he tabled the documents on Thursday, that he had received the appropriate and proper acquittal notices. The Senate should be entitled to look at those acquittals to see who got those moneys. Perhaps in that way Natalie and others might be identified and we might be able to see who got what money and for what quality of report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter intends to move an amendment to this motion which we are quite happy with. Whilst I do not think it is technically correct, I am happy for it to become part of the motion because it simply asks the government to table information that I think should be available to the public and certainly to the Senate. I understand that Senator Alston will then be moving an additional amendment which directly relates to the motion and simply calls for information that he has sought, both in question time and elsewhere, naming the consultants that were used and indicating who received what money and other information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again say to Senator Faulkner that he should not give us the argument about not having, amongst his hundreds of employees, sufficient resources to make this information available to the Senate. If that is the problem, for security reasons he should simply give the documents to me and, under the supervision of a member of his staff, I will do the photocopying. We only need to photocopy those assessments that the government has already received. They are there. It will not involve the government, the department or Senator Faulkner in any additional costs. If he sends a staff member around to my office with all of those assessments, I will photocopy them for him. He need not bother giving that as an excuse for why he is not prepared to do it. </PARA>

It is very important that we do not get trapped into allowing a return date some time late Thursday when, as those of us who have been around for a while know, you simply do not have any opportunity to debate the matter until the Senate resumes a fortnight later. That would be most unfortunate. Quite clearly, it would very much suit the government's agenda. Senator Faulkner will be desperately hoping that this matter will have died by then.

I have moved my amendment on the basis that it will give the government every opportunity and more to provide the information that we require when it ought to be required; that is, right now, while the Senate is sitting and during this debate. The last thing we want to do is provide an opportunity for Senator Faulkner to simply procrastinate to the point where the matter runs into the sand.

It seems that Senator Alston saw here an opportunity to run quickly into the chamber and add a motion.

I point out to Senator Coulter, Senator Kernot and anyone else who might be interested that the requests of Senator Alston in (a) and (b) were simply made by him in questions without notice last week. Senator Faulkner has been particularly aware of (b). It was mentioned in every debate last week.

If they do not, the additional amount of work required by Senator Faulkner's department to get that information would be quite minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information sought by Senator Alston in paragraph (a) is the sort of information&mdash;documents and methodology&mdash;that we were seeking in questions without notice all last week. Today Senator Alston again asked Senator Faulkner to spell out the methodology and criteria. In the chamber today, in answering those questions without notice, Senator Faulkner simply said that it was all in the documents. It is not. We got those documents at 6.30 p.m. last Thursday. They were supposed to be tabled by 5 p.m., but we allowed it to go on. It put our whole process back a little. We went through this on Thursday night. Senator Faulkner was very generous to give us some information or concede the notice of motion at 7.30 p.m., but it was only because we got what we did at 6.30 p.m. and it took a little while to do it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston has been asking for this information. It is not information that should be terribly difficult to get. Surely Senator Faulkner's department must have somewhere the methodology and criteria required to be used by the conservation groups. It must have written to someone and told them what it was. If the only thing it has done is given them the contract, all Senator Faulkner needs do to answer paragraph (a) is to say, `It's in clause 4(b)', or whatever it is. It would not take him more than 20 seconds to do that. If it is not there and it is in a letter that has been sent to these people setting out the methodology and criteria, that would involve a junior clerk in a couple of minutes withdrawing the letter, photocopying it and sending it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the information in (a) and (b) is readily available to the minister. He or his department would not need any resource whatsoever to do it. Perhaps the information Senator Alston requests in paragraph (c) is a little more difficult to get, but that is something Senator Alston will no doubt address and is no doubt addressing with various people around the chamber. But certainly (a) and (b) are very easy to get. So I think the Democrats could well support at least (a) and (b) without having any hesitation that we might be putting the government to an unnecessary or a difficult task in getting that information. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pleasure for me to recall this excellent delegation that went from the Parliament of Australia to the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation. It was also our privilege to represent the parliament in a bilateral visit to Singapore and another to Indonesia. During the course of the AIPO conference, the 15th AIPO conference, in Manila we took the spare time we had to make a number of strategic visits within the Philippines. This report, which is tabled both in the House of Representatives and here today, summarises the delegation's meetings in those three neighbouring countries of Australia and our participation as an observer group in the organisation of the ASEAN parliaments which meets each year in one of the five capitals in South East Asia. It has been my honour to represent the parliament at four of these AIPO conferences: way back in 1979 in Bangkok, the next year in Jakarta, about five years ago in Manila, and again this last year in Manila. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have appropriate reflections upon the nature of such a delegation and the value to Australia in having more involvement with the parliaments of these five neighbouring countries. As a long serving senator with an interest in our neighbouring countries, I support the delegation's report in every particular, not least in urging our Presiding Officers and, indeed, all of us as colleagues together in the Senate and House of Representatives, to continue to go as an observer group to AIPO and to take the chance of such a visit to also conduct bilateral visits to two of the South-East Asian nations at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to our 21 recommendations, which are conveniently set out at the very beginning of the report. I should also add&mdash;maybe I am a little self-serving as one of those who helped put together this report&mdash;that in my view not only was this an excellent visit by three members of the House of Representatives, our admirable secretary, Mr Cleaver Elliott, who is in the chamber and did a first class job, and me but also this report is precise, it is focused as to action and it is imminently readable, of course, pending some critical material at the end of the report of interest to anyone who is picking up the whole report. There is an admirable set of photographs that pick up the flavour of what was a very happy and professional delegation from this parliament to the conference and these three nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the recommendations, I note with regard to our visit to Singapore that we have never had more open, constructive and closer relations between Australia and Singapore. At the time of our visit to Singapore the Prime Minister, Mr Goh, was visiting this country and was brilliantly received here, as we were in Singapore by not only the parliament, led by the speaker, who was technically our host, but also numerous ministers and officials in the areas where we sought to learn from the Singapore experience. We had talks with the minister for defence, for example, and his officials and note new initiatives that are being taken for the training of the Singapore defence force in various ways in Australia and involvement of our two nations together in a number of joint exercises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe strongly, and did for many years leading up to this particular visit, that Australia and Singapore are well placed to be close allies in this region&mdash;stable, sensible, professional, I think highly competent in technical particulars&mdash;and this strong relationship is of a kind that will further generate similar relationships with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Brunei, all six of the ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a statement that is so often made that Australia has a special relationship with these six ASEAN countries, and we would underline that. It is obviously important not only in foreign policy, defence and security terms but also in trade and, frankly, in cultural and people exchanges that we will have increasing involvement with each other in this important part of the Asia Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that our second recommendation refers to the airport in Singapore and to Singapore's greatly extended harbour, both of which are almost unrivalled in the world for efficiency and which serve our region to great advantage. I know that Hong Kong has a very busy airport&mdash;there are one or two airports in North America and Europe that rival the volume of traffic through an airport&mdash;but the Changi airport in Singapore is a model to the entire world for the way in which to conduct air traffic systems. There is a plan for a third runway, which I do not think will have the unfortunate political fallout that the present Labor government is copping from the third runway in Sydney. I draw senators' attention to the references that we have made to the talks we had about the airport and the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that we were greatly moved intellectually, especially emotionally, as we went to Changi to see the memorial of those Australians and others who were most unfortunately imprisoned at that place during the Second World War. In particular, we saw the museum erected there which, in all the detail of many photographs and exhibits, enables any visitor to capture a full impression of the horror of being a prisoner of war in Changi in the 1940s&mdash;50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also saw there a replica of the chapel that was erected by Australians in the Changi prisoner of war camp and was the place of worship for so many Christians and others during that difficult time. The actual original of the chapel is here in Canberra, and in our report we have called that at the 50th anniversary of these events consideration be given to how Australia could add resources for the further enhancement of the objectives of that museum and the memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Singapore has, in my estimation, become one of the most prosperous and technologically advanced cities in any part of the world. The Singapore people have added now an increasing sense of humour and an increasing relaxedness to be concerned about not only economic prosperity and technical achievement but also quality of life issues, and they are much more ready to understand neighbours such as Australia. I believe Australia and Singapore have a natural alliance to work together on all fronts in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the AIPO conference, there is a recommendation that relates to the East Asia growth area that the ASEAN nations have declared that includes the southern Philippines and the northern part of Indonesia and Brunei. This triangle, or economic growth area, attracts investment and other resources so that there is a three-country sharing of an area of development to the advantage of each nation. It is our observation that Australia ought to be a fourth part of that triangle, especially from the Northern Territory and South Australia, directly taking up opportunities for investment and trade in not only the field of cattle, live cattle and abattoirs, in, say, Davao city and Mindanao generally in the Philippines but also other opportunities that exist for us there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory minister responsible for liaison with these neighbouring countries&mdash;he visited the parliament last week&mdash;is to be commended for the high credibility that he and the Northern Territory government have gained in these areas. We want to see all of Australia, not just the Northern Territory, taking up opportunities, not least in this growth area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, in recommendations 13 and 15 we again refer to Mindanao. With some degree of regret I note that, whilst I have visited the Philippines on a number of occasions, I have not yet visited Mindanao. I do not believe many members of parliament have. It is the largest island closest to Australia. It ought to be included in any future bilateral visit by this parliament to the Philippines. This area is receiving thousands of head of Australian cattle. It is also able to receive a wide range of imports that will, to advantage, be developed in the largely grasslands area and tropical climate of Mindanao. A matter of political structure is being resolved between representatives of some minorities in Mindanao, especially the Islamic peoples and the government in Manila. But, as this is all the more resolved in the coming months and years, I believe there will be a stable part of the southern Philippines that should gain greater Australian attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We draw attention to including a visit to Mindanao in any future visit. In recommendation 15 we also encourage a trade fair of Australia's exports relevant to all the Philippines and for that to visit Mindanao. In particular, there is a need for abattoir techniques to be extended with advantage because of the quality of meat that would then come from the abattoirs after the import of Australian cattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One member of parliament put to me, and I note this just anecdotally, that we give a large amount of aid each year to the Philippines. Australia gives about $50 million worth of development assistance to the Philippines. This particular member of parliament, a very influential man, said we just assume that it is all doing good things but on many fronts. He put to us the rather too extreme view, I believe, that all of this could be closed down and that we should put all of that $50 million into improving the cattle industry of the Philippines. He said Australia would make a huge mark that the whole nation would understand immediately as the great gift of Australia to the upgrading of the cattle industry in the Philippines. I do not endorse the simplicity of that replacement approach, but I mention it because I think greater publicity needs to be given in the Philippines to Australia's development assistance projects. Certainly, greater effort should be made in the area of cattle and abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to the AIPO conference itself. Recommendations 6, 7 and 8 refer to that. I note that AIPO is the institution in our neighbouring countries which exists to promote democracy. Accordingly, it ought to continue to have the full attention of Australia as we wish to see democracy flourishing in countries which, from time to time, have had dictatorial periods and have had coups&mdash;have had quite undemocratic periods. The conference was marvellously conducted. It was worth the observation of each speech and debated resolution that was open to observer delegations such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we were in the Philippines, we went to Subic Bay to see the new investment area. Incentives are given by the Philippines government for business that would then export from Subic's magnificent harbour to the region. That certainly should be understood by Australians interested in investing in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also visited the site of the lahar volcanic flow, which we read about in our headlines when Mount Pinatubo erupted some months ago. The word `lahar' is an Indonesian word similar to our word `lava'. It is a kind of volcanic eruption where a mineral sand, once saturated with water, becomes a flowing mud. The problem after the eruption of the mountain was that, with continuing rain, the millions of tonnes of this mineral sand on the sides of the mountain in all directions flow further down into the valleys, literally engulfing villages, agricultural land, roadways and all of the infrastructure of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has, through AIDAB, given equipment to monitor the extent of the flow and to determine an analysis about where to best put dykes to limit the damage from the lahar flow. That equipment is working&mdash;we saw it&mdash;but further attention needs to be given by Australia's representatives and the Australian government to cooperating with the Philippines government to put some of that analysis into practice. There is, if you like, a ready plan but a failure to demonstrate action that will maximise the advantages for the local people. If we are serious about the value of the analysis that we have been able to provide and which is greatly appreciated&mdash;in fact, it is seen as the best mapping techniques that are available anywhere in the Philippines&mdash;we should enable more to be achieved in the practical engineering in recommendations flowing from the analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Philippines the delegation met with the Commission on Elections, which still carries the full democratic objectives of the Corazon Aquino period. We also met with the Commission on Human Rights, about which I could say the same. We were inspired by the commissioners of these two important institutions and the continuing work for good electoral practice and for human rights which is so much supported in this parliament, indeed by the nation of Australia. In recommendations 11 and 12 of the report we have urged that there be open consultation between the Australian equivalent of these two important institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to the Peace Panel, whereby the Philippines has taken a quite positive step to have discussions with three dissident groups. Parts of these dissident groups are armed and are armed insurrectionists against the government of the Philippines. One is the New Peoples Army&mdash;the old communist guerrilla group; the second, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the south; and the third, a right wing officers' group within the army. The discussions involve trying to win over these three groups to take part in the normal peaceful political process of the Philippines. We were greatly impressed by the clear objectives of that commission that has the backing of President Ramos. We certainly wish the heightened democracy that is to flow from this initiative every success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with President Ramos and other ministers during our visit, and our references to that are in the report. In Indonesia we had three major stops at Jakarta, Surabaya and Dili in East Timor. I strongly recommend that any continuing delegations visiting Indonesia also visit the capital, a regional commercial area, and then an eastern islands area&mdash;in much the same way that was so successfully part of this delegation's experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surabaya has a strong sister state relationship with Perth in Western Australia, and the Western Australian government now has a full-time commissioner in Surabaya. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), a former minister for industry, John Button, and this delegation have visited Surabaya. It is a major concentration of some 30 million people with some quite high technology investments and some hopeful projects, such as in shipbuilding and aviation, which the minister for technology, Minister Habibi, has initiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must in Australia have such a careful knowledge of our neighbours and of the opportunities for Australia that we do not go only to capital or traditional cities, like Jogjakarta, but that we go to major economic centres such as Surabaya. We need to see from this example of the Western Australia link with Surabaya what additional steps can be taken for similar relationships to the advantage of Australia and Indonesia. I certainly support recommendation 16, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation recommends the Commonwealth Government continue to reinforce Surabaya-Perth (WA) links and that Australian government and business representatives continue to develop their activities in the Surabaya region.</PARA>
<PARA>I come to what is in many ways the area of our visit that has gained the most attention&mdash;our time in East Timor. We were the first Australian parliamentarians to visit East Timor since the terrible events of the Dili massacre. Therefore, all seven pages of our report that relate to East Timor&mdash;as they are published today for the first time&mdash;should be read most carefully by all senators and members and, indeed, by members of the Australian public who are interested in what we did there and in what we have recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were able to meet with President Soeharto in Jakarta and we had one hour of discussion, not least about East Timor, human rights and a stable and prosperous outcome for the people of East Timor. It is the Australian government's policy and was the preceding Liberal-National Party policy, which is in no way challenged by us in the delegation or, indeed, as I hear it, by any emerging group within Australia, that we see East Timor as part of Indonesia. We are not putting that question into our minds at all. I know that Portugal has that view in the current hearing in the international court at the moment, but it is an established policy of almost 20 years now that East Timor is seen by the Australia government and the majority of Australian parliamentarians as a part of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it be equally understood that I do not know one member of the Australian parliament who has less than the  highest regard for the rights of the people of East Timor to have a prosperous, stable and peaceful life and for their culture, their language and their religion to be secure. That is very much my view, and we found that steps need to be taken within Indonesia, directed by the central government of Indonesia, to further enhance those concerns being addressed and satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with Governor Soares; we also met with the speaker of the local parliament in Dili; we met with the commander of the army in Dili and other senior officers of the Indonesian army; and we also specifically met all of the Australian development assistance workers serving AIDAB in three main projects&mdash;an agricultural project, a water resources project and a veterinary project. A fourth project in technical education is in the pipeline. We have recommended not only endorsement of the AIDAB activities that are proceeding but that the third project, the veterinary project, be extended by having East Timorese people trained, with our assistance, in other parts of Indonesia where suitable veterinary training is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core recommendation, and the most important politically in our whole report, is recommendation 19, which relates to a special status for East Timor within Indonesia. It is the view of the governor and of Bishop Belo, whom one of our delegation was able to meet&mdash;that is, the church&mdash;that the central government of Indonesia ought to give a green light to discussions to determine a special status within Indonesia for East Timor. The word `autonomy' comes to our mind. It was not a word that was directly used by the governor, but I believe that Governor Soares and Bishop Belo are right and are representative of the people in East Timor in seeking sufficient special status or&mdash;using my term&mdash;autonomy within Indonesia that guarantees culture, religion and participation in the public service and other areas of the community in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have called on the government of Indonesia to reduce the number of military and police personnel in East Timor to the more generally prevailing numbers in other areas of Indonesia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President. The introduction of this bill, together with the two others that are part of the same package, are to replace the Audit Act 1901. That act is one of the few Commonwealth laws that  has operated continuously since it was passed by this Parliament in its first Session after Federation. Its intended replacement, therefore, represents something of a landmark in the history of Commonwealth financial administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Act is not being replaced simply because it is old. In fact, it has proved remarkably robust over its 93-year life in providing for the procedural framework for Commonwealth financial administration and for the audit of the Commonwealth's activities. But too many of its basic concepts and structures reflect their Nineteenth Century origins to an extent that ignores and, in some cases, even impedes modern management practice and contemporary expectations for public sector accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These limitations were recognised by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the course of its comprehensive inquiry into the operations of the Audit Office. In its Report 296, tabled in April 1989, the JCPA recommended that the Audit Act 1901 be replaced with more modern legislation, with separate acts to deal with auditing and financial administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In giving effect to that recommendation, the Government believes that clarity would be  served best through the adoption of three new acts. It is proposed that there be an Auditor-General Act to provide for the powers and functions of the Auditor-General. In relation to financial administration, however, Commonwealth bodies differ according to the basic legal financial status that each one has&mdash;namely, whether the body has the legal capacity, in its own right, to acquire ownership of money and other assets coming into its possession, or whether it acts only as a financial and custodial agent for the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of such money and assets. Consequently, it is proposed that there be a Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act to specify certain matters that are to apply to the operations of  financially autonomous bodies&mdash;that is, Commonwealth bodies that have legal ownership of money in their own right; and a Financial Management and Accountability Act, to apply to the financial operations of agencies&mdash;that is, Commonwealth bodies that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth  in that the bodies acquire no legal ownership of the money that they raise and spend. That money,  in the Constitutional sense, directly comprises the `Treasury of the Commonwealth'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, you may be aware that, upon introduction of the package of these three bills into the House of Representatives, the House agreed that the legislative package be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its consideration and advisory report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JCPA Report 331 tabled on 22 September 1994 is the result of that process. I believe that the Committee is to be commended for its quality analysis and recommendations, the great majority of which the Government has accepted and which have now been incorporated into the respective bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now wish to provide an outline of the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed act  is concerned with the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It will specify responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it will provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and, thereby, allow them to be held accountable. The proposed law will add substance to the spirit of the public sector financial reforms that have been a feature of this Government's administration over the last decade. At the same time,  the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control and, where possible,  to clarify and simplify them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definitions of "Agency", "Chief Executive", "official", "public money" and "public property", between them, describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation&mdash;regulations and Finance Minister's Orders&mdash;to provide procedural substance for the day-to-day application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act 1901 for regulations and Finance Directions, except that, unlike Finance Directions which are administrative in character, provision is made for Finance Minister's Orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which Chief Executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act will preserve the unique role of the Minister for Finance, which is central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The Finance Minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the Constitutional `Treasury of the Commonwealth' so that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that Office. The Finance Minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money; to make Orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money; and to its investment. The existing power under the Audit Act 1901 to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short term cash management tools&mdash;overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and Cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by Parliament through appropriations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The Trust Fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act 1901 is to be abolished and replaced by two, purpose-based, Funds&mdash;the Reserved Money Fund and the Commercial Activities Fund. Apart from  components of the Reserved Money Fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two Funds will be established or varied by Finance Minister's determinations. The effect of such  determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or Loan Fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent. Since the spending of money from such a Fund is, in all respects, an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the Finance Minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of Parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of Trust Accounts under the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments of public money, including debiting a Fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of "Drawing Rights", to be issued by the Finance Minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by Parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the Executive Government to spend, always specify the Fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a timeframe. It would be a breach of section 83 of the Constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the Finance Minister has no capacity to issue valid Drawing Rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law; and makes it an indictable offence for an official or Minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid Drawing Right. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act would create a standing appropriation out of which rewards could be paid in certain circumstances for information furnished that led to the apprehension of persons defrauding the Commonwealth. The Government acknowledges that there is a range of viewpoints as to whether it is appropriate to pay rewards&mdash;even in the limited circumstances envisaged by this provision in the bill. The decision to include it, however, was taken only after carefully considering the issues and it reflects the Government's strong commitment to deter and detect fraud against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act would put into the principal legislation the powers that are presently carried only in Finance Regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for Parliamentary Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Audit Act 1901 is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on Chief Executives of Agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their Agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish Audit Committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the Finance Minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from Agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, it is proposed that Chief Executives be permitted to sub-delegate to officials any of the act's Finance Minister's powers or functions, unless the Minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such sub-delegation. These arrangements for sub-delegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief Executives are better placed than the Finance Minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks. It will thus be practicable to hold Chief Executives accountable to the Finance Minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the Finance Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government believes that this proposed law represents a significant landmark in sharpening and strengthening  the framework of Commonwealth financial administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 is one of three bills forming the package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills were introduced into the House of Representatives on 29 June 1994, by the Minister for Finance, the Honourable Kim C. Beazley, MP. After their first reading, the bills were referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for review and for an advisory report. The Committee reported to the House on 22 September 1994 (JCPA Report No.331 refers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government moved a number of amendments to this package of legislation to pick up issues that were considered following the report on the three bills by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and these amendments were passed by the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to replace and enhance Part XI of the Audit Act 1901, which currently provides standard financial provisions for Commonwealth authorities and certain other bodies. It is also intended in due course that the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act will replace individual financial provisions contained in the enabling legislation of authorities not subject to Part XI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the underlying purpose of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to replace, with a single set of requirements, the myriad of variations on a similar theme scattered throughout the enabling legislation of Commonwealth authorities and the constitutions of Commonwealth companies. The approach proposed by this bill would enable the accountability requirements of Commonwealth controlled bodies to be viewed as a whole and should significantly streamline the focus of the Government's and the Parliament's interest in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, the bill proposes a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of `Commonwealth authorities' and sets out standards of conduct for executive officers. Many of these requirements are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities. The bill also proposes a single set of requirements for ensuring that `wholly-owned Commonwealth companies' keep Ministers and the Parliament informed of their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, Mr President, this bill seeks to extend the mandate of the Auditor-General to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth authorities and companies, and their subsidiaries, without exception. At the same time it would modernise the requirements for the Auditor-General's reports on authorities making them consistent with those required by the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some areas, the bill traverses ground that is covered, to varying degrees, in the enabling legislation of authorities and the constitutional documents of companies. These areas of overlap will be removed by consequential amendments to the enabling legislation and are contained in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1995 to be introduced into the Senate these sittings. Similarly, it is intended to replace areas of overlap in the memoranda and articles of association of Commonwealth companies with cross-references to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the bill, a `Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A `Commonwealth company' is one in which the Commonwealth has a direct controlling interest (that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor-General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the Parliament. However, only `wholly-owned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies. This reflects the difficulty&mdash;in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders&mdash;of imposing a general regime which requires the provision of certain reports, documents and information only to Ministers, namely, a risk of oppression actions under the Corporations Law by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and a report by the Auditor-General on the financial statements. The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders and the directors and the Auditor-General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a `true and fair view' of the matters required to be report ed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should mention, Mr President, that the proposed obligations on directors, as individuals, will replace more general obligations on authorities under existing arrangements. This approach is similar in principle to that applied to companies by the Corporations Law and is intended to clarify the accountability arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also mention that the Finance Minister's Orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the Parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible Minister a copy of their annual report, or annual general meeting documents, which the Minister must in turn table in each House of the Parliament. In the case of Commonwealth companies that are not wholly-owned the Minister must table their annual reports as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting. This requirement recognises that, where there are shareholders other than the Commonwealth, it is reasonable to allow all the shareholders in general meeting the opportunity to consider the annual report before it is tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Finance Minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned companies to prepare half-yearly or quarterly financial statements. The statements must be given to the responsible Minister within 2 months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each House as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim financial statements will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as Government Business Enterprises (GBEs). Of course, as the Government, from time to time, develops new approaches to providing the services now provided by GBEs, there may be a need to look again at how the proposed act will apply to those bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors will be required to keep the responsible Minister informed of the operations of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned companies, including their subsidiaries, and to give the responsible Minister and the Finance Minister such reports, documents and information as they may require.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Finance Minister requires such reports, documents and information it is intended that, in the normal course, he or she will first consult with the responsible Minister and provide a copy of such reports or documents to that Minister. Such consultative arrangements have not been included in the bill because of long standing policy, reaffirmed by successive governments, that, as a general rule, the internal operations of government should not be reflected in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors must also notify the responsible Minister of certain proposed activities such as significant acquisitions or disposals of shares or businesses, changes in business activities or involvement in partnerships, trusts or joint ventures. However, the responsible Minister may give written guidelines as to the coverage of the matters to be notified and may in writing exempt the directors from notifying particulars of proposals to form or participate in the formation of a company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors of a Government Business Enterprise, whether constituted as an authority or a company, must prepare a corporate plan at least once a year and give it to the responsible Minister. This is a key planning document that will provide the responsible Minister with financial and other performance information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to the governance of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It proposes that the responsible Minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them of general policies of the Government that are capable of being applied to the authority or company concerned. The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company. This provision is intended to cover government policies that are applicable to the Commonwealth public sector in general, such as, for example, policies relating to trade contact with foreign countries or equal employment opportunity.  Nevertheless, in recognition of their special roles, and so as to avoid any misconceptions insofar as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service are concerned, the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1995 will make it abundantly clear that this provision cannot affect the content or scheduling of programs of those bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that directors must establish and maintain an audit committee. The Government views this as a step in improving internal control and communication within Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned companies as well as the accountability of their management. It will also ensure that directors have appropriate assistance in the discharge of their accounting and financial reporting obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the Government's response to a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its 1989 report on Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements, the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries does anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the Parliament from passing legislation to empower a subsidiary to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of its parent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill imposes standards of conduct on executive officers of Commonwealth authorities broadly equivalent to the standards already imposed on executive officers of companies by the Corporations Law. Executive officers include directors and any other persons who are concerned in, or take part in, the management of the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, the bill provides that `executive officers' must at all times act honestly and exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of their powers and the discharge of their duties. Also, an executive officer, or former executive officer, must not make improper use of inside information, or of his or her position as an executive officer, in order to gain an advantage for any person, either directly or indirectly, or cause detriment to the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both criminal and civil sanctions are provided for contravention of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a director of a Commonwealth authority who has an interest in a matter that is being considered, or about to be considered, by the Board, must, as soon as possible after he or she becomes aware of the situation, disclose the nature of the interest concerned at a meeting of the Board. The director must not participate in deliberations on the matter concerned unless the Board or the responsible Minister determines otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, in accordance with the Government's response to another recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report on Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements, the bill provides that the responsible Minister shall table in each House particulars of any new or varied direct Commonwealth interest in a company. The particulars required are to be prescribed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the proposals put forward in this bill will have no direct impact on Government revenues or outlays. However, I am confident that, through the implementation of a more streamlined and consistent operational and accountability framework for Commonwealth authorities and companies, improved performance and value for money will be achieved both for the Commonwealth and Australians generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President. This bill is one of the package of three bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. The other two bills are the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purposes of the Auditor-General Bill 1994 are to continue the statutory Office of the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia; to specify the powers and functions of the Auditor-General; to establish the Australian National Audit Office; and to provide, in turn, for the independent audit of the Australian National Audit Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill draws heavily on the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) in Report 296&mdash;"The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament". The effect of the bill's proposed provisions will be to support the continued functional and professional independence of  the Auditor-General from the Executive Government. The corollary is that the Auditor-General's special relationship with the Parliament is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I  now wish to provide an outline of the proposed Auditor-General Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill specifies there is to be an Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia and details the appointment and conditions of the Office. The Auditor-General will continue to be appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the appropriate Minister&mdash;which, under the Administrative Arrangements Orders, will be the Prime Minister. Under arrangements proposed in this bill, prior to advising the Governor-General, the Prime Minister must consult with the Finance Minister, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition, the Chairman of the JCPA and the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Parliament, when established. The bill also includes provisions for the removal of the Auditor-General by the Governor-General following a petition by both Houses of the Parliament in the same session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General has a broad mandate to be enshrined in legislation, replacing the existing arrangements whereby the Auditor-General's mandate is only partly derived from legislation and partly from Government policy. The Auditor-General will have a mandate to undertake the audit of the financial statements of all Commonwealth bodies. In addition, the Auditor-General may undertake performance audits of the operations of Commonwealth bodies at his or her discretion, the only exception being in respect of Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) where the accountability framework established by the Government requires GBEs to focus on performance and to improve the return to the Commonwealth as shareholder. Despite the focus on performance by GBEs, the Government nevertheless proposes that Parliament or a Minister may request the Auditor-General to carry out a performance audit of a GBE or GBE subsidiary, provided that, if the body concerned is a company, it is a company wholly-owned by the Commonwealth. In this regard, the Government has reflected on the need to continue the principle, as already accepted under the Audit Act 1901, of forbearance in consideration of the investment interests of private shareholders in partially privatised Commonwealth companies.  Performance audits are an extra feature on the  accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high Parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The  bill seeks to permit the Auditor-General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits, or to provide services that are of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. These arrangements would be at the discretion of the Auditor-General and be undertaken where he or she considers there is a benefit to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that the Auditor-General and authorised officials have full and free access to information, documents and premises. These powers are considerable in their scope, but are necessary if the Auditor-General is to fulfil his or her obligations to the Parliament. The information gathering powers are complemented with strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing an Auditor-General function.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill seeks to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority with the sole function of assisting the Auditor-General. The staff of the Australian National Audit Office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, as a reflection of its status as a core public service. Nevertheless, should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to be augmented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor-General's flexibility to engage any person&mdash;for example, to contract with auditors or other specialists from the private sector&mdash;to assist in the performance of an Auditor-General function. The Government sees the establishment of the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority as an important symbolic step to demonstrate its commitment to the independence of the Auditor-General and his or her office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the bill would establish the office of Independent Auditor who is the Parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. It provides for the appointment and conditions of the Office which, as far as are appropriate, mirror those of the Auditor-General in relation to his or her audit functions for the balance of the Common wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Independent Auditor is to be a part-time statutory officer appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the appropriate Minister who will have first consulted with the Chairman of the JCPA and the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Parliament, when established. The Independent Auditor is to hold qualifications and have the experience determined necessary by the Minister after consultation with the Chairman of the JCPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as previously indicated, the Government has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the JCPA in framing this legislation. While the Committee's recommendations have not been taken up in their entirety, the provisions of this bill and the complementary provisions in the other two bills in the package ensure that the Auditor-General can fulfil, independently, the role demanded by  this Parliament, and with all the professional and functional freedom required for the task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General plays a vital role in giving credibility to Australia's system of Parliamentary governance and this legislation will preserve and strengthen that role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate in that act three Excise Tariff Proposals that have been previously tabled in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 of 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 of the bill proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene of 1.977 cents per litre and a decrease in the excise duty payable on topped crude oil of 2.977 cents per litre. These changes were announced in the 1994-95 Budget and are effective from 11 May 1994. Clause 3 of the bill proposes to remove topped crude oil from the 1 cent per litre increase in excise duty of 1 August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decrease in excise duty on these products is proposed to partly offset the 3 cents per litre increase in excise duty on these products that was announced in the 1993-94 Budget. The proposed decrease is in response to representations from industry that the increase in excise duty on fuel oil has had significant impact on input costs of certain export oriented mining and mineral processing operations and the coastal shipping industry. Topped crude oil was subject to a further 1 cent per litre increase in excise duty on 1 February 1994, independent of indexation, and a further increase of 1 cent per litre was scheduled for 1 August 1994. The decrease in excise duty on topped crude oil, which can be used as a substitute for fuel oil, will also re-align topped crude oil with the excise duty on fuel oil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 of the bill proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable on aviation gasoline (avgas) and an increase in the excise duty payable on aviation kerosene (avtur). The decrease in the excise duty on avgas is a net reduction of 6.327 cents per litre and is the combination of a 1.194 cents per litre increase and a 7.521 cents per litre decrease in excise duty. The 1.194 cents per litre increase is a continuation of the phase in arrangements for cost recovery with respect to air safety regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority which commenced in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act 1994. The 7.521 cents per litre decrease is the result of revised costing arrangements by the Civil Aviation Authority for airways services provided for avgas powered aircraft. This decrease recognises that a large proportion of Civil Aviation Authority facilities are provided in respect of public transport operations mostly undertaken by avtur powered aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1.194 cents per litre increase in the excise duty on avtur is a continuation of the phase in arrangements for cost recovery with respect to air safety regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority commenced in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A long term funding strategy for aviation safety regulation is being developed by the Civil Aviation Authority in consultation with the aviation industry to apply from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 of 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the bill proposes to exempt certain uses of stabilised crude petroleum oil and condensate from excise duty. It proposes to impose excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil and condensate only for use as a fuel otherwise than where for use as a fuel in the recovery, production, transportation or refining of stabilised crude oil or condensate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 of 1994</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decrease of 2.977 cents per litre in the excise duty on topped crude petroleum oil will result in a reduction of revenue of $2 million in 1994-95 and $2 million in 1995-96.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Life Insurance Bill 1994 and the Life Insurance (Consequential Amendments and Repeals) Bill 1994. The Life Insurance (Consequential Amendments and Repeals) Bill repeals two previous acts concerned with levies&mdash;the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Act 1991 and the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Act 1991. Honourable senators may recall that one of these acts deals with the dreadful saga associated with the Occidental and Regal Life fiasco. We are reminded that the levies will no longer be required. Therefore, it is not surprising that this act has been repealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I use this opportunity of reminding honourable senators that not all policy holders are happy. There are still some outstanding issues in relation to this Occidental-Regal fiasco. There are still a lot of questions asked and people believe that they still have not received their correct entitlement. I ask the government to attend to these issues I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to amend something like 17 further acts of parliament that have references to life insurance matters within them. The bill also updates annual report requirements of the commissioner and puts pressure on the Treasurer in terms of disclosure and disclosing responsibilities to the parliament in a timely fashion. The bill gives added protection to the savings of policy holders and adds additional supervisory costs in the process. The supervisory levy will rise to about $70,000 per company, more than 2 1/2 times the previous fee. There is also the establishment of actuarial standards. It is intended to develop actuarial standards with the object of tightening prudential controls and instituting uniform rules. Solvency and capital adequacy measures will also be tightened, which is overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, since the bill was first introduced, there have been two further sets of amendments&mdash;the latest arriving this morning. Industry representatives, through LIFA, assure me that that organisation has had very close consultation and that all the amendments give effect to the previous concerns of the industry, although at times the language may not be what the industry required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two bills that the Senate is debating are not the end of the story so far as life insurance is concerned. It is a pity that it could not have been presented as a package and as an integrated whole. As I mentioned, since they were first introduced we have had two sets of supplementary amendments. They are two issues still outstanding which will require legislation. One relates to consumer protection. Undoubtedly, this will cost life companies money and, at the same time, provide a greater measure of protection to consumer interests. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also to be finalised is a code of conduct in relation to the practices of life writers. I hardly need to remind honourable senators that life writer membership has been decimated in recent years, with traditional life insurance companies going through some massive restructuring. Before that bill in relation to the code of practice comes before the parliament, issues have to be satisfied as to whether the government agency should be responsible for regulating agents or life underwriters, or whether the life companies themselves should be responsible, or whether there should be self-regulation by the agents themselves. These issues are yet to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to go through the main bill in great detail. However, I would like to refer to the contributions of members in the House of Representatives. I particularly draw attention to the contributions made by members on our side of politics&mdash;my colleagues David Connolly, Allan Rocher and Alan Cadman. Seeing that there is nothing contentious in these issues, which were largely of a mechanical nature, it is not the appropriate role of the Senate to repeat them, except to draw attention to certain concerns and new issues that we believe should arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the government and its representatives on the fact that, on this occasion, they have had very extensive consultations with the industry. When we were looking at a previous bill in relation to general insurance, it took some time before that consultation reached a desirable level. However, with that experience behind them, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the other representatives from government have consulted widely within the industry and appropriately have responded. The latest series of amendments, which were tabled for the first time today, reflect what can be done when we adopt such a cooperative approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that this life bill is perhaps the third in a row flowing from very comprehensive changes which were made in the area of superannuation, general insurance and now life insurance. Perhaps a valid criticism from the industry is the concern about directors' responsibilities. Certainly, those responsibilities actually exceed those which were imposed upon trustees or directors under general corporate law. However, there has been some moderation in terms of due diligence concepts which have been introduced as a result of amendments. For example, amendment 5 clarifies the duty of a company to act reasonably, based on the circumstances at the time of its activities and its decisions, and considering the interests of policy holders, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concept of acting reasonably takes away what was previously there in terms of the absolute guidance which these sorts of provisions are intended to give to the courts when interpreting disputed issues. As a result of the latest series of 13 amendments, I think what the government and the ISC intend is a lot clearer to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining outcomes, courts look to the legislation for the sorts of guidelines the parliament expected in terms of interpretation. I think this is a very desirable message to send to courts. Taken away is the concept of benefit in hindsight because in hindsight we can always be very clever. What is important is that at the time the decisions were taken, the people who have responsibilities in this area, namely the directors, acted reasonably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to take additional time of the Senate, but instead refer my colleagues to the excellent contributions made in the House of Representatives which encapsulate the issues very satisfactorily. I hope the government continues to consult widely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bills before us today establish a new regulatory framework for the life insurance industry. I say at the outset that the Democrats have no difficulty with this legislation and will be supporting it. The key provisions have been well rehearsed already, both here and in the other place. Essentially, the industry will have to meet new solvency and reporting requirements. The industry will also be subjected to a higher level of supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of fairness and constructive debate, I say here, as has already been said, that there has been considerable consultation. It does appear to have been one of the government's better efforts in actually getting out and listening to people and then taking what it has heard on board and making significant improvements in legislation. I should perhaps qualify that statement just a little by saying that we have had instances in the past where apparently solid pieces of complex legislation have failed in unexpected ways. But perhaps what I can say is that if there are any traps in this legislation they have been well hidden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one concern the Democrats have relates to what is not in this bill rather than what is in it. In August last year the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Elliott, released a draft code of practice governing the sale of life insurance. His statement announced the government's intention to finalise the code in time for the passage of this legislation. The idea was to make it enforceable and disallowable by way of new consumer protection provisions to be incorporated in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turns out that the code and the amendments have not been finalised and will now have to be dealt with under amending legislation at some later date. My information is that draft legislation has been circulated confidentially and that the code is being finalised through a couple of parallel processes. So it now is not clear just when the consumer protection measures will come before this chamber. What is clear is that they are likely to be more contentious than the prudential legislation we are debating today. I say again: it is most unfortunate that we are not able to debate all of these measures, all of the reforms, in their entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spend a little time outlining our concerns with the draft code that we have seen and making it very clear what we will be looking for when the consumer legislation is debated. The draft code contains a number of important provisions which implement recommendations of the Trade Practices Commission inquiry into life insurance and superannuation. They require a needs analysis to be formed before a sale is made, a record of customer advice to be kept and various matters to be disclosed, including the method by which life agents are remunerated. This last provision backs away from the TPC recommendation that agents' fees and commissions be disclosed, but it is nevertheless an important step forward. The competency of life insurance intermediaries is also to be dealt with by a system of records and references and there is a requirement that they demonstrate basic knowledge and skills. Finally, the code sets out the conditions to be met by internal and external complaints handling mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the extent to which the life insurance industry lifts its game depends in large part on the strength of the external complaints handling mechanism. The draft code spells out criteria by which the Insurance and Superannuation Commission must judge the adequacy of external mechanisms, but they are far too vague for comfort. For example, an external complaints system must be `independent of the parties to the complaint', but that is not specific enough to judge whether the existing industry scheme, the Life Insurance Complaints Board, would qualify. This is a matter of some concern, given that the Access to Justice Advisory Committee found that the board `would be unlikely to comply with standards relating to independence from the industry'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft code also requires that the scheme be `effectively promoted'. What does this mean? In the case of telecommunications, the Democrats obtained a ministerial undertaking that every phone customer receive a customer charter telling them, among other things, that they can lodge complaints with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. Should not information of this kind be part of every life insurance policy package? Surely that should be one requirement of the code. I do not believe parliament can give proper consideration to a code which leaves important questions like this unanswered in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern which has been put by the consumer movement is that a system which looks fine on paper will fail to work if real resources are not put into monitoring and enforcement. I understand that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission intends putting minimal resources into checking the extent to which life companies comply with the code. Overseas experience suggests that the results of a hands-off approach could well be widespread ignorance and non-compliance amongst intermediaries. Signals have also been sent out that the ISC's intention is to prosecute only as an absolute last resort. Again, my advice is that this approach did not work in the United Kingdom and that a more aggressively regulatory approach has now had to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by repeating that, while we support the bill, we look forward with some concern to the consumer provisions which were to have formed part of this package. I take this opportunity to ask the parliamentary secretary: can he advise what the government's timetable is; when will we see at least that confidential draft; and when will legislation be before this place? We do really need to see far more commitment to detail and a commitment to more regulatory processes than we have seen so far in the rough draft. </PARA>

It seeks to clarify that the act is not to apply in a way which would exceed the Commonwealth's power and provides for the exemption of various types of tobacco advertisements from the operation of the act. The opposition will be not opposing this bill but, in doing so, I would like to record something of the history of the bill and also some criticism of the timing of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation imposing restrictions on the marketing and promotion of tobacco products has been progressively enacted in both the Commonwealth and state spheres since 1976. The first legislative restriction on the promotion of tobacco products was the 1976 amendment to the Broadcasting Act 1942. This introduced a prohibition on the broadcasting on radio and television of advertisements for tobacco products, except as an accident or incidental accompaniment to other matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This broadcasting prohibition, while appearing, prima facie, to prevent tobacco advertising on television, in fact did not do so. The exemption for accidental or incidental advertising enabled the continuation of the broadcasting of events such as the Benson and Hedges World Series Cricket, the Winfield Cup and the arts, without infringing the prohibition, and provided an effective loophole through which tobacco companies were able to achieve significant exposure by increasing their sponsorship funding of sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that time onwards various enactments of legislation have ensued, culminating most recently in the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act which was enacted on 24 December 1992 and which prohibited the broadcast or publication, knowingly or recklessly, of tobacco advertisements after 1 July 1993. That brings us to the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of this legislation, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill, has been brought about by the Philip Morris case. The bill amounts to a recognition of the possible invalidity of the act as presently drafted. The passing of the amendments will not stop the Philip Morris challenge of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge focuses on the right of the industry to communicate on political and government matters and to engage in many ordinary business communications. The legislation will enable companies to legitimately use their corporate logo, communicate on political and government matters, engage in many ordinary corporate communications and undertake activities such as a court imposed recall of a defective product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This challenge was instituted on 6 June 1994: Philip Morris Ltd instituted an action in the High Court challenging the constitutional validity of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act. One of its grounds was that it was beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth, for example, that a law which prohibits traders from advertising their tobacco products is not a law with respect to trading corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present bill cleans up a raft of unintended consequences as a result of poor consultation&mdash;and there was very little consultation&mdash;and, importantly, poor drafting. It also is a consequence of the speedy passage of the 1992 act. The opposition wants to have this on record: if more adequate prior consultation and better drafting had occurred in the development of that act, it would not be necessary now for this bill to be before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our parliamentary actions have been primarily directed towards ensuring that governments should take all possible steps to prohibit the use of tobacco products. The most recent actions taken by the Democrats include the introduction last year of my private senator's bill and also the establishment of a Senate inquiry into the tobacco industry. That inquiry is now well under way and, in accordance with the terms of reference that I moved last year, the community affairs committee is looking into two crucial areas: firstly, the current level of regulation covering the manufacture, advertising, promotion and sale of tobacco products; and, secondly, the costs of tobacco related illness to the Australian community and a review of existing mechanisms for recouping those costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into what the committee has been doing in any great detail, except to say that submissions already received and in many cases released have come from a range of leading health organisations as well as the tobacco companies. There have been submissions from tobacco growers, health workers and many individuals who are concerned about this issue, including those in the research area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the most interesting pieces of evidence to come forward has been about the tobacco companies' push into Asia and the Pacific. Now that they find themselves heavily regulated and beginning to lose their market penetration in Australia, they are moving to target our neighbours; they are targeting them in the way they are not allowed to do here. In some of those countries, the number of young people and children taking up smoking is truly staggering; that will have a huge impact on health costs in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australia can actually do about that is something, no doubt, the committee itself will be deliberating on and discussing. But surely, at the very least, we should be setting an example in this area; we should be setting the lead in our immediate region by getting as tough as we possibly can on the advertising of cigarette products within our own boarders. There has been generally, I think, a very constructive and cooperative approach by all parties to the Senate inquiry. That does lead us to be reasonably confident that we will see, out of this, additional regulation on the advertising of tobacco products in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why we are not moving any of the dozens of amendments that I am sure the Democrats and many others believe now need to be moved is that we believe we should wait for this committee to report. We accept the assurances from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that she will look, in detail and at length, at what we do recommend when the report comes down later this year; that this report simply will not be shelved; and that we will be seeing a tightening up to make sure that there are no longer any loopholes or open doors whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need, obviously, to look at a whole range of other issues, including some of the new ways by which tobacco companies are promoting their products, such as give-aways and inducements&mdash;particularly for very young children&mdash;such as the collection of very attractive presents and bonuses if they buy or subscribe in any way to tobacco products or any material put out by tobacco companies. We have to prevent young people from becoming the targets of cigarette advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to make sure that tobacco companies are not able to get around the intent of legislation that has been brought into this place time and time again. We need legislation that is very clear and not open to challenge&mdash;and I acknowledge the role of this piece of legislation we have before us today&mdash;which ensures that no tobacco advertising means no tobacco advertising; that we do not have in place any mechanisms whatsoever that can be used by companies to get around that and, in particular, target young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have to ensure that people understand that there is no safe level or form of tobacco use. Indeed, it is time to reject claims that advertising is actually targeted at encouraging people to maintain brand loyalty or switch brands rather than take up smoking in the first place. I conclude by saying that I am confident that the Senate inquiry into the tobacco industry will result in a strong and definitive report and that we will see some very tough recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)That, in accordance, with the recommendation contained in the Procedure committee second report of 1994, the sessional order of 2 February 1994 relating to the times of meeting and routine of business be amended by adding after paragraph (8) the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)Where a motion is moved by leave in relation to a document presented to the Senate, including a document presented to the President when the Senate is not sitting, a senator speaking to such a motion shall not speak for more than 10 minutes, and debate on the motion shall not exceed 30 minutes; where two or more such motions are moved in succession, debate on all motions shall not exceed 60 minutes; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)That this change to the sessional order have effect on and from 27 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has brought on this Procedure Committee report for debate principally to obtain the Senate's agreement to recommendations relating to the presentation of documents and debate by leave. As mentioned in the committee's report, debates on motions to take note of documents which are moved by leave are occasionally extensive and sometimes have a severe impact on the time available for other business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view, the impact on time for other business is exacerbated, because there is no certainty about debating time on documents; therefore, no coherent planning for the time for that day can be done to anticipate such debates. I suppose, if one was in any doubt about that, one has only to count the quorums called when senators anticipated to be speaking are not here and available. The most civilised way that we have to get senators here on time is by calling a quorum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that committee reports can be debated on Wednesday and Thursday mornings, and further time is available on Thursday afternoons should senators wish to continue their remarks. The government supports the committee's proposal because it provides greater programming certainty, it allows adequate time for consideration of documents when they are tabled and it provides flexibility because, if several documents are presented, arrangements can be made by agreement in advance about the allocation of those documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think this will allow us to consider prioritising the debate about which documents come up and so on. I have certainly been in here on a number of occasions when senators wanted to take note of certain reports and documents, yet it has not been sorted out which report four senators want to speak on, as apart from one that somebody wants to make only some brief remarks on. Certainly, I believe that any assistance to help organise priorities in this place is to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also notes that, if the recommendation is adopted, the Procedure Committee will review the operation of the new arrangements. In short, the government supports this proposal and urges the Senate to adopt the committee's recommendation, with effect from 27 February, which will be, I suspect, by the time we return, if not at the end of that first week. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude on this side of the chamber to these procedural matters has always been that it is up to each individual senator to make up his or her mind. We do not ply a whip to matters of procedure. No doubt the government does because it plies whips to any matter. Our concern is that this is a just a further restraint on the opportunities for senators to contribute to debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to this chamber. He does not actually believe in accountability to the parliament. He regards this chamber as a nuisance which he has to put up with. We actually have a different view. We believe that government should be responsible to both chambers of the parliament. Because he has the numbers in the other place, the House of Representatives cannot assume the responsibility of accountability. The only chamber within the Australian parliament that in any way attempts to keep a government responsible is this chamber. To do so senators have to have time for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the standing orders are to be constantly amended in a way to further restrict the opportunity for senators to contribute and restrict their speaking times, then the capacity for the Senate to hold a government accountable is therefore obviously further limited. That is what concerns us about the deal between the government and the Australian Democrats to further restrict the opportunity and time for each and every senator to contribute in a debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go through recent history, we recall that under this deal they cut back the time limits for matters of public importance and matters of urgency from two hours to one hour. They cut back the time for the adjournment debate. They also cut back the speaking time in ordinary debates. It is a trend that has been apparent for some time. The attitude of the Australian Democrats is that, if an argument cannot be put in less time, then it is not worth putting. That completely overlooks the development of an argument. We find that unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two parts to this proposal. There is no doubt that some of the documents introduced in this chamber are of vital importance. If we adopt this proposal, what we are saying is that no senator shall speak for more than 10 minutes and the debate should not continue for more than 30 minutes. Basically, what is being said is that if each senator speaks for the full time, only three senators will have the opportunity to contribute. I suppose if we had a strict rotation on party size, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine would never have an opportunity to contribute in any debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this necessary? Has the case for restricting speaking time in debates on documents to no more than 10 minutes been made? There was been no attempt on the part of the minister to make out that case today. What is the argument in favour of saying that senators cannot speak for longer than 10 minutes on a matter that might be of vital national importance? What is the argument for saying that, within a whole program, debate on a document should be limited to 30 minutes no matter how important that document might be? Again the case has not been made out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where should the onus lie? We say that the Senate should start with the principle of freedom of speech and opportunity to contribute. Those who want to further restrict that should have the onus upon them to make out their argument. No attempt has been made to do so in this instance. Therefore, speaking for myself, although I am pleased that the issue has been brought before the chamber&mdash;that is why I am a party to the Procedure Committee's report&mdash;I will not support it because I believe senators should have the opportunity to make a full contribution to matters of importance, and debate about documents can be matters of importance.

Why they always side with the government to further restrict the rights of senators to contribute in this place, I do not understand. What I am sure of is that they will do it again today. They will join with the government again today and agree that it is unnecessary for senators to speak for any longer than 10 minutes and they will agree that it is unnecessary that there be debate on any document for more than 30 minutes. Therefore, as a result of the passage of this motion, the right of senators to contribute will be further restricted. </PARA>

This is a unanimous report. I remember sitting in the Procedure Committee meetings and going through the government's motion very carefully. We decided that it was not reasonable. The opposition, however, had some compromise ideas which it put up. They were very good ideas and, if I recall correctly, this is one of them. This is a very good compromise motion which, if I remember correctly, came from an opposition member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it is a compromise motion, because it is not the government's original motion, which would not have been particularly fair, because it is not exactly what the opposition wanted, because it is not exactly what we wanted, and because it is not exactly what the Independents wanted, we will have to come up with a compromise. That compromise will have to stand. It is that or it is something unfair in one direction or another. In the end, I hope we will end up with this one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators may remember 2 February 1994, a very interesting date with respect to procedure in this chamber. That was the day we adopted new sessional orders. Opposition senators might remember them. Then again they might not because they never listen to a word I am saying. They talk amongst themselves. They did not listen at the time, did they? We had a debate on how standing orders should be changed. We decided to do it under sessional orders. During that debate, this whole argument was raised. We debated extensively in the Procedure Committee the changes to sessional orders. Those who were on the Procedure Committee will remember this. Before 2 February 1994 the committee came up with a unanimous decision which was put up in the Procedure Committee report. You can go back and look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee addressed what the time limits for debates on government documents ought to be. We came up with a sessional order which gave us an hour on Tuesdays, an hour on Wednesdays and an hour and a half on Thursdays. That was supposed to apply to debates on documents, but that has not happened. Documents come in by leave and documents come in at other times. This is loophole that everybody agreed should be looked at. We did not all agree that it should be changed; we just agreed that it should be looked at. A lot of us agreed that it should be changed. The Procedure Committee came up with this compromise change to sessional orders which would close that loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee also said that we should review the operation of this provision early next year. I am sure all senators will agree that the changed sessional orders are not working in all ways. We have to look at how they can be changed. This is one of the most urgent things that need to be changed. It is not working the way it was supposed to work and the way we agreed it would work on 2 February 1994. After a year of trying it out, it is not doing what we agreed it should do in that Procedure Committee report before 2 February 1994. </PARA>

It has nothing to do with fairness between the opposition and the government or the minor parties. It relates to the way in which documents are dealt with. Under standing orders, rules apply to documents which are tabled in the normal course of events. Under standing orders, senators have five minutes in some cases and 10 minutes in others in which to make their speeches. The unfairness arises when documents happen to be presented to the President during a non-sitting period and are then tabled in here by the President. They get treated differently, in that half-hour speeches are able to be given and there is no overall time limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone who wants to speak on a document which has been tabled in that way&mdash;it is all accidental&mdash;is advantaged. Those documents that are tabled in the normal course of events on a sitting day get treated differently. I do not think that is a fair way of dealing with things. That especially applies to the question of people wanting to encourage documents to be made available to the parliament as soon as possible. That is why we introduced the method by which documents&mdash;whether they be from the Auditor-General, ministers or committees&mdash;can be presented to the President during a non-sitting period and then formally tabled once the Senate meets again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that everyone would think that a reasonable way to go. But, if this proposal gets defeated, it means that there is an encouragement for committees and ministers to wait until the Senate meets again before tabling documents. I would have thought that the whole process goes hand in hand with a procedure which enables documents to be made public, presented to the President as soon as possible but, once the Senate meets again, tabled in here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to enunciate a couple of basic rights. One right that was violated most enormously last week by a supine, cowardly government is the right of access of parliamentarians and the public to the parliament. This government allowed this parliament to be ransomed by a bunch of strikers or protesters, who blocked access to this place. I do not mind protests, but I do mind very much when the access roads to the parliament are blocked, as they were then with big trucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a community of over 3,000 people in this building through the working week. Any of them, particularly some members of the government, could have easily succumbed to a heart attack. There could have been any sort of accident in this building&mdash;there could have been a fire&mdash;in which case help could not have been brought to this building. There would have been a delay of at least half an hour, because the drivers of those trucks were often nowhere in sight. So there is a practical element to the principle of freedom of access to this building by parliamentarians and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great principle about parliamentary democracy is freedom of speech. It involves the unqualified right to debate whatever we like in this place. That basic freedom is assailed by the proposition which is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the Democrats might think, the great fight in this building is not between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party; the fight is fundamentally between the executive government&mdash;the ministry&mdash;and the parliament. The basic point we make, and have always made, of the democratic system is that the executive government is answerable to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a fool would believe that the executive government volunteers information. The executive government of any political persuasion has to have information dragged out of it. It is the ability of the parliament to have access to that executive which keeps the executive government honest. If we do not have that, we have a dishonest and disintegrating government and a disintegrating democratic system. There is a very fundamental, important reason as to why the executive should be able to be examined. So many of the reports that come before this parliament in some way or other deal with the executive government's actions. So any abrogation of that right to debate those reports is a sanctuary for the executive government to shelter in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the Democrats being in collusion with the Labor Party. I look forward to the time when we get into government in a few months, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) calls the election, because we will see the disintegration of the Labor Party as we know it. It has cut itself off from its union base very effectively. A new party will be formed out of the mad Left and the Democrats and some residue in the Labor Party. But that is all for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say this as a senior opposition senator: in my time here I know of no group of individuals that has assaulted the institution of the parliament more than the Democrats. They have a total lack of principle and policies and demonstrate rank opportunism. They have assaulted the institution of parliament in a way that no other party or group has done since Federation. We have seen the further mindless exercise of that today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to the limitation of time on the debating of reports. This parliament, in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, commissions a number of reports either through standing committees, statutory committees or select committees. In addition, we get reports from government statutory authorities. All of those reports that are set out are to provide information to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the committees that we have set up in this Senate alone would have cost many hundreds of thousands of dollars to see through to completion. It would be very interesting to do an audit on what the committee system actually costs the parliament in bringing witnesses before committees, holding hearings and printing reports. It is no exaggeration to say that, in the case of big inquiries, it would run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Their reports should be debated in the parliament, because the parliament has commissioned them for knowledge. We now have a situation being foisted upon us by these non-democratic people, who have no understanding of what the parliament is about, that will deny the opportunity for the parliament to debate those reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because Senator Schacht does not understand, I will give an example. One of the biggest reports to come before this parliament in the last month and a half of sitting time was the defence white paper, which came in around 10 December. That is a fundamentally important document for Australia. The time for its debate was really very restricted under the existing system. Under the system that the government wants to impose on us, there would be one speaker from the Labor Party for 10 minutes, one from the Liberal Party and one from the National Party in the entire debate. It is a paper which affects Australia's defence capabilities for the next 10 or 15 years. Such examples are legion. Many reports in that  category should be debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we hear from the Labor Party is some whining about how if it allows us to keep on going in the way we have, which has been the practice for a very long time, we will find that it cannot predict its program. I have news for the Labor Party. We do not run the Senate or the House of Representatives purely for the convenience of the Labor Party; we run it for the people of Australia and their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that I have been here, I have seen speaking rights abridged enormously. When I first came into this chamber, every senator could speak for one hour on every bill. We are now back to 20 minutes, which is one-third of the original time we had. We had the opportunity to speak on the first reading of a money bill. That has now disappeared. We had one hour to speak on the adjournment to raise matters that concerned us. It was then cut back to 30 minutes. It is now back to 10 minutes per speech for a total time of 40 minutes per night. It is an absolute absurdity on what it was before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it has. The quality is not the key. I was bored witless year after year while a fellow who was known by Senator Schacht's own party as `Feathers' McLaren railed about the rent that Doug Anthony was paying for his house in Canberra. Night after night the same thing came out. No thinking person could agree that the quality now is worse than when the Labor Party was in opposition. That is a delusion of a magnitude I could not encompass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the point that the opportunities in the parliament have been greatly circumscribed. We have seen a run-down in the government's ability to govern as a consequence. The newspapers say that we need a good opposition to have a good government. I do not care how good the opposition is; there will never be a good government when a Labor government is in power. But when we are denied the right to inquire and criticise the government, as the Democrats and the Labor Party have increasingly moved against us, the ability to be an effective opposition is very much circumscribed. As Senator Hill said, it is all part of a pattern to reduce the power of the chamber to go down the path of the one-party state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to all of these problems, if they are real, is it to extend the sitting year. I have always maintained that the sitting time for the Senate was far too short. Since the Labor Party has been in power we have seen the sitting year shortened compared to what it was in the time when we were in government, which I thought was too short. We used to sit in those days for three sitting weeks and then have one week in recess. We sat for three days a week. So we had nine sitting days per month. Nowadays we have two weeks on and two weeks off and we sit for four days a week. We have eight sitting days per month. We have lost a day there. Everywhere you look the evidence is overwhelming that the sitting year of the parliament should be extended so that we do the things that we are elected to do and become professionals in our job, not just mere ciphers for whatever caucus might decide. I trenchantly oppose this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate may or may not recall that in 1989 I brought a private member's bill to the Senate regarding an end of war list for the Vietnam veterans. It followed some six months of petition and debate in the House. The Senate may remember that it was also a time of great momentum for the recognition of the Vietnam veterans, led by the 1987 coming home parade, a very moving event, and the beginnings of the establishment of the war memorial, or shrine, for the Vietnam veterans in Anzac Parade, which I believe was finally opened in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The catalyst for my own endeavours was the story of the 23-year-old Second Lieutenant John Fraser. John Fraser is symbolic of the many unsung heroes of the Vietnam War, this controversial war. It should be noted that my private member's bill was never a comment on the war itself. It did not take either side of this controversial war but rather the side of those who served in the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just briefly, the story of John Fraser is that he was killed on 26 March 1968 when he deliberately kept both feet on an activated mine, a jumping jack mine, to give his platoon time to take cover. That is the short version of John Fraser's heroic act. It seemed right to me at the time to establish a tribunal to review the acts of bravery that were overlooked and that were deserving of recognition in this war&mdash;that if there was one such unsung hero as John Fraser there could well be more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of the Gold Coast, let alone John Fraser's family, have not forgotten John Fraser and his giving up his life for his country. The people of the Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise have established a park in the heart of Surfers Paradise dedicated to his memory. But it seems the defence department has forgotten John Fraser. This has brought great hurt to his family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an invitation by the defence department to Vietnam veterans that there may be some back pay and that they should apply for it, his family did so, be it that there was no back pay deserving to John Fraser. The hurt came by the fact that the defence department wrote back to John Fraser himself and not to the author of the letter, which happened to be his brother Fred. This callous bureaucratic error brought hurt to Fred and his family.

The bureaucrats should never lose sight of the fact that they are dealing with people, not procedures and regulations. Every single letter they send out is to a person and it is important. I ask the minister to address this error and express regret so the family's hurt does not continue for a day longer. They believe that the defence department has not recognised the death of their son and brother, John Fraser, let alone his heroic act, which was many times brought before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence department has acted in a typically bureaucratic way. It has written a standard letter back to a man who died over 23 years ago. It does not even have on the record that this man died for the country and that he has passed away. Obviously the department did not even read the letter that Fred Fraser had sent. You would have thought it was a simple procedure simply to write back to the author of the letter. Instead, the department wrote back to the dead John Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family cannot see past the fact that their lost son and brother died while serving their country. At the very least, the defence department should have had this on record. One would have to wonder how many times this has happened before&mdash;how many others have written to the defence department taking up its invitation for back pay in the Vietnam War and received the same callous and at least careless reply from the defence department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister or the head of the defence department can send a letter of regret, it will signal that the system has some feeling in it and accepts the consequences of its mistake.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to take the opportunity tonight to say something of the shambles our superannuation arrangements are in. I support the use of superannuation. Ideally, it should be part of our personal planning for retirement, but at the very least it is now part of the award system which catches almost everybody. Presently, of course, that award system is employer funded. The government is looking at the possibility that it be contributed to by employees, and the coalition has indicated that it will look very favourably at that suggestion when it comes forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A massive amount of money is involved, and it is money that is of great economic significance to our economic system. I have been dismayed that it has been indicated in recent surveys that there is a massive collapse in consumer confidence in superannuation. I guess we all have anecdotal examples of that. Frankly, I do not understand the way our superannuation system works, and I am sure the great majority of average Australian workers do not either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations found that 75 per cent of superannuants did not have enough information to understand how the compulsory superannuation system worked. The survey results, which were used as the basis of a report by the Australian Consumers Council, found that more than 50 per cent of people believed  superannuation was a bad investment, while 43 per cent felt they had little control of or access to their money. This is in a nation where we have a chronic problem with not encouraging enough savings. We need to do that so that we can have a greater percentage of home-grown investment, which has flow-on effects in controlling our foreign debt and other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than one-fifth of the respondents said they had difficulty moving money between funds. Sixty per cent said they could not understand the correspondence from their funds. I think we can all sympathise and empathise with that. It is no wonder they feel this way. Over the last number of years, on average there has been a change to the superannuation act every 28 days. Financial advisers and experts, let alone the average person, would have trouble keeping up with this uncertainty. Small employers, like me, have no confidence in the way that the superannuation funds work either. Quite clearly, fund fees and tax are white-anting the futures of all working people, where there is an all party agreement that super is vital to a rapidly ageing Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current failure of the Treasurer, Mr Willis, to rule out further tax rises on superannuation proves that Labor sees retirement savings as a convenient milch cow. Since 1983 this government has increased the tax on superannuation by nearly 900 per cent, with revenue increasing from $7 million to $1.5 billion last financial year. Since the 1993 election, the tax advantage on a superannuation investment of $1,000 has been reduced from $230 to $190. On top of this, most funds have had a disastrous last 12 months&mdash;many of them returning losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it simply, any further reduction in returns from extra tax imposts will significantly undermine people's willingness to invest in long-term savings. Raising superannuation taxes means that the benefits to the employee are reduced, forcing a greater percentage of the population onto the age pension. As I have said, with a rapidly ageing population that is something which must not be encouraged. This plainly contradicts the government's claim that its strategy is to reduce dependence on the public purse. The coalition has firmly committed itself to not increasing the tax burden on superannuation funds in retirement. The government has failed to do this&mdash;in fact, it has indicated the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect that deeply concerns me is the government's inaction on small amounts protection for casual employees. There are lots of examples of this. Anybody involved in paying casual employees, like shearers, would be aware of the complexity and the lack of certainty. You feel as though you are writing a cheque to the benefit of somebody who has earned it, has worked hard for it, but you have very  little confidence that at the end of the day it will be properly accounted to for that person. The system does not work very well because, after you have written a cheque to the superannuation fund, frequently in the next 12 months you get asked by the employee, `Have you done it? What has happened to the money?' There is no confidence from the employer's point of view and certainly no confidence from the employee's point of view either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, where these small funds are held by superannuation companies, the administration charges eat up the value very quickly. At the end of the day people could be paying superannuation companies for the benefit of their having had their money invested over a period of years where people have not been in compulsory superannuation schemes for very long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I float this suggestion: one body, one organisation, in the country has absolute records on all taxpayers. It has the tax file number. I refer to the Australian Taxation Office. I note that from 1 July it will administer small funds deposited with it. As an employer who pays the PAYE component of an employee wage or salary, I can say it would be very simple for the superannuation guarantee levy to be paid and administered in the same way. A number of options could take place in the way the Australian Taxation Office wants to administer those funds. This idea has some merit because the Australian Taxation Office is the one organisation that has a complete record of Australian taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the weekend we had the extraordinary spectacle of the government finally admitting what we have been telling it for months and months: the budget deficit is out of control and it must reduce its own spending if it is to bring the deficit into order. It was a classical example of why this government is simply not believed anymore, why this government has absolutely no credibility in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been telling us for months and months that expenditure has been cut to the bone, that there is no room left to save any money, and dropping all these hints about tax increases. Then we had the spectacle of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) telling us completely the opposite: that there is plenty of room to make big cuts, that the government will all of a sudden decide to target its spending to where it is needed and that, look out, here it comes&mdash;the government will be cutting into its spending. The government now looks absolutely stupid, with all the Prime Minister's rhetoric being completely contradicted by his own Minister for Finance. Mr Beazley is now the most famous deficit dalek of them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of what has happened, today I asked the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) whether she was still prepared to support her policy of giving child-care assistance to millionaires. The minister, unusually, refused this time, having been asked about this policy ever since it was introduced, to endorse her own policy. She backed off with the camouflage that she was not prepared to discuss things that might be in the budget. This is an existing policy. This is being paid out today and every day to anybody who wants it and qualifies regardless of their income or their means. The minister refuses to endorse the policy because she knows that she is about to be rolled on this issue. It is quite clear that the government has finally woken up and knows that this policy must be changed and will be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Crowley will be absolutely humiliated in relation to this issue. She knows that that policy should have been brought in on the basis of means testing, that she should have accepted the coalition's amendments to the proposal to provide for means testing of this benefit and that this government and this country cannot afford and should not be providing these sorts of measures for millionaires and very high income earners. The minister's policy of not means testing the child-care rebate is absolutely irresponsible. It was nothing more than an election bribe made in the passionate heat of the 1993 election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at the history of this measure. Labor ministers going way back have resisted all the urging from within the Public Service to bring in this measure. Peter Walsh was the most best-known defender of sanity and responsible policy in this area, having tried to stop the government succumbing to the pleadings of the special interest groups, particularly the Public Service. This is a classic case of a government which is making policy of the Public Service, by the Public Service, for the Public Service. When a government succumbs to that, you know it is finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a classic case of a policy that has been designed to benefit well-paid public servants and has nothing to do with the constituency, which the Labor Party proclaims to represent. In the Labor Party's desperation in 1993, it made yet another promise which it probably thought it would not have to implement&mdash;it could make it irresponsibly and recklessly&mdash;but made it in the hope that it might get it over the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, responsibly, did not attempt to match the promise because it knew that it was irresponsible. But, lo and behold, the government found itself back in office with a $150 million a year rope around its neck. The policy is fiscally reckless. The government's budget deficit is out of control. We now have a government which budgets on the basis of asset sales being used in one-off ways to artificially reduce the budget deficit. The government has artificially reduced it this year. Now we see that the Qantas sale will not happen this year. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported today that the government may well not get the money it is expecting for Qantas anyway, so the budget deficit is really in trouble. All of a sudden, these reckless promises which the government made in 1993 are coming back to haunt it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this policy of not means testing the child-care rebate reckless and irresponsible; it is also terribly unfair to a significant component of mothers in this country. It completely ignores the position of mothers who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home. I do not think the Labor Party realised this when it introduced this policy and when it promised it in the 1993 campaign. Of course, when it did bring it in, it unleashed a veritable storm across Australia on the part of those mothers who have sacrificed an income to care for their children at home. They suddenly saw their sisters who made the choice of going back into the full-time work force being paid to do so by the government, having all their child-care expenses paid regardless of whether they were earning $100,000, $200,000 or $500,000 a year, while they struggle at home to bring up their children with very little assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the cost; it is a very important matter that, when you make public policy, it must be fair and reasonable and not discriminate against particular groups in the community. The government's argument is&mdash;as I was reminded by Mr Keating's words in 1993 on the news tonight&mdash;`It is not really welfare; it is a right. It is an expenditure incurred in earning an income.' Simplistically and superficially that may seem the case, but that argument can then be extended to every expenditure which men or women incur in earning an income. Why doesn't it include having the gardening done, the housekeeping done, the ironing done, the dog walked or all the other numerous expenses that occur domestically when you go into the paid work force? It is a nonsensical argument when it is taken to its logical end, and it ignores the fact that it is incredibly unfair, discriminatory and biased against those who choose to care for their children at home. Government policy should not deliberately bias the choice that mothers make as to what their arrangements are going to be with their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many within the Labor movement have recognised this inequity. Martin Ferguson said only yesterday that it was absolutely ridiculous to be paying millionaires for their child care. An unnamed minister is quoted in the Sunday newspapers as saying that it was nonsensical. The shop assistants union moved a motion in Senator Crowley's own home state to bring in a means test on this benefit. The minister and the government have got themselves in an awful bind. They are about to break yet another election promise. Not only did we have the l-a-w tax cuts from 1993 that have been broken already, and will be further broken no doubt, but we have yet another election bribe that is going to be broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has no credibility. I say to the voters of Australia: do not believe anything that this government tells you in the lead-up to the 1995-96 election. There is nothing this government offers you or promises you that you should believe, because this government has no credibility whatsoever. The government should have accepted our amendments when this proposition came in. It should have accepted the coalition point of view that this was fiscally irresponsible. We have been attacked relentlessly by the government for saying that the budget deficit should be reduced, and attacked by it saying that we have not come up with ways of doing it. This is a classic instance of when we did say, `Here is a simple way that you can contain your expenditure&mdash;by means testing this benefit.' It would not only have benefits for the budget but benefits of fairness and good public policy. But, again, through the cynical political machinations of the government and its desperation to win an election, it ignored us. Of course, the  minister's only defence today was to say, `You voted for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved the amendments on the basis that, if the government and the Democrats did not accept our amendments, we would ultimately&mdash;but reluctantly&mdash;support the bill. The four factions of the Labor Party had the numbers anyway and, of course, if we opposed the bill in toto, no doubt the government would have run around the country attacking us for denying mothers in the paid work force any child-care rebate at all. It is a pathetic defence of the minister to now say, `You on the other side ended up voting for it.' She knows full well we argued passionately and determinedly for this proposal to be means tested, to no avail unfortunately. Now it is coming back to haunt her. I look forward to the government's admitting its mistake; admitting to the Australian people that they were misled and that they were bribed; and admitting that fiscal responsibility is something that the government&mdash;unfortunately far too late&mdash;will now take seriously. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Is November one of the peak months for illegal vessel activity in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) At the time of this incident, was Coastwatch fully operation; if not, why not and to what extent was it operational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Did the co-operative arrangements with Indonesia fail on this occasion; if so, why and in what way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) With respect to inter-agency communication, were all opportunities for closer liaison and co-operation recognised and taken with respect to this incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Have all recommendations from the Suspect Illegal Entrant Vessel (SIEV) investigation been implemented; if not, which have not been implemented and why.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) If the recommendations and findings from the report have been implemented, has there been a failure in minimising the recurrence of SIEV landings despite their implementation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Coastwatch, as a matter of course, conducts a post operation evaluation of all major incidents. Such an evaluation has been completed for this incident. The evaluation was not "independent" in the sense that it was conducted by Coastwatch officers. However, these officers had not been involved in any way in the events leading up to the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Appropriate inter-agency mechanisms are in place to co-ordinate the collection of intelligence concerning vessels potentially seeking to enter Australia illegally. In this case, no intelligence was available to indicate that the vessel was en route to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Customs Service; the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Department of Defence; Australian Federal Police; and Australian Quarantine Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Coastwatch surveillance planning is driven by specific surveillance priorities and threat areas identified by client government agencies. The clients submit bids to Coastwatch supporting appropriate levels of aerial and surface surveillance effort, in keeping with the assessed level of threat. The client agencies include the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the Australian Customs Service, and the Australian Nature Conservation Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. In the five years prior to 1994 only two other vessels have arrived in the month of November. The first in 1989 and the second in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Yes. All programmed surveillance tasks were achieved at the time of the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) There was no prior information from the Indonesian authorities on the movement of the vessel. Full support was received from the Indonesians when Australia sought to return the passengers to Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Commonwealth agencies with a direct interest in suspect illegal entrant vessels were in close liaison at the time of the incident. Close liaison between Coastwatch and its clients is normal practice, and whenever information about possible suspect illegal entry vessels (SIEV) arrivals comes to notice this liaison is intensified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) All recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the Investigation into Arrival of Suspect Illegal Entrant Vessel (SIEV) into Montague Sound</EMPHASIS> have been implemented. However, in relation to Recommendation No. 5, a Resource Agreement was not established with the Department of Finance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware that an area to the north east of the St Mary's site supports four endangered plant species listed in Schedule 1 to the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, administered by the Environment Protection Agency was triggered in relation to proposals for demolition and decontamination at Australian Defence Industries' St Mary's site in June 1992, before the endangered plants were discovered on the site. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment and as the remediation is being undertaken to NSW Environment Protection Authority specifications, the Environment Protection Agency and the NSW Department of Planning agreed that the Commonwealth would use the NSW planning and assessment processes as the primary vehicles for assessing environmental effects. The Environment Protection Agency will build its requirements into the NSW process and will ensure that proper account is taken of possible effects on the endangered species.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Environment Protection Agency and the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service are currently involved in monitoring and providing advice to Australian Defence Industries on the environmental effects of decontamination procedures. The Australian Heritage Commission has provided advice to Australian Defence Industries with regard to the built environment. The role of my portfolio in relation to further developments on the site will be determined when further specific development proposals are made.</PARA>
